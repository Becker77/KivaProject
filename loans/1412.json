This is where Martha lives, a 57 year old married mother of six children, 4 adults and two minors aged 15 and 17 that are attending high school. Her husband is a mason and with the scarce resources she had and the assistance of the first loan she built a small farmyard and purchased chickens for raising. Currently she houses as many as a hundred chickens which she raises for an appropriate period of time until they're ready for market, at which point they're picked up by sellers at her home or she sells to other residents of her area either by the chicken or by the pound depending on what the customer needs. With this she and her family get by when her husband doesn't find work, and this is all thanks to the support of the loans offered by the Foundation. This loan is to purchase chickens, feed and medicine for the chickens. She's been in Grupo de Credito for over 4 years and she enjoys it because the loans allow her to get by. Her dream is to provide her children with the best."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1589547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase chickens, feed and medicine for chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-04-28T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-28T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700.66,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":217.53,"local_amount":210.21,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":217.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832946},{"amount":145.01,"local_amount":140.14,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":145.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258993},{"amount":145,"local_amount":140.14,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541247},{"amount":145,"local_amount":140.14,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530024441},{"amount":72.46,"local_amount":70.03,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":72.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516567}],"funded_date":"2014-04-30T14:56:09Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T12:53:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manolo Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":703001,"name":"Lennie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lennie is 50 years old and lives in Sumasap, Panaon, Misamis Occidental.

trabajo formal, solo estudi\u00f3 hasta el bachillerato y no encontr\u00f3 oportunidad en alg\u00fan empleo formal.\n\nPara la realizaci\u00f3n de esta tarea, ella se levanta todos los d\u00edas a las 04H00 am. para dejar preparando el desayuno y el almuerzo para sus hijos que quedaran en casa solos hasta la tarde donde regresara de esta faena.\nAl llegar a los adentros del manglar, es muy dif\u00edcil la tarea, ya que para sacar 1 o 2 conchas, se debe introducir la mano en el lodo a una profundidad de 50 - 60 cm y al tacto lograr encontrar la concha, de no ser as\u00ed, se busca otro lugar hasta encontrar el producto.\nMuchas veces, nos encontramos con reptiles, y pejesapos, que al picar, produce fiebre, debilidad y seg\u00fan el reptil, puede producir la muerte.\nlos lugares de donde se saca la concha quedan a una hora y media desde San Lorenzo, mar a fuera. y los due\u00f1os de las embarcaciones, nos compran las 100 conchas en $8,00; para luego venderles a los intermediarios a un precio de $14,00 dice Madeline.  \nCon este cr\u00e9dito, ella espera convertirse en intermediaria, ya que conoce lo que con sus compa\u00f1eros sufren realizando esta tarea.

She is a single mother and has two sons, ages six and four who attend school.  Madeline says she decided on this line of work because there was no opportunity for a more formal job.  She only has a high school education and did not find any other work.\r\n\r\nIn order to do her work, she gets up every day at 4:00 a.m. to prepare breakfast and lunch for her children who stay home alone until she gets back from work.\r\n\r\nHer work inside the swamp is very difficult since she must stick her hand down in the mud about 50 to 60 cm and feel her way around to find one or two molluscs.  If she does not find anything she must move on until she does.  Many times there are reptiles and toads that can bite and produce fever and weakness.  Depending on the type of reptile it can even cause death.  The swamp fishing area is an hour and a half from San Lorenzo, in the ocean, and the boat owners buy 100 molluscs for $8.00, then sell them to intermediaries at a price of $14.00, says Madeline.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she wants to become an intermediary since she knows how much her colleagues suffer doing this work.  She wants to pay a just price and be able to expand in the business so she can feed her children better food and spend more time at home with them.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nMadeline is the one raising her hand up in the photograph.  She is the leader of the group of eight people who will receive loans of $400, $500, $1,000 and $1,200, depending on how long they have been in the group.\r\n\r\nTheir previous loans were repaid on a normal basis, with nothing further to mention.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5100,"image":{"id":1579335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable

The oldest child is 20 years old and the youngest one is seven years old. Abla is the leader of the group. Despite miserable conditions, she didn't surrender, instead she decided to help her husband with the family's expenses. Abla started up her tailoring business seven years ago. She started by tailoring children's clothes who lived in her area with a small amount of capital. Recently, she has earned a good income, but unfortunately most of what she earns goes to  pay for the children's expenses. She is working hard to improve her business, but she lacks the materials. For this reason, she has applied for a 50.000 YER loan from AMB in order to purchase more tailoring materials, such as fabric, zippers, buttons, and many spools of thread.

a clothing factory originally founded by an Italian national.   She has been working for a long time and does not make a lot of money, but she has enough, in general, to meet her daily needs.  Svetlana has long been thinking about changing the windows of her house, but she never had the means to do it for lack of sufficient funds.  The house in which she lives with her \u200b\u200bhusband and two children is a good-quality house, made of bricks.  It is in very good condition, whitewashed and meticulously kept.  Old-fashioned windows are the only problem: they let the cold air in during the winter, and heat is lost.  As a consequence, Svetlana has to spend more than necessary on energy and gas bills in order to keep the house warm.  In order to spend less on gas, which the family uses to heat the house in the fall and winter, they have decided to change all the windows in the house, and for this, they need 8,000 hryvnia.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1590276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

He plans to use this sum of money to buy tangerines, apples, cucumbers, pineapples and dried fruits.  He dreams of building his own house one day and to open a small store inside his house, where he would sell fruits and vegetables.  In the meantime, he wants to continue to develop his business thanks to which, as a matter of fact, he is able to support his entire family (his wife and his two daughters, ages 7 and 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1590268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase tangerines, apples, cucumbers, pineapples and dried fruit for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Khoost","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-04-29T03:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-29T03:20:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":59.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vasiliy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":424}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.44,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-17T12:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":421.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":479157380},{"amount":37.44,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":421.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490851608},{"amount":37.44,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":421.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504278219},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":418.06,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":423.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.07,"payment_id":517560813},{"amount":35.71,"local_amount":415.12,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":420.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.65,"payment_id":542536393},{"amount":59.66,"local_amount":830.82,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":841.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.11,"payment_id":561669467},{"amount":29.5,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":421.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.94,"payment_id":579589157},{"amount":117.73,"local_amount":1672,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1693.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.75,"payment_id":595183123}],"funded_date":"2014-04-30T00:09:14Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:20:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":700238,"name":"Nelly Martina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En Los Bajos de Montecristi, ciudad conocida por su gran diversidad de productos t\u00edpicos como por ejemplo los sombreros de paja toquillas conocidos dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds se re\u00fanen cada 15  d\u00edas las socias del Grupo de Cr\u00e9dito Mujeres Por EL Progreso.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Nelly, tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen tres hijos mayores de edad, uno de ellos aun vive en su casa.

They live in large traditional families in the Niebala quarter of the town of Bougouni. They know one another through neighborhood, friendship and business ties. To strengthen their financial capacity, in order to better run their business, they joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, with which they are on their second loan. The previous loan was properly repaid. This group of women sells grain and traditional soaps, like Sali, who is the third woman standing in the photo from the left to the right. With her loan, she expects to buy 500 kilograms of corn, 400 kilograms of millet, and potash and oil for making traditional soap. She stocks up at the wholesalers of Bougouni. She makes her sales at the market and from her home, at retail, for cash and for credit to a mixed clientele. She expects to make an average monthly profit of 28,000 francs CFA which will be reinvested in her business and used to repay the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1592234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural

se ver\u00eda muy beneficiada con el convenio que kiva le puede ofrecer a ella. \n","en":"Her name is Jakeline. She likes nursing because she learns to be more humane, humble and above all, responsible for completely fulfilling all of the expectations of this major. Her biggest motivation is being able to offer a service with which she can help a lot of people, because she feels that this is her vocation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this will help family and her community. She lives in the countryside and there aren't enough resources to serve the population. Often there are accidents from tools and insect and reptile bites. The hospital is also very far away in the event of any accident. \r\n\r\nThat is why she is motivated to study healthcare. She is only asking for a chance to make her dreams come true and help her community. At this time, she doesn't have the resources she needs to make her monthly payments. That is why the Kiva contract will be very beneficial to her. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1590442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester's tuition.

She is married now and has two children who are studying at a local school.  Berta's husband has been a construction worker for many years.\r\n\r\nBerta has a business making and selling antojitos.  She sells what she makes in the surrounding neighborhoods.  She started the business three years ago, only selling from home at first, then branching out so that she now delivers what she makes right to her customers' homes.  It's worth mentioning that Berta operates the business by herself.  Making the antojitos and selling them falls to her and her alone.  She also manages the household and takes care of the children.\r\n\r\nBerta is applying for CrediCampo loan, part of which she will use to buy bulk supplies of yucca and cooking oil and the rest to buy a cart.  The cart will allow her to buy bulk supplies of the ingredients she needs and make the most of the available discounts.  \r\n\r\nFor the future, Berta would like to open a restaurant.  The mild climate of the region is popular with tourists who come here from all over the country and Berta thinks a restaurant would do very well.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1590551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

demonstrating his intelligence.  He has supported his household this way for two years, amid the poverty that surrounds him, which makes people find honest ways to support their families.  Wilmer is proud to be surrounded by such high spirited people who go out humbly each day to find ways to feed their families.  This inspires Wilmer; to see his peers refusing to fall, but quite the opposite; turning this problem into an advantage, a means to improve and a means to receive his first micro loan so he can fix his grinder and buy supplies to increase his weekly production and deliver his product to more restaurants and distribution centers.  He wants to achieve his dream of turning his village into a place of work and effort for a group of poor humble workers who will turn their poor area into one with abundant workers and employers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1589486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to fix his grinder.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Monter\u00eda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-04-29T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-29T13:40:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilmer Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":35258},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":36236},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":37241},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":38274},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":39335},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40426},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41547},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":42700},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":43884},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":45099}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.45,"local_amount":34574,"processed_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-05-22T10:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":37534.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":480245782},{"amount":21.48,"local_amount":38180,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":41448.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856603},{"amount":22.39,"local_amount":39810,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":43218.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504283263},{"amount":49.06,"local_amount":87213,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":94679.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983655},{"amount":112.62,"local_amount":200223,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":217364.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531790291}],"funded_date":"2014-04-29T14:14:26Z","paid_date":"2014-09-25T09:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

He is married, and has 2 children aged 10 and 7 years, both attend school. He has 2 additional dependents, who live with him as they are  school going children who also help in domestic work.  In 2005, John established his tailoring business. He began his business because he dropped out of school at Form 4 due to lack of support. He later entered into a vocational training school where he was trained in tailoring for a year and six months, and after graduating he established his own tailoring shop.  Working 6 days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about SLL 2,500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of SLL 3,000,000 in order to purchase dozens of \"gara\" material, \"Bamakoh\", cotton materials, poplin, satins and sewing materials.

She has devoted herself to her work and to bringing up her three children.  Having been born into a humble family, Bertha, along with her husband, have managed to support their family.  They have had various different jobs, including selling goods, which is what they are doing currently thanks to the help and cooperation of a friend who showed them how she ran a shop of this kind. When she first started out in this business, Bertha faced the difficulty of shortage of capital to get the shop up and running.  This is a very common problem in this group of entrepreneurs in Colombia who are all very keen to work and make something of themselves. They are, however, held up by the lack of money and lose their motivation and end up giving up on their dreams and just work for someone else. But capital was not a problem for Bertha because she was granted a microloan which enabled her to start up her shop. In spite of her age, she has big ambitions - she wants to extend her business, have a better quality of life and have things which she could only dream of before when she was in dire straits. This led Bertha to and look for an opportunity in the form of financial help to buy merchandise to help her increase her income and clientele so she can continue hoping for and dreaming of a better

Her oldest child is 7 years old and the youngest one is 2 years old.  She is the leader of the group. Siham lives with her family in their own house. She is an uneducated woman, but she is very dynamic and vigorous. Her husband is an employee in the private sector, and he has a small shop in his area. He earns a good amount of money from this a small business, but the salary that he receives from the private sector is small. Unfortunately, the family's house is very old, and it threatens to fall down at any time. It needs a renovation. \r\n\r\nThis thing needs a lot of money, but Siham and her husband don't have enough money to do that. As a result, Siham is requesting a loan of 70,000 YER from AMB. She will use the loan to purchase construction materials such as cement, bricks, wood, and planks in order to make a quick renovation for the house.\r\n\r\nSiham's dream in the future is building one more floor and renovating it.

The businesses run by members of the community association are varied including: raising rabbits, agriculture and livestock, purchase and sale of cattle, selling milk, ice cream sales, raising chickens and selling cheese.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe loan which they will take out will benefit small microentrepreneurs where Flora is a member.She says that it is the first time that she has been a member of Pro Mujer , she joined after being invited by one of the institution's consultants who visited her at home. Today she has a business selling ice cream; she says that she started this business several years ago with the support of her husband, who already knew the trade.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe loan which she is now taking out is in order to increase her capital for the purchase of essences and a refrigerator - which she will buy in the shops of the city of El Alto - and then after making the ice-cream she will sell it in her retail space. This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her family, as she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen I ask what she likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the training offered by the institution.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1590621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy essences and a fridge","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-04-29T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-29T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loyola Jesusa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2233.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2332.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2395.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2460.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2527.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2596},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2667.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2740.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2776.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":376.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":386.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":397.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":402.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":323.88,"local_amount":2233.63,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-18T09:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2237.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838726},{"amount":329.12,"local_amount":2269.8,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264756},{"amount":338.22,"local_amount":2332.52,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546859},{"amount":347.35,"local_amount":2395.52,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2400.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030023},{"amount":723.28,"local_amount":4988.16,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4997.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522241},{"amount":1563.15,"local_amount":10780.37,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10801.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655887}],"funded_date":"2014-05-28T18:07:51Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:20:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"amanda moody","image":null}},{"id":703433,"name":"Teofila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teofila is 51 years old and married with four children, one of whom is in school.

Homa Bay County is located at the southwestern tip of Kenya and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people. A market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay County often boasts traders from Ugandan, Tanzania and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay county means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result, school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average.\r\n\r\nTetio is married and has one child. He is a teacher and his wife is a social worker. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for three years now and they are currently growing sunflowers, horticultural crops, maize and beans on their farm. Tetio is excited about beekeeping as it is an easy project to take up and it has a ready market.\r\n\r\nThis is Tetio's first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to invest in his farm. Tetio's hope for the future is to be able to support his family and to use honey more as his bread spread.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":12.28,"image":{"id":1590043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

To earn a decent living, Anthony sells pineapples from his farm, besides engaging in other small personal businesses. \r\n\r\nAnthony is quite satisfied with the returns farming generates. The only challenges are getting enough capital to diversify, and the marketing of produce.  \r\n\r\nTo access training, technical assistance and financial solutions, Anthony mobilized farmers to form a group and join Juhudi Kilimo. When asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo, he answered, \u2018It assists small holder farmers.'  Through the training sessions, he learnt effective ways to use loans and how to shift from subsistence dairy farming to commercial dairy farming.\r\n\r\nAnthony has two traditional cows, namely Wambui and Machaka, that do not produce much milk. Anthony is seeking a loan to purchase a grade dairy cow. This type of cow produces 15 to 20 litres of milk a day. The cows he has now produce 3 to 5 litres each. A grade cow will provide Anthony with enough income to repay the loan comfortably and save extra money.

When Henry learned about Kiva through Juhudi Kilimo, he said, \"They do meet my needs. It is the company who elevates living standards of smallholder farmers.\"\r\n\r\nMost of Henry's monthly income is spent on transportation costs. He loves riding on motorcycles and dreams of owning a Suzuki CRB 750 in this lifetime. But today, Henry is seeking a loan to start horticulture. He strongly believes it is the way he can pull himself out of poverty. He has attended numerous training sessions: He is confident he has the skills, knowledge and passion to succeed. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Henry's family will benefit from the prestige of having a better living standard, resulting in his three children looking up to him and seeing him as the provider of financial security they will enjoy in future.

Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts, and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes.
