She used to work at a bar and also had a small fast food stand. Her last job was with a company that she had to leave when they changed management. She used her severance pay to set up her hot wing stand, and the business has been very well received by the people in and around the neighborhood. Her main market advantage is that she has no direct competition, that is, there are no other hot wing stands around. Her work schedule is ten hours, fourteen on the weekends.

She is very well known in her community for the work that she does, butchering and selling pork.  She is the mother of three sons and three daughters.  Mar\u00eda was raised by her parents who worked In agriculture, livestock, and selling pork.  In time, she found a job in a local butcher shop where she worked selling meat.  This is where she gained her knowledge and experience.  \r\n\r\nAfter a long time, she decided to branch out on her own, and she received a loan to open her own business with her husband.  This business butchers pigs to be sold in the community.  The business started out on the weekends, and she began to generate a customer base.  Now, she also sells pupusas everyday of the week in the afternoons, which her two eldest daughters help her with.  Her husband and her two eldest sons help butchering the pigs.  Her schedule for selling the pupusas is from 3pm to 8pm, and her daughters help her.  She has ten years of experience making pupusas, which she learned how to make when she was working in a restaurant in her town where she put in a lot of effort, was very attentive and was eager to learn everything that they were teaching her.  Selling the pupusas is one of her main sources of income.  Her children attend school in the community.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase a larger grill to make pupusas as the one that she currently has is too small, and the demand from her old and new customers increases everyday.  This is making it urgent for her to purchase better equipment in order to perform her work more efficiently.  She also wants to open a store as the first store in her town is one kilometer from her home.  This will allow her to  generate greater earnings that will be invested in repairing her home so that they will have a better quality of life and a home in better condition.  \r\n\r\nHer goals for the future are to open a new location in a different area of her community, and expand her pupuseria.  Opening a new location will help her to provide better service to her customers since she will be closer to them.  Regarding her children, she hopes that they will be able to get ahead, regardless of the obstacles.  She plans to support them with all of her strength so that they can be successful professionals.

She is very well-known in her community.  She was raised by her parents, who were farmers.  They were hardworking people who spent their whole lives farming and raising livestock.  When Ermelinda was living with her parents, she studied in the afternoons in a local school.  This is how she got an 8th grade education.  Later, she started working with her mother slaughtering pigs and selling their meat.  \r\n\r\nOver time, Ermelinda acquired experience and knowledge in this occupation, and she decided to form her own household.  She has 2 children who are both now independent.  Now her household is comprised of her husband and her 2 granddaughters, who help them with the business.\r\n\r\nErmelinda is continuing with her work slaughtering pigs and selling pork meat, and on weekdays she also makes tamales and bread to sell.  She learned these activities from her parents, who spent their whole lives doing this type of work.  Ermelinda now has 16 years of experience, and she has decided to continue with these activities in order to earn income, because much of the time these activities have been her main source of income.  This is how she has fed her family and covered the basic expenses of the household.  \r\n\r\nThe funds from this loan will be used to buy pigs to slaughter, and also to buy some utensils that she needs to carry out this activity.  She needs to replace some items that have worn out, including a table, knives, and plastic containers, because it is difficult to work with them as they are so deteriorated.  This will make the work she does inside the home much easier.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Ermelinda plans to have her own butcher shop in the center of town.  This would enable her to have more income and employ her granddaughters, who are the ones who help her with the business.  In this way, she could help them to reach for their dreams, because one of them says that she wants to be a chef and a cooking teacher.  All of this can be achieved if she invests her profits well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1590688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

Ella trabaja solo 4 d\u00edas a la semana, unas diez horas por d\u00eda, ya que tiene que dedicarles bastante tiempo a sus hijos; sin embargo, a pesar de no trabajar todos los d\u00edas, le va muy bien en su negocio. La se\u00f1ora Jessy  lleva ya en este negocio dos a\u00f1os.

Dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, la se\u00f1ora tiene un negocio  estable, con ventas diarias a entre 8 y 10 personas, y del que se siente orgullosa y muy agradecida ya que gracias a este ha podido darle una buena calidad de vida a sus hijos y adem\u00e1s ha conocido a mucha gente buena.\nCon el cr\u00e9dito que ha recibido, la se\u00f1ora tiene pensado comprar m\u00e1s juegos de sabanas, que son los productos que m\u00e1s vende. Adem\u00e1s, tiene pensado invertir parte del cr\u00e9dito en la medicina para su hijo con discapacidad. El sue\u00f1o de la se\u00f1ora es llegar a tener un sal\u00f3n de belleza\/spa bien implementado, ya que ha visto este giro muy promisorio y rentable. \n-La se\u00f1ora Jessy lleva ya dos ciclos con el grupo y refiere que hasta ahora todo ha ido de maravilla, y que se siente feliz de formar parte de este ya que tiene la oportunidad de socializar y compartir experiencias con otras madres como ella. Finalmente la se\u00f1ora comenta que se siente muy agradecida con los inversores extranjeros como KIVA que han hecho posible este cr\u00e9dito, y les hace la petici\u00f3n de seguir con esta loable labor de apoyo a gente necesitada con ganas de salir adelante.\n","en":"Jessy is a member of the communal bank, \"Madres Ladere\u00f1as\" and is a single mom with two children who are 10 and 11 years old, one of whom is disabled. At 37 years old, this lady has managed to raise her family thanks to her business selling clothing and sheets. She is the sole breadwinner of her family, having to ensure that her two school-age children have the food and the education they need, as well as looking after her own needs. \r\n\r\nApart from selling sheets, Jessy also sells all kinds of clothing for men, women, and children. She works only four days a week, ten hours a day, since she has to devote a substantial amount of time to her children. However, even though she doesn't work every day her business is going very well. She has been doing this for two years and says that it became a necessity when she and her husband separated and she had to assume responsibility for her children by herself. Prior to that she had been a housewife. Two years later she has a stable business, selling to between 8 and 10 people every day. She is very thankful and proud of this because it has allowed her to provide a good quality of life for her children and, in addition, she has met many good people.\r\n\r\nWith the money from the loan Jessy is planning to buy more sheet sets, which is what she sells the most. She is also thinking of using some of the money for medicine for her disabled son. Jessy's dream is to have a well-appointed beauty shop\/spa as she has seen that this can be a very promising and profitable business. \r\n\r\nJessy has now been through two loan cycles with this group and states that up to now everything has gone very well. She is happy to be a part of it because she has the opportunity to socialize and share her experiences with other mothers like her. Finally, she states that she is very grateful to foreign investors like KIVA who have made this loan possible and requests that they continue with this commendable work in support of needy people who strive to get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1502042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheets, which she sells most of, and also to buy medicine for her son.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2014-04-29T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-29T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Bella Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Humberto Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ana Melva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jessy Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1467},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1467},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1467},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1467},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1467},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1465}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":528.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":529.29,"local_amount":1467,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1470.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490825118},{"amount":529.29,"local_amount":1467,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1470.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504250843},{"amount":529.29,"local_amount":1467,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1470.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517534142},{"amount":529.29,"local_amount":1467,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1470.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530017165},{"amount":529.28,"local_amount":1467,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1470.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542508951},{"amount":528.56,"local_amount":1465,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1468.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561642399}],"funded_date":"2014-05-17T12:31:28Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T11:50:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":702501,"name":"Mariama","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nMariama a 45 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants.

He also has a business where he distributes eggs store-to-store in the mornings. Because of his age, no one would give him a job. He is a married man. Along with his wife, he attends to his businesses. He sells his eggs in the only practical way he can, which is to say that he does not have a transport vehicle which means that he is at a great disadvantage because his age hinders his work. One way or another, he has to do it because this is his own livelihood for his home. Another downside is that he has to sell very cheaply because there is a lot of competition that prevents him from progressing. He cannot move because of lack of capital and the already mentioned problem of his age. He requires a loan for supporting his investment in the purchase of eggs to sell at a low cost to gain more customers.

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. It is located close to Uganda and Mount Elgon, an extinct volcano which straddles the two nations, and even has a peak at the Kenya-Uganda border. Founded by European settlers in the early 1900s, Kitale originally grew due to its proximity to the Ugandan railway. The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping. Kitale is the headquarters of the Kenya Seed Company, whose massive sunflower plantations provide nearby bees with a veritable buffet of high-quality forage.\r\n\r\nReuben is married and has seven children.

The majority of residents here are very hardworking and do jobs related to the ocean.\n\nDon Carlos lives in this place.  He is 36 years old and married.  He has six children from his marriage, five of whom still live at home and are elementary and high school students.  His wife is a homemaker and works seasonally, cleaning fish.\n\nIn order to get necessities for his home, from a young age Don Carlos has worked in the fishing industry and in trade.  Everyday he heads out to the beach at dawn to buy what his neighbors have caught fishing, to later clean with the help of his wife and resell to traders who come to this place in order to take the fish to other cities.  On some days, he also heads out to fish, and in this way he fights from day to day to give his family the best.\n\nThis loan is to buy fishing supplies, fish, and shrimp, which he will resell.  He has been in this credit group from the beginning and he likes the opportunity to get loans.  His desire is that his family wants for nothing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1585776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fishing supplies, fish, and shrimp","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jaramijo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-04-29T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-29T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1085.07,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":90.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":271.26,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490832928},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504258975},{"amount":183.32,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":183.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541229},{"amount":183.32,"local_amount":180.84,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":183.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530024423},{"amount":275.02,"local_amount":271.29,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":275.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516551}],"funded_date":"2014-05-06T13:10:54Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T12:53:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":703598,"name":"Hani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hani is a 29-year-old single man from Gaza City.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay County is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nLoise is married and has nine children. She runs a small business of selling cereals. Both she and her husband are farmers. They have been farming for eight years now and they are currently growing maize, beans, millet, and soy beans in their farm. Loise is excited about beekeeping as it is an easy project that she can manage at her age. \r\n\r\nThis is Loise's first loan with Honey Care and she plans to use the proceeds from her beehives to expand her business and buy a cow.

Her main customers are young people, who are the most innovative when it comes to getting dressed. She has sold clothes to up to eight youngsters every day, on average. She is confident that she will be able to pay this loan and says that she will use it to buy covers, threads and zippers, which are the materials she uses the most when making clothes.\r\n\r\nDespite not getting paid sometimes for some works she has done, she has been able to overcome such obstacles. Her dream is to be able to open a big workshop one day and have some employees under her charge.

He organizes the sale of them from his own car, which he drives through his city. He has already been running this business for five years. Before, his mother used to help him with the sale of fruits and vegetables, but now Garnik manages all alone, since his mother is already old and it is not easy for her to work with her son all day long.

He works every day and has not had any problem because he is his own boss and sets his own working pace and methods.\r\n\r\nHe works independently and needs a microloan to buy pigs to expand his business and be able to sell to more customers. Many times, they have needed pigs from him and he has not been able to sell them because he does not have enough of them. This is why this loan will help him to grow and take more orders, which would result in his professional growth, always staying close to his origins. This process has taken some years, but he took the first step as an entrepreneur. He started a company and without knowing, he is applying concepts such as \u201cinduced demand\u201d when he sells. Each sale represents progress for him and creates momentum to reach his goal of increasing his profits and have a long-lasting business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1590721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy pigs and increase his profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Monter\u00eda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-04-29T21:30:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-29T21:30:26Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u00c1ngel Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42838},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44023},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45242},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46494},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47781},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49104},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50463},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51860},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53295},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54770},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56286},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57844}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.18},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22,"local_amount":40624,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":42303.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490856610},{"amount":23.24,"local_amount":42912,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":44686.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504283268},{"amount":24.46,"local_amount":45166,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":47033.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983660},{"amount":25.1,"local_amount":46336,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":48252.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531790297},{"amount":25.78,"local_amount":47596,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":49564.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542541807},{"amount":55.83,"local_amount":105174,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":109523.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.14,"payment_id":561674775},{"amount":23.62,"local_amount":49997,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52064.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.47,"payment_id":595188585},{"amount":51.31,"local_amount":108898,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":113401.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.68,"payment_id":611813701},{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":113297,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":117982.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.59,"payment_id":636621335}],"funded_date":"2014-05-18T23:44:07Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:26:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":702988,"name":"Armenuhi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armenuhi and her husband have two children, 23 and 21 years old.Armenuhi and her family also run a farm.

She was raised by her parents who worked in agriculture and also provided transportation services with their minivan. It was her parents who instilled those values in her and who helped her to get ahead and become a good person. In the mornings she helped her dad with the farming, and in the afternoon she went to school, managing to finish 9th grade in the local school. \r\n\r\nWith the passage of time, she was able to acquire much knowledge and experience about farming and transportation services, and began to work full-time with her father. As the eldest of her siblings, this is how she became independent and met her husband with whom she now has five children. They study at the local primary school. \r\n\r\nDominga has 15 years of experience in transportation and doing household work. She inherited the minivan from her father which she is currently using to provide transportation services with the help of her husband. She is motivated by the money she earns and by her commitment to provide the best for her family. On days when her transportation services are not needed, she tends to her corn and bean crops which help to feed the family. Saturdays and Sundays are the busiest days for transportation, when she gives rides to people from different areas who go shopping at the market.\r\n\r\nThe money from the loan will be used to repair the transmission on the minivan. Lately there has been increased demand for her service, and the repairs and adjustments will make the minivan more reliable and allow her to provide better service to her customers, resulting in more income. The income generated will be used to cover basic household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to pay back the loan and take out a larger one to buy a new vehicle since the one she has is old and is having some problems. She also plans to support her children with their education until they become successful professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1590709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Vulnerable

business, which has been operating for 12 years with great results since he keeps the market he has established. \r\n\r\nHis economic activity is roasting peanuts that he buys from people who gather up the harvest leftovers and he processes them. He is married, and his wife and daughter also have a clothes selling business in Managua which is an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nRecently he came to Ceprodel to request financing to use in buying 200 quintals of peanuts, as a business opportunity.

This is 30 year old Smiling  from Gokwe. She is married with three children and two are attending school. She also cares for one other dependent. Smiling  runs a retail business selling groceries, cooking oil, sugar, flour, and washing powders. The business has been in operation for 3 years.

Martha was abandoned by her son's father about a year ago and since then she thought the business would help her pay her bills and for her small son.\r\n\r\nHer shop is located in a good area since there are few shops in the community where she lives. Martha hopes, with this loan, to stock her store more and offer her neighbors more products. She is convinced that in five years she will have her own house where she can live with her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1562314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable

She is married and has four children between the ages of twenty and thirty-one. Three of her children are still in the school system. She also takes care of another person.\r\n\r\nFor eleven years already, she has been dying all sort of clothes from home to resell.

She makes French treats, such as madeleines, cakes and brioches, and also sells homemade juices.

We heard many stories from the field. Most of them succeeded in breeding their pigs. The pigs grew well and were free from disease. They sold the pigs for a satisfactory price and the group earned some profit. \r\n\r\nNi Wayan is raising pigs to fatten. She sold the pigs after managing them for five months. She said thank you to all the lenders, Kiva and MUK for the support. Now she can improve her income and support her husband. Ni Wayan has a dream of renewing her house when she has enough profit to do that. That\u2019s why she's saving now.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully paying off the last loan, they proceeded to the next period with the purpose of improving their businesses. One member already successfully manages her pig business and is continuing with her own money, so she was replaced by a new member.

He grew up with his parents and grandfather who worked in agriculture from a young age, especially growing basic grains and raising livestock.  Jose has no academic training because back in his day it was difficult to get an education because of their scarce economic resources.  So he began working in agriculture and livestock farming with his grandfather.  Over time, he acquired experience and knowledge in the field and decided to become independent and establish his household.  His wife is a homemaker and they are the parents of two children, ages ten and 17 who attend school.  Jose participated in a six-month bricklayer training course 11 years ago and obtained a certificate.  This is his strongest business activity and source of income.  His second source is agriculture, in order to support his family.\r\n\r\nJose has been working as a bricklayer for ten years having learned the trade through training courses offered by the government's solidarity programs.  When there is no demand for construction jobs he works in agriculture, a trade learned from his parents and grandfather.  He decided to continue this activity because of the good economic results and the fact that it is his main source of income to support the family.  His eldest son also helps in the work and he believes he is capable of excelling in this activity in the future.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to pay off a debt with a hardware shop, since that is where he acquired most of his work tools.  The rest will be used to buy materials to build a sidewalk around his house and to repair the roof because rainy season is approaching.  He must protect his family because they are the ones who provide him with love, motivation and strength to continue his work.\r\n\r\nJose's goal is to have a well-furnished home and to build on two rooms for his children.  He also wants to pay off the loan and obtain a new one to buy construction tools and support his children in their education until they become successful professionals.  With his profits and a good management of the loan he hopes to buy his own vehicle to transport construction materials and equipment, and to be able to go out and enjoy time with family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1590716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"To pay off a debt with a hardware shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-30T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-30T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":180.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":196.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":214.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":233.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":702691,"name":"Adol\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Adol\u00e9 voit son activit\u00e9 grandir compte tenu du fait qu'elle met en pratique les formations sur les th\u00e8mes tels que: Augmenter ses gains, Relation avec clients, gestion de stock; Actuellement elle a beaucoup de client et sollicite ce nouveau cr\u00e9dit pour acheter 50 trousseaux b\u00e9b\u00e9 et 20 douzaines d'assiettes plastiques.","en":"Adol\u00e9 has managed to grow her business thanks to the training that she has undertaken.

The practice was prevalent in India wherein women were married to deity\/temple at a very young age.

Although the system was abolished in 1988, the condition remains appalling.\r\n\r\nRekha, 43, is living in a backward area of Lakkur village, Belgaum, Karnataka. She stays with her two sons and her partner. Her parents dedicated her as a devadasi to the goddess of Yallamma in her earlier age. She has made sure that both her sons are educated. One is studying ITI and the other is in the 8th grade. Rekha did not want her daughters to go through what she did as a devadasi so got her two daughters married and they are well settled with their husbands. Rekha remained illiterate as she was pushed into the devadasi system at a very young age.\r\n\r\nShe has almost 20 years of experience in the timber business. Her partner helps her with the business. Rekha is requesting a loan to purchase wholesale firewood and furniture made of timber. She sells the timber for firewood and the furniture daily and earns around INR 5,000 per month. Rekha hopes to make some profit, as it is a very crucial for their survival as well for her childrens\u2019 education.\r\n\r\nRekha dreams of seeing her two sons holding a job in the government sector.

The group consists of nine members including Rekha. Their main occupation is labor work in agriculture fields. They all are requesting a loan for goat rearing and buffalo rearing. They gather weekly for an SHG meeting to discuss their loans, repayments, and savings. They even help out each other with individual and community problems.

This is Ronald. He is the Head teacher at Light High School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Ssegukku, Wakiso Distrct with 405 students. Light High has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nLight High School will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Shaban ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1090,"image":{"id":1594618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Matugga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2014-04-30T08:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-30T08:50:06Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":73.73,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katalemwa School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6801750,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":455700},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":453000},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":453000},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":453000},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":453000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":453000},{"due_date":"2018-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4081050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.48},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1635}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":182.57,"local_amount":455700,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T14:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":457333.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490853619},{"amount":181.49,"local_amount":453000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:51:30Z","rounded_local_amount":454623.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504280538},{"amount":180.86,"local_amount":453000,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":454623.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":579593876},{"amount":171.27,"local_amount":453000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-28T09:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":454623.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.22,"payment_id":624862435},{"amount":150.85,"local_amount":453000,"processed_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":454623.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.63,"payment_id":681370717},{"amount":149.23,"local_amount":453000,"processed_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":454623.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.25,"payment_id":755507005}],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T16:44:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":703972,"name":"Hanan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanan is a 43-year-old married woman from Ramallah City.

She has 3 children aged 17, 13 and 5. She lives in her home with her partner (they are not married), her 3 children and her mother-in-law.  She and her partner share the household expenses between them. Jackeline sells food - breakfast, lunch and dinner - and so she works 10 hours a day. She has been involved in this business for two years and, every day,  serves a large number of people who go to her stall on account of her good flavours. She says that she is proud of what she does because her job has enabled her to support her family.  Before she set up her business she was a housewife.  However, when she realised that the money that her husband earned was not enough to cover all her family's needs, she felt obliged to use her talent for cooking to set up her own business.  So far it has proved very satisfying for her as it has enabled her, among other things, to provide good food for her children and pay for their schooling.  Jackeline is very excited about the loan because she will be able to use it buy more supplies for her business and make her dishes for which there is a high demand. Her dream is to continue making progress and to have a big, modern restaurant one day.
