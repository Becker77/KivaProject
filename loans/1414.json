Due to her economic conditions, she halted her studies and, later, became attached to a companion. She is a single mother with 2 sons, aged 23 and 22. Her companion abandoned her while her children were small and Lorena has had to raise them alone. One son is already attached and Lorena now lives with just one.\r\n\r\nLorena has had a business for the last 10 years.

Jharkhand. She lives with her husband and two children; a daughter and a son who go to school. Both husband and wife are illiterate, as their families could not afford the school fees, but they are working day and night to ensure their children are educated. \r\n\r\nShahzadi\u2019s husband, in search of work, reached Mumbai and got into the tailoring business. But he couldn\u2019t stay away from home for long, and hence, came back to his village and started a construction business. He earns around INR 300 per day.

The group takes a loan, then holds each other accountable for paying it back. On their behalf she is requesting a 6,350,000 TZS loan, her twentieth, through Kiva partner Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans, all paid back successfully, to restock her shop with popular drinks for her customers.\r\n<p>\r\n With her profits Elina has paid for household expenses. She is also happy and proud that with Kiva's support she has been able to pay college fees for one of her children. In the coming years she looks forward to improving her life and business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1595567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to restock drinks for her shop.

It is also a source of basic grains and good food for his children. \r\n\r\nIn the future Jose hopes to build a new house so that his children will have a healthier place to live and enjoy themselves, and so that future generations will have a better quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1407389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 2 quintals of urea, 3 quintals of sulphate, and 15 quintals of hen manure to fertilize his corn in its first and second stages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-04-30T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-30T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":43.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":704205,"name":"Gregorio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gregorio is a veteran cacao farmer, who was raised by his father who also farmed cacao. \r\n\r\nHe lives in a beautiful, cacao farming village in the Toledo District of southern Belize.

The women are eager to learn about effective business practices including accounting and budgeting. They also learn about health, native plants, and nutrition. \r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan cycle for the Trust Bank and the women are very excited and enthusiastic about this big step that they are about to take!

Totonicap\u00e1n is well-known as an area that produces beautiful \u201ctube type\u201d skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d, many of which are woven with \u201cikat\u201d type designs in various colors. These skirts are sold in marketplaces throughout Guatemala and are in great demand.\r\n\r\nTomasa is the 48-year-old Treasurer of the Trust Bank. In spite of the fact that she does not know how to read or write, she has been able to teach herself many things and does her job well. As is the case with the other ladies in the Trust Bank, Tomasa makes \u201ccortes\u201d and is requesting a loan to purchase a variety of thread which she will use to create new designs and increase her clientele. Her dream is to make enough income so that her last daughter, who is 13 years old, can attend school.\r\n\r\nTogether with the other ladies in the Trust Bank, Tomasa is happy to participate in the monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. There is an educational component to these meetings and the women learn about relevant subjects like healthy foods, women\u2019s rights, and the prevention of violence, as well as self-esteem. Other topics include accounting and budgeting, customer service and indebtedness.\r\n\r\nEach of the ladies in the \u201cMujeres de Chipuac\u201d Trust Bank are poised to enjoy a more prosperous and happier future because of the loans and educational trainings.

","en":"Gavhar has been involved in farming for many years.  This has been the family's business historically.  Her father and grandfathers had been involved in farming and supported their families with this business.  And Gavhar also loves working on the land.  She not only receives a monetary benefit, but also positive energy from the land, where she was born and raised.  She is also raising her children to love the land and nature.  Gavhar is 37 years old, married and has three children.  Of course, just as do other parents, she wants her children to get an education and become specialists in farming.  But Gavhar thinks that this dream is far from reality.  Gavhar's husband works in Russia.  He strives toward providing the family with all of life's necessities, but Gavhar does not sit with her hands down here in their native land.  She wants to plant wheat on her small plot of land.  She does not have enough money to buy mineral fertilizers.  She is glad that she can borrow the needed amount from

All of his life he had wanted to acquire a farm where he could work with crops and livestock. This is the story of Eugenio - a man who nourishes his spirit with hope. He is a farmer who gained knowledge from his father who trained him. He not only prepared him for life in the fields, but for everyday life. He taught him to live not just for work, but to feed his spirit with dreams and to set goals because a life without purpose is meaningless. \r\n\r\nThis is how he came to own a farm where he could grow the products he wanted. Thanks to his hard work, he was able to buy a plot of land where he works. It is the foundation of his family which includes his wife and two young children. However, he has a problem in that he lacks the tools and seeds needed to use 100% of his space and makes him lose revenue. This generated a request for financial support to buy supplies, seeds, and tools for agriculture that he has be unable to purchase due to the high cost of the products.

She started her business 2 years ago, when she lost her job and had to find another source of income in order to support her child, since she separated from her husband. Cleibeth has two businesses. The first consists in renting out a washing machine by the hour. The second one is retail: she sells women's and men's clothing directly to the customers. She sells both cash and on credit and works every day from 9 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon.

He eventually ended up in a job doing building maintenance in a high rise. One day when he came to work, he saw that the building had added an auto detailing service for its employees. Marcus told himself, \u201cI could do that,\u201d sparking a business idea that better fit his talents and experiences.\r\n\r\nHe eventually started Trophy Auto Spa, a full-service mechanic and detailing auto shop. Though starting at a storefront facility, his eventual goal is to acquire contracts with local companies to provide mobile detailing services for their employees. Marcus seeks to distinguish himself from his competitors through offering top quality service with integrity. Though still fairly new, Trophy Auto Spa already has rave reviews, with satisfied clients posting positive reviews on Yelp and spreading the word about Trophy Auto Spa.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan of $8,500 will enable Marcus to take courses at an auto detailing training school so that he can expand his services to include painless dent removal, windshield repair, window tinting and wheel recoating and restoration. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Marcus hopes to expand into a larger facility. He would also like to train more employees and take over the auto detailing services offered at the office buildings in the area.\r\n\r\nCheck them out on the web at:

Kessy used the previous loan to restock his business with chickens so as to grow. He has paid back the previous loan successfully. With his profit, he paid the school fees and household expenses. He dreams that one day he will be able to open another successful project so that his extra income will rise. We believe that with your loan support, Kessy will be able to meet his dreams and open a light to his family.\r\n\r\nHe will share this loan with his loan group Mapatano, which totals three members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":1596106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

They are requesting a loan from KIVA in order to maintain and grow their businesses. Some of their business endeavors include animal husbandry and the sale of various foods including vegetables, snacks and items for daily consumption.\r\nMarta is 46 years old, married, president of the Trust Bank, and has two children. Although she only has had two years of formal education, Marta is a self-taught woman who is filled with enthusiasm and urges her fellow Trust Bank members to move ahead and improve themselves. Marta is requesting a loan, which she will use to purchase three pigs that she will raise and then sell. She hopes to receive a good price for them so that together with her husband, the needs of the family can be met. It is especially important to the couple they meet the educational expenses of their youngest son, who is in elementary school.\r\nThe Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge combines small loans with non-formal education. As most of the clients have had little or no education, the ladies learn about various relevant and useful subjects from a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who meets with them each month. Some of these topics include effective business practices including accounting and budgeting, customer service and indebtedness. Among other subjects covered are nutrition and health, self esteem and women\u2019s rights.\r\nEach of the women in the Trust Bank extend their heartfelt thanks to KIVA investors for believing in them and funding their loans. They look forward to a brighter future as empowered women eliminating poverty! We look forward to sharing their progress with

Bozorgul has never had a job, but she is planning to start a small business. She is interested in selling ice cream because the weather is getting warmer and it is the season for ice cream. Bozorgul has $80 saved, but will need to take out a loan to buy an ice cream machine and start selling. She thinks that it will be a profitable business and hopes that she will have a chance to start earning money because she has no other support.

Her husband works in Russia like many men in Tajikistan. Her daughter is 10 and goes to school.\r\n\r\nFotimakhon has been sewing traditional clothing as a business for about three years.

He sells milk and calves. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Amosi has requested a loan of 3,000,000 UBX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to construct a wider crawl space and buy more calves, and will help Amosi to generate greater profits.

lively, friendly, sociable, honest and determined woman. She is 56 and has two children. She lives in a rural area and has raised livestock since childhood. She has no education and has therefore spent her whole life raising livestock. Her husband works at a local farm to earn money for the family but it is often not enough for the month. He helps her with the cattle when he is not at work, as this provides a large part of their family income. Her husband and buys and sells cattle and Musharam cares for them. They both work tirelessly to give their children a decent education and to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nMusharam is taking out a loan to buy more cattle to expand their business.

She invested her previous financing in paying labor to get her fields cleaned and the coffee beans harvested, as well as fertilizing her crops. Thanks to this financing, she feels that she was able to open a door just at the right time; she was worried that she might not be able to take care of the last of the maintenance that her coffee crop needed. She needed to give it a final fertilizer treatment, but she didn't have enough capital for it. Stores and other lenders were charging 8% interest, and even up to 10% monthly interest, depending on the need of the person taking advantage of it.
