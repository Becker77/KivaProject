She intends to use her loan to purchase lengths of \u2018pagne\u2019 cloth of any quality that she sells retail to a diverse customer base. She procures this cloth at the big market and at the big shops of Koutiala. \r\n\r\nWhile the other members of the group Danaya plan on making an average profit of 190,000 francs CFA each over the course of the loan cycle, Mariam plans on making 205,000 francs. \r\n\r\nIn addition to paying back the loans, the women use part of the revenues to cope with personal expenses and to increase their capital. They would like to see this Soro Yiriwaso partnership stronger, so as to avoid inventory shortages. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1594723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase 'pagne' cloth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-05-01T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-31T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67220.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961143},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":67220.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677485},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67220.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677148},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":67220.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209799},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":67220.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658660},{"amount":141.19,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67219.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":561792873}],"funded_date":"2014-05-09T13:49:02Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:09:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":701578,"name":"Elvia Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marina es una se\u00f1ora viuda, tiene 66 a\u00f1os de edad, ella se dedica a la agricultura y a la crianza de animales menores, Marina vive sola debido a que sus 7 hijos ya son independientes, Mariana  siembra a medias con uno de sus hijos y pagan a otras personas para que les ayuden a realizar el trabajo que necesiten las plantas, con este nuevo cr\u00e9dito ella va a sembrar sola, y lo va a invertir en la compra de abono y pagar mano de obra, comenta que en esta actividad de  cultivo de papas en algunas ocasiones   no le va tan bien porque el precio baja, pero ella es una se\u00f1ora perseverante y piensa positivamente y dice que en esta siembra va a tener buena ganancia, aspira incrementar su negocio  y seguir luchando hasta que Dios le de fuerzas.","en":"Marina, 66, is a widow.

A market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay County often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to sell their wares.

Her sales are made at the retail level to a mixed customer base paying with cash and often on credit. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. S\u00e9tou is hoping to make an average monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be used for supporting part of the family and increasing her capital. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1594731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fresh milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Douga W\u00ear\u00ea","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-05-01T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-31T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T18:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961144},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677486},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677149},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209801},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100830.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658661},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":100830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658662}],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T02:07:13Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T17:19:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":701582,"name":"Marta Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marta, tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su nuera y una nieta, se dedica a la venta de productos naturales Herbalife, lo aprendi\u00f3 de un amigo, ella alquila un local en el que tiene su negocio, su ventaja es la zona en la que est\u00e1 ubicada.\nComprar\u00e1 t\u00e9s, vitaminas, polvos para licuados, cremas, jabones, etc., que le ayuden a tener un mejor inventario para brindar un buen servicio a sus clientes, espera aumentar la afluencia de sus clientes, mejorar sus ventas e ingresos.\nSu visi\u00f3n es continuar trabajando para salir adelante junto a su familia. \n","en":"Marta is 57 and lives with her daughter-in-law and a granddaughter.

is the age of 28; she is mother of three children and living in Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband has been running a  general store for many years near his house and the business is operating very well. Earlier he was selling bakery items in large quantity but according to the customer\u2019s demand he wants to offer rice, sugar, flour etc. He does not want to refuse any product and disappoint any of his respected customers. He wants to offer all those products which are necessary and consumable in daily routine. In this way, he will successfully win the trust of his customers and increase his income as well. Therefore, Yasmeen requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband could buy the sacks of rice, sugar and flour for general store. She is very glad after taking this loan and hopeful that her husband will successfully fulfill each request for any item and prevent the disappointment of his customers. Yasmeen is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1583472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They are all now of age, and she was able, through her efforts, to give them a basic education as far as the ninth grade. Two of her children live with her, but they help her with her business. She has had a small snack stand for the past five years, which she opened when she separated from her husband. She decided to move herself and her children forward, and began with only some 25 dollars in inventory, which she has increased bit by bit. Now she has a more formal business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to remodel the roof of the snack stand and to make it a little bigger. With the money from the loan, she will buy sheet metal and wood to make the stand larger, because when it rains it gets very wet inside. The loan will help her a lot, because she won't have to be wondering what she will do every time it rains. She would like her children to do well for themselves and to move forward in the business, since she has showed them that with a good attitude and a little help, you

All of the members are also taking part in the poverty elimination program in order to improve their lives by learning the behavior of a successful woman.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Olga who makes delicious food.

Sanjukta makes dried fish by keeping the fish in sunlight until all the water in them evaporates and preserves them for future use (like when fish are not available in the market, in the rainy season). Dried fish is also used as a supplement to fresh fish. \r\n\r\nSanjukta is requesting a loan to buy a cool storage box for keeping fish, fishing net and insecticides to prevent fish from decaying for her fishery business. She says that this will help her in strengthening the business and responding to client demand. This group is made up of neighbors and friends who formed the Maa Sarala Self Help Group. The members of the group have selected Sanjukta as their president. The lady standing with her hand raised is Sanjukta. The common goal of the group is to increase their business activity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1577720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase a cool storage box, fishing net, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chandikhole, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-05-01T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-31T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Menakarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gedi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tbhanumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kokila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhumuri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jharana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koili","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-26T05:17:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":698975,"name":"Asif","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asif is taking loan to buy cosmetic products such as facial cream, face powder, lipstick, nail polish etc.\r\n\r\nHe is a 39 years-old married man who lives with his family in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

The members all get on very well due to their many years working together.  They live in the same village and all work as retailers.  Some of them also grow rain-fed crops.\r\n\r\nTamba (sitting fourth from the left with her hand raised, in the photo) is the group representative.  She is married and has five children, two boys and three girls.  She sells food products - sugar, green tea, bouillons and cigarettes.  She buys her stock on a wholesale or semi-wholesale basis at the market in her district, or at the weekly markets.  She then sells it on a retail basis in her village and the surrounding hamlets.

He is the father of a son. \r\n\r\nHe owns a small business, selling ready-made garments at a shop. He purchased ready-made garments from the market at a low price and he sells them at a high price. The women of the town like his clothing selection for dresses and they demand a greater variety to wear at wedding ceremonies. Nadeem also has a big collection of children's garments, as well. To the women, he suggests which dress suits them, which clothes suit their children, and which ones they should wear, according to the occasion. \r\n\r\nNadeem speaks with monotonous tone which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of his clients. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up a very good relationship with his customers. He does not have any other source of income except for this enterprise. \r\n\r\nDue to a rapid increase in household expenses and with the increase in inflation, Nadeem wants to grow his income, as well. Due to good relations, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stocks to cope with the demand. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Nadeem  requested a loan for his garment shop, so that he can buy more stocks of ready-made garments to sell. He hopes that this loan will prove productive and beneficial for his business, as well as for his family. \r\n\r\nNadeem gives thanks to Kiva, honorable lenders, and Brac Pakistan for this honorable support.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1588986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a greater variety of ready-made garments to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2014-05-01T14:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-31T14:30:12Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nadeem","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7244},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7456},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7674},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7898},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":8129},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":8367},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":8611},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":8863},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":9122},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9388},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":9663},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7585}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":699290,"name":"Samreen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samreen is 25 years old and lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

a small general store for many years and it works very well. His shop is situated in a populated area with lots of customers interested in buying miscellaneous general store items. He does not want to refuse and disappoint his respected customers. He wants to offer all those products which are necessary and needed daily. In this way he will win the trust of his customers and increase his income as well.

M.Moshin and his father earn income  for the family. \r\n\r\nHis shop is situated in the garments market and they have  a lot of competition. Due to this competition, it is very difficult to convince customers to pay a profitable price. This competition causes low sales and more effort. He has to stock the latest designs, prices, and fashionable colors to maintain the rate of sales.\r\n\r\nThe major problem is that the summers season is about to start and he does not have sufficient money to buy garments for the summer season. He does not want to reduce his sales and monthly income as well by not updating his inventory.\r\n\r\nTherefore, M. Mohsin has requested a loan from kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan to buy summer jeans, shirts, pants, t-shirts, and trousers.\r\n \r\nM.

He is the father of a son. He is a livestock trader and does most of his trading from within his home area. He breeds livestock in his yard as well and sells the bull calves to the butchers. He has to feed the calves for one or two years until they are grown up and healthy, which is very lengthy and expensive procedure. \r\nRecently, two of his healthy buffaloes suddenly died due to disease. He had been producing milk from the buffaloes and breeding them. \r\nMashooque wants to buy a buffalo to keep his income and business stable but he has already invested his all savings into miscellaneous expenses of the dairy farm. He does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy a buffalo to continue business smoothly. \r\nA field partner met with him and let him know about all the terms and conditions of Kiva loans through BRAC Pakistan. He agreed to the repayment schedule and signed all the necessary documents, including a client waiver. \r\nThe fatal diseases are the major challenge for him. He hopes that he will pay all the installments on time. With the profit amount he will buy fodder for cattle and medication to prevent diseases.\r\nMashooque is very pleased after taking this loan and thankful to BRAC Pakistan.

But, due to an unfavorable financial position, he is not in a condition to purchase fruit for his business purpose.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Razia has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC

She resides in Buhera District, Zimbabwe. Tinashe volunteers her time as a Camfed Learner Guide, teaching life skills education in local schools to improve the well-being of students by enhancing their learning environment. She also volunteers as a health trainer in her community. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Tinashe offers door-to-door delivery of old clothes and new clothes, where she sells products such as shoes, jeans, shirts, skirts, and T-shirts.

He has to feed the calves for one or two years until they are grown up and healthy, which is a very lengthy and expensive procedure. \r\nRecently, he made a plan to increase his dairy farm business because his production of milk and breeding procedure is not enough to fulfill his needs.  \r\nGulzar wants to buy a buffalo to keep his income and business stable but he has already invested his all savings into miscellaneous expenses of the dairy farm. He does not have sufficient cash on hand to buy a buffalo to continue running his business smoothly. \r\nA field partner met with him and let him know about all the loan terms and conditions of Kiva and BRAC Pakistan. He agreed on a repayment schedule and signed all the necessary documents, including a client waiver. \r\nGulzar requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so he would be able to purchase a new buffalo for his business. He hopes that lenders will support him and this loan will prove productive for his business.\r\nHe is very impressed with the Kiva loan system and he is thankful to the lenders. \r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1592116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Job Creation"],"use":"to purchase a new buffalo ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Hyderabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2014-05-01T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-05-31T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":18110},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":18639},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":19184},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":19745},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20322},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20916},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":21527},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":22156},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":22804},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":23470},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24156},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":18971}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":695074,"name":"Krishna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Krishna is a young woman from Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.

For the past many days his rickshaw has not been working properly so he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore Khalida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

Since he was a small boy, he grew up in the country at the side of his father, who was his best example of overcoming adversity and of responsibility. It was there that he learnt how to work the land and grow crops.

Her husband needs to repair his taxi because the current condition of his taxi is not good. The taxi requires more maintenance on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nDue to insufficient financial means, he is unable to pay for the maintenance of his taxi. Therefore, Yasmeen has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Yasmeen's husband can easily afford the maintenance costs and provide better transportation services to earn a profitable income. Yasmeen also plans to increase their savings with the profits from her husband's income to meet her family's needs in the future.\r\n\r\nYasmeen is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

This village was devastated by natural disasters and had to be relocated. It is a village whose people work in agriculture and selling lumber. Soraida lives with her two young children and her husband in a small house donated by the government. For the last four years, she has been selling sheets and perfume products. With this, her family has been able to get by, since her husband does not have a job. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy perfume and sheets on sale. With this, her business will have more merchandise in stock. It takes Soraida two days to buy sheets in Ibarra, seven hours from her village. Soraida's village doesn't have any health centers, and water doesn't run regularly. Students must go to nearby communities to attend school. Soraida sells her products on two weeks of credit, which is advantageous since it helps her earn more. This is Soraida's third loan, and she thinks it is great because it gives her the opportunity to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\nFive people in this group will receive $1800 each, since this is their third loan cycle. There are also two group members who are just joining the group, and they will receive $500 each. They all live in the same community and have different businesses.

She doesn't know how to read or write. Her parents experienced extreme economic hardship when she was a child, so they didn't put her in school to study. She is a widow, has 4 grown and married children, two of whom work outside of the country. In her home live a daughter and three grandchildren and these are the only people who are dependent upon her. Francisca works as a domestic employee. She says that since she was little she has worked in this field thanks to her mother who taught her this job. She was able to raise her 4 children and today is proud of her work and to take care of her grandchildren. <br \/><br \/>The loan she seeks will be used to consolidate debts, to pay for daily living expenses, be able to buy an iron, and to invest in her tortilla and puposa business.

Asma's husband needs to purchase different types of vegetables, meat and chicken in bulk quantities as well as other items for his business so that he can provide quality and delicious food to his customers, and improve his sales growth to earn a maximum profitable income.

She sells vegetables and tamales, something she has done in the same community where she lives and earns an income for her and her children. She has been selling for 10 years, so she has a lot of experience. She learned this business from her parents, as they were very poor and couldn't send her to school, so she had no other option but to work as a street vendor along with her parents. She works only a few meters from her house.

She is from the small town of Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.  She is 25 years old and married to Rahibul, who is a 26-year-old farmer.  They have two school-going children; one is in grade one and the other is in grade six.  Merina has an education up to grade eight, whereas her husband is illiterate.  They live in their own kaccha house (made of mud, straw and bamboo).\r\n\r\nMerina's husband is a humble and hardworking person who grows different kinds of vegetables.  He began to involve himself in farm work, in the company of his parents, since it was the only option they had to earn a living.\r\n\r\nThe harvest he collects is sold in the region's market but he cannot earn sufficient income from his present business to pay the family expenses and feed his wife and two children.

She plans to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and manure to cultivate this crop. Her plans for the future are to have a large plantation of this crop.  She can then earn more and strengthen the inheritance that she will leave for her children. In addition to this, Mahabuli's priority is the education of her children.\r\n\r\nShe aspires to start a photo studio in future with the additional profit, which will be earned from this business.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to BJS and Kiva for fulfilling her dreams by giving her a loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1590081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase jute seeds and necessary ingredients for jute cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-05-02T01:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-01T01:30:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahabuli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-09T23:47:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":704589,"name":"Teodosia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teodosia is 61 years old, married with two adult children.

She is married to Porimol and is a housewife . Together they are rearing two children (one daughter and one son). They live in their own kachha house (made of straw, bamboo and mud) in Shalbari in Dhupguri in the district Jalpaiguri. Sangita studied up to grade 7, whereas her husband, who is a farmer by trade, attended school up to grade 9. Her son goes to school and is in grade 9, whereas her daughter is too young.\r\n\r\nSangita's husband is active in growing farm produce.  He has been in agriculture for over five years.

He grows good quality products and sells at a reasonable rate, so he gets good customers.  But his family expenses are growing day by day and it is not possible for him to meet all the demands with his poor income.

She has a secondary education and she has been involved in animal husbandry for the past 35 years, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She bought her first cattle with 5,000 som (KGS) and thanks to her very hard work, she now owns three dairy cows, two horses, three calves and 15 sheep.  Batmakan sells milk and milk products at the local market.  Her monthly income comes close to 12,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nEager to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy some cows.  With more cattle Batmakan will be able to improve her material conditions as well as those of her family.  She is planning to reinvest her earnings from this loan into further increasing her number of domestic animals.

She is a 25-year-old young woman, married and a housewife. She is a smart, active woman who always pursues the well-being of her family. She is married to Mafikul, 38 years old, and has three children (two sons and one daughter).  All the children are school-going and are in primary classes. Hasina completed her primary education whereas her husband is uneducated.\r\n\r\nHasina's husband is engaged in farming. This is the only source of income for the family. Hasina helps her husband in his agricultural activities such as sowing and harvesting the crops.  But the income from the business is hardly enough to provide food and other household expenses for the family. Moreover, the educational costs of their children are growing day by day.

Asma also dreams of giving a good future to her child and having a Pakka house (made of bricks and cement) of her own with the profit from her business.\r\nAsma is obliged and grateful to Kiva and BJS for this financial assistance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1592042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy seeds, fertilizers and necessary ingredients to grow jutes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-05-02T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-01T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T14:38:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":704662,"name":"Paul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paul is 30 years old and from Naivasha.

In this way he earns a sufficient amount of income to meet the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet their everyday expenditures, more income is required so Saima contacted the Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of 45,000 PKR. Her husband will utilize this loan to purchase more items such as socks, waists, and elastics. Saima is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes to his business. Their dreams are to maximize their profits from this business and to have a better standard of
