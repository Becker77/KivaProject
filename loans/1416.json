She is a single mother to three children, who are now adults. Narcisa is originally from the Prinzapolka municipality and came to Rosita 30 years ago in search of a new job after the company where she worked closed down. Narcisa works as an assistant in a general store. She also has two stalls at the Rosita market, which she rents out for 3000 C\u00f3rdobas per month. For around 10 years Narcisa has had an unstable life. Every six months she must move a new home that she can afford to rent on her salary, or must stay with relatives. With a dream of owning her own secure home, Narcisa is applying for her first loan in order to buy materials - such as laminate zinc sheeting, nails and different types of wood - to build her house, and to cover the cost of labourers. Narcisa's dream is to have a home with everything she needs.

Though she is aware of different risks that may occur in the time of cultivation, yet she knows she can overcome those risks and hopes to have a good harvest of chillis. \r\n\r\nDipa thanks BJS and Kiva for helping her financially. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1592062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and necessary items for cultivation of chillis.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-05-02T15:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-01T15:30:19Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T19:01:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":704699,"name":"Otinkorang Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is made up of two women who are successful in their businesses and are part of the group called Otinkorang.

Meet Jamlick, a father of 3 who has been a mixed farmer for the last 7 years. He owns a small parcel of land Nkubu, Kenya, where he lives with his family. He makes a living selling milk and eggs from the farm. He also grows food crops on the piece of land, runs a transportation service with his motorbike and holds a job that pays him monthly salary.\r\n\r\nJamlick finds farming to be quite flexible. This gives him room to do many things at once. His biggest challenge however is the high cost of farm inputs.\r\nCurrently, most of Jamlick\u2019s income goes to school fees. The only way he can expand his business is through taking a loan to acquire assets that would immediately generate income to meet the loan\u2019s scheduled repayments. \r\n\r\nWith your loan donations, Jamlick will be able to construct a zero grazing unit. With this unit, Jamlick will improve milk production. A zero grazing unit confines a cow to a small feeding area so that most of its energy is driven to milk production. This unit will also free a lot of space to grow various grass species suitable for dairy animals. Part of the harvested grass will go to silage production and the surplus will be sold to neighbouring dairy farmers.

She has 5 children who get involved in different farming activities with their father. She only studied until third grade and could not continue with her education due to the lack of financial support from their family, whose financial situation was not favorable. This is her third season cultivating and harvesting coffee, an activity that she learned from her parents when she was a little girl. She has three years of experience and has a strong faith in the work she does with her husband and children. She expects to receive the support of Kiva lenders to buy farming supplies to protect and strengthen her coffee plantations this season.

Rural people use firewood for cooking purposes in their ovens. To sell firewood, at first, Jhumur's husband needs to purchase a log and cut it into pieces and then sell them in the market. Nowadays, the cost of firewood is going up.

Immaculate hopes that in the future, she will be able to open a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1596452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Youth"],"use":"to buy more sugar, soap, salt, posho, rice, cooking oil, tissue and toothpaste","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Seeta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 31.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2014-05-02T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-01T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Immaculate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":13370},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":13530},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13691},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":13854},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":14020},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":14187},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":14356},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":14528},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":14701},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14876},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":15054},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15234},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15415},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15599},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":15786},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15974},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16165},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16357},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":16553},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":65702,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":68956.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490797496},{"amount":23.57,"local_amount":56565,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":59367.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504219780},{"amount":19.27,"local_amount":46248,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T09:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":48539.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519783347},{"amount":26.62,"local_amount":63885,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67049.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529988856},{"amount":28.16,"local_amount":67600,"processed_date":"2014-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70948.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561615376}],"funded_date":"2014-05-02T23:03:37Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T11:18:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":704763,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda.

She has studied until seventh grade. She is living with her parents, her son and two daughters. Her elder son is studying ITI, one daughter is married and the other is studying in fifth grade. \n\nThe Devadasi system is an ancient tradition in which a young girl is married or \u2018dedicated\u2019 to a deity and performs religious rituals. The realities of a devadasi are extremely challenging since the young women are not able to complete their education, learn employable skills, or otherwise provide for themselves. The young women do not have a choice in this life long decision, which often leads to exploitation, poverty, and social exclusion.\n\nSittavva has struggled all her life to be out of the undesirable Devadasi system. Hence, she formed a group of ex-devadasis and took benefits from the Devadasi rehabilitation project. In 1996, her team participated in the Devadasi eradication movement. The group grew to have around 3,600 members.  They finally decided to form their own NGO called \u201cMASS\u201d in 1997. \n\nSittavva is the founding member of this organization. She is now an Executive Officer. She is earning INR 12,000 per month, which is paid by MASS under CRY program as she plays the role of child protection officer. Her income is the only source for her family. The government has provided a house for her family, which is in a bad condition. The roof is broken due because it leaks in the rainy season. Sittavva needs to renovate her house, for which she is seeking a loan of INR 20,000. \n\nSittavva is also a featured member of \u201cRukamani Mahila Sangh\u201d Self-Help Group (SHG). This group consists of (including Sittavva) nine members.  They all need a loan for different purpose like goat rearing, house renovation, animal breeding, and buffalo rearing. All except Sittavva are daily wage workers in the agriculture fields. They all are very hardworking women and they hope to save enough for their children\u2019s education.

She is 46 years old.  Maysara is divorced from her husband and lives together with her daughter and two grandsons.  Her daughter is 25 years old.  She is involved in sewing just like her mother.  Maysara has been providing seamstress services for over three years.  These services have become the primary source of income for Maysara's family.

Most of the residents of this village are poor and belong to Schedule Tribe, Schedule Caste and Other Backward Class. This village is surrounded by hills and natural rock plates, which is a blessing for the villagers to earn a livelihood. They prepare stone chips from the black granite stones of the hills, sell it to the builders and earn their livelihood.\r\n\r\nHimadri is an inhabitant of this village. The lady sitting in the middle with her hand raised in the photo is Himadri. She is 33 and resides with her husband, two sons and one daughter. The main source of income for Himadri is preparing and selling stone chips. She and her husband prepare stone chips. The stone chips prepared from the stone boulders are used inter-alia in the manufacture of concrete sleepers, construction of roads, bridges, buildings and other construction work. Himadri has been doing this business for the last 10 years and the earnings are just hand to mouth for her family. The reality is that, due to poor conditions, she brings an advance from the builders, prepares stone chips and sells them in distress to refund the advance. In spite of regular earnings, she is not able to improve her living conditions. So, to overcome this situation, in the year 2014 she formed a Self Help Group comprised of 10 members and each member took a loan of 12,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation. With this loan, she will purchase a big hammer, a small hammer and other materials for the preparation of stone chips. Now she will not have to go for an advance and bargain with the builder for her products, which will definitely fetch more income for her. Himadri hopes to construct a house and give a better life to her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1596636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase hammers and other materials to prepare stone chips.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"RISIGAON, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-05-03T01:10:44Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-02T01:10:44Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Himadri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chhayabati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kasturi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Namita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sambari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ghalandi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anusaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-12T14:01:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":705072,"name":"Numeriano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Numeriano is a 51-year-old married man.

He would go to school in the morning and in the afternoon he helped his father with farming, but things changed when his father passed away when Tomas was only 14 years old. It was at that time that he dropped out of school to help support his family, given that he was the oldest of the brothers, and so he was only able to study up until the third grade. He was in a common-law relationship and he has two children who are already in common-law relationships and do not live with him now. His partner passed away eight years ago and since then he has been alone.\r\n\r\nHis whole life, Tomas has made a living farming corn, which has supported him daily. He farms three hectares of corn and beans as well, which were handed down to him by his father when he died. His farm is located an average of 8 kilometers from his house and he has to walk daily.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from CrediCampo is to buy a pair of ox which he needs to go each day to his fields where he farms the corn and beans. In addition, this will improve his quality of life and he will also make trips hauling water in a wagon which the ox will pull. This will make him have an additional income and will also allow him to transport the sacks of grains from the land where he farms to his home, while saving him grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1592528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a pair of ox.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-03T01:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-02T01:30:23Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomas Ragalado","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":44.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":44.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":49.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":52.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":62.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Ronald","image":1493932}},{"id":704877,"name":"Norma Eli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norma Eli is a Kubo Financiero\u2019s client and this is her story:\r\n\r\nNorma is 36 years old, is married, and has four children; three of them are in school and that makes her proud.

It is considered the City of Filigree. I began to learn this art when I was 11 years old, with friends who taught me little by little. I enjoy it because a jeweler's work is a delicate art.

Sima has a higher secondary education whereas her husband studied up to grade 10.  Both could not go ahead with their studies due to their parents' poor economic situation.  Their daughters are in grade 9 and grade 1.\r\n\r\nSima is a housewife but her husband owns a clothing shop in the market where he sells mainly ladies' garments like sarees (Indian traditional ladies' wear), frocks etc. This garment shop is the only source of income for his family, which is the reason he devotes all of his time to the garment shop.  His shop is situated in the main market and there are a lot of competitors in the market.  Due to this competition, it is very difficult to convince customers to pay a high price.  He has to keep the latest designs, rates and delightful colors in the shop so that he can maintain the rate of sales. Now the major problem is that he does not have sufficient capital to buy clothing.\r\n\r\nSima has come forward to help her husband.  She has applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase clothing as he wants, so that her husband can cope with the market competition and generate sufficient income to look after his family well.

She is a very polite person well known in her community for the activity she does with her husband. She operates a transport service to the villages. She grew up with her parents farming and offering transport services with a pick-up truck and her parents taught her how to do this. In this way she managed to become a honest and helpful person. She helped her mother with the housework in the mornings and in the afternoon attended school where she completed her Grade 8. With the passing of time she gained a lot of experience and knowledge about housework and the transport business and began to work full time with her father as she was the oldest of her siblings.<br \/><br \/>Saturdays and Sundays are the busiest days for the business as they transport the people from the different areas and villages who come out to buy at the market. In this way she became independent and met her husband. They decided to marry and now they have 3 children who are studying in the local school. <br \/><br \/>The money from the loan will be used to repair the steering and buy tires for the truck. Lately there has been a lot of demand for their service and with the repairs and adjustments to their truck they can offer a better service to their customers. This will make them more profits which will be used for the basic necessities of their household and in improving their home. <br \/><br \/>The plans Anselma has for the future are to pay off the loan and save a larger amount of money to purchase a new vehicle as the one they have is old and has some problems.

She has two sons and one daughter. All of her children are studying at the local primary school. She has her own business, a store where she sells basic products. Her store is located in the center of her community. She is a very hardworking, responsible person who has both moral and spiritual values and principles. She is very well-known in her community for her business activity, for raising pigs, and for her manner with her neighbors.\r\n\r\nShe started to work in a store when she was young, which is where she started to gain experience. She later took out a loan to open her own store and started with her own business. She is still working, and with the help of her husband she brings home the daily sustenance to her family and guarantees that her sons and daughter have their basic rights.\r\n\r\nShe has fifteen years of experience working in the store and raising pigs. Her experience working in a store gave her knowledge and experience for this business. She learned about raising pigs from her parents, and her husband and two oldest children help with this activity.\r\n\r\nShe will invest this loan in the purchase of rice, beans, sugar, detergent, personal products, oil, condiments, etc. She will also buy pigs to raise and later sell. This has become her main source of income, and she will be able to offer her clients a better service and noticeably increase her store's financial profit.

She is married to Juanito and they have children. She and her husband manage their household and operate a business. They work hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a one-unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which earns *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community members. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP every day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nTo help her to continue her business, she requests 8,000 PHP to buy spare parts and maintain her jeepney unit. She expects to increase her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nAlicia dreams to have another  jeepney unit and hopes that her family will always be in good health. She meets with her co-fellowship** members to weekly share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\nCuriously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance
