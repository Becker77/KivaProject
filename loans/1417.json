He learned this work from his parents and has been doing it for more than 50 years. Due to the legacy that his family left and their extensive lands, he was able to earn the loyalty of a group of customers who sell his produce, with which he is able to support his family. <br \/><br \/>Owing to the extreme climate changes that have occurred in the area, he has lost a lot of crops. Although he knows that they are lost and that this often happens to farmers, it is very clear to him that this micro-enterprise is the only source of money that he has, and due to his advanced age, he is not able to find other work.<br \/><br \/> He is requesting a loan for the purchase of farming supplies, seeds, and fertilizers in order to increase his production and support his crops. This is his only desire, since Jos\u00e9 is sure that this will be the only thing that will be with him when life is lacking.<br \/><br \/>Note: The loan appears under Ana's name, as Jos\u00e9 is very

Rafael says he has lived in Ecuador for 5 years and he appreciates the fact that it is a peaceful country to live in."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1592685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"San Gabriel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2014-05-04T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-03T06:50:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Segundo Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":61.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":68.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":69.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":72.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.71,"local_amount":53.71,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":53.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504256134},{"amount":60.69,"local_amount":60.69,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":60.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517539510},{"amount":62.47,"local_amount":62.47,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":62.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530545877},{"amount":64.67,"local_amount":64.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":64.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542514532},{"amount":68.91,"local_amount":68.91,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":68.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561647975},{"amount":70.53,"local_amount":70.53,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":70.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579562667},{"amount":139.02,"local_amount":139.02,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":139.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595160184},{"amount":71.26,"local_amount":71.26,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":71.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624845749},{"amount":208.74,"local_amount":208.74,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":208.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636491092}],"funded_date":"2014-05-13T18:07:53Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:35:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":705352,"name":"Rochelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rochelle is 37 years old and married.

She has two adult children and has owned a family bar and a restaurant for 15 years, when she started to sell lunches to business employees and construction workers. Her most important products today at her restaurant are breakfasts and regular lunches, which she offers door to door and on request from construction sites. Her business leaves a 50% margin, which is why she is always ready to work non-stop from Monday to Friday, 6am to 4pm. She buys ingredients in the market and in barns, where she founds better prices. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business and to offer a better food service, so that she can improve every day. Her biggest challenge is to make it sustainable and to be able to meet its financial obligations.

She is married, a housewife and a mother of three. Her husband, Madan, is engaged in his own small business. They live in their own kaccha house (a house made of mud, bamboo and straw).\r\n\r\nAnjali's husband works very hard. He makes cane baskets and sells his products on foot throughout the different markets near her place of residence. With the earnings from his business, somehow they manage their household expenses.

and hardworking 39-year-old man. He is married and has two children. He first contacted Arvand when he learned of the possibility of obtaining financial support. Ravshan lives with his family in a small town. He does not have a higher education because his family's financial hardship kept him from going to a university. Ravshan's wife doesn't have an education either and as a housewife takes care of domestic duties and raising the children. To earn an income to support the family Ravshan runs his own business feeding and selling cattle. He also works sometimes as a skilled workman at a local workshop. He earns a good income from the business. His wife also helps with the work by selling milk from the cows. Now Ravshan wants to expand his livestock herd and his business so he is asking Arvand for a loan to buy cattle. Ravshan very much hopes for a good outcome and thanks Arvand for its support in advance.

an optimistic and hard-working woman, 31 years of age. SHe is married and has three children. She lives in a small rural village. As a child, Sanobar dreamt of becoming a schoolteacher, but her life circumstances were such that she was not able to receive higher education due to her family's financial hardship. Right after finishing secondary school, Sanobar was given away in marriage. And thus she became a homemaker. But even spending her days at home, Sanobar is never idle. She and her husband are doing everything within their power in order to provide their children with all necessity.\r\nIn order to have constant income to support their family, Sanobar and her husband launched their own business. They raise livestock. Sanobar raises livestock and then sells meat and milk. She receives a decent income. Sanobar's husband also works as a handyman in a local workshop, bringing in additional income to the family. Together they manage to earn an average-level income. So far they lack funds in order to provide for all family needs. \r\nAt present Sanobar and her husband would like to buy several more heads of livestock for raising. This is why Sanobar reached out to Arvand for a loan to buy livestock. Sanobar thanks Arvand in advance for its support which will help improve her family's quality of

The modern history of the Cham in Cambodia is marked by tragedy, as the genocidal Khmer Rouge prioritized the extermination of Muslims, Buddhists, and others of faith during their rule from 1975 to 1979.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1598061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To expand her grocery inventory by buying more grocery items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Phnom Penh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.55 104.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":61,"posted_date":"2014-05-05T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-04T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokiyas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24,"local_amount":24,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490874608},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504301716},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517584372},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530079807},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542560788},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561693516},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579625205},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595207742}],"funded_date":"2014-05-06T13:40:30Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T14:12:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Smit","image":null}},{"id":705608,"name":"Kheng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kheng (in the photo) lives on an island in the Mekong River about 15 kilometers from Phnom Penh.

46, married and has five children.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and is a responsible, goal-oriented and friendly woman.  She raises livestock and grows crops for a living, first setting up her farm in 1996 with 10,000 som.  Her family is very close, and her husband and children help her manage the farm.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, she currently has 3 dairy cows, 3 horses and 10 sheep on her farm, as well as a 3.15 hectare plot of land for growing potatoes, wheat, barley and sainfoin, and also makes money selling milk and dairy products.  Her farm brings in about 10,000 som per month, which helps pay for her family's food and other living expenses.  To further develop her farm, Zhyparkul is seeking a loan of 50,000 som from Bai-Tushum and Partners to buy premium-variety potato seeds and petroleum products for the spring planting season.  She plans on using any extra income due to the loan to further expand her farm and increase her harvests, and also hopes to set aside some money for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1590944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy potato seeds and petroleum products for the spring planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Novokonstantinovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:07Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhyparkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":555},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":554.69,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":30203.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":595436249},{"amount":91.27,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5033.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.23,"payment_id":610751262},{"amount":89.94,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5033.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.56,"payment_id":624798963},{"amount":86.78,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5033.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.72,"payment_id":636161114},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5033.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513526}],"funded_date":"2014-05-19T16:34:54Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":705620,"name":"Shamim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamim, aged 38, is a married woman.

She has two sons and three daughters. Four of her children are married and live in separate homes. And another one assists his parent in business. \r\nMary and her husband are fishermen and they sell fish that they catch in the local market. Some of her fishing nets are old and breaking down. She wants to buy new ones, it would be better for Mary to work. \r\nHence Mary decided to apply for a loan in order to purchase new fishing nets. \r\nMary is Cham Muslim.  The Cham are an ethnic minority in Cambodia, with a population estimated at 200,000 to 300,000 out of Cambodia's population of about 13 million people (2008).  The Cham have a proud past, with the Champa kingdom ruling much of what is present-day Vietnam from the 2nd century to 9th century. The modern history of the Cham in Cambodia is marked by tragedy, as the genocidal Khmer Rouge prioritized the extermination of Muslims, Buddhists, and others of faith during their rule from 1975 to 1979.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1598138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy new fishing net.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Phnom Penh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.55 104.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":61,"posted_date":"2014-05-05T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-04T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24,"local_amount":24,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490874617},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504301726},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517584382},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530079817},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542560797},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561693525},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-21T10:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579625213},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595207748},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610603185},{"amount":16,"local_amount":16,"processed_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624461215},{"amount":32,"local_amount":32,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637658711}],"funded_date":"2014-05-05T19:14:10Z","paid_date":"2015-04-23T11:12:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Montibello","image":null}},{"id":705630,"name":"Chheut","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chheut is 46 years old with five adult children, one of whom is already married.

They have requested a group loan of 120,000 YER and will hold each other accountable for the loan repayment.\r\nHyam is a very active woman from a poor family.   She is a 34 year-old married woman with three children. She is the leader of the group. Her husband was the sole breadwinner of the family. Recently, he became unable to take care of the family. Hyam decided to assume the responsibility of the family. She wants to provide her family with necessary needs.\r\nIn 2010, Hyam started her business as a door-to-door saleswoman selling women's and children's clothes for the local residents in her area.

Her oldest child is 14 years old and the youngest one is 9 years old. She is a hardworking woman who dreams of providing her children with a better future. Her husband was an employee and his salary was good enough to cover all the expenses of the family. Now, he is a pensioner, and he became unable to take care of his children. He was the sole breadwinner of the family. For this reason, Khadijah decided to assume the responsibility for the family. She started her business selling accessories, makeup, and cosmetics three years ago. \r\n\r\nKhadijah wants to enlarge her business, but she doesn't have enough money. As a result, she applied for a loan of 50,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more accessories and resell them to her customers. She looks forward to becoming a professional cosmetologist in the future. Her dream is opening a beauty salon. She hopes to provide her family with a lot of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n

","en":"Razia is 67, a widow, and the mother of three children. She has a higher education in pedagogy and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began four years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has one milking cow, one calf and 10 sheep, with a monthly income of about 15,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Razia has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase sheep for fattening and resale at the market for a higher price. She plans to use profits from the loan to further increase the size of her

They all have businesses in the food sector, such as selling vegetables, fruit, lunches and snacks.\nUrda (first from left) is 40 years old and married with one grown daughter. She is illiterate. Her husband helps support the family by working as a bus driver. Urda\u2019s business is selling snacks and lunches. She is very greatful to Namaste for teaching her how to run her business and how to grow it. With her daughter\u2019s help she now has good business records. From her Namaste business advisor she has learned how to control her expenses and improve the way she presents her products.  During the first business cycle she used part of her loan to acquire a new stove. This allowed her to increase her earnings just by adding the sale of tortillas.  \nWith her second cycle loan she wants to purchase products for her inventory that she now does not carry but for which there is demand. She also wants to continue improving the physical business environment, with the goal of eventually converting the space into a restaurant.  In this restaurant she would like to serve the favorite dishes of the people in her community.\nDuring the first cycle she increased her sales by 33% and she hopes for another 24% increase during this nine month cycle.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3750,"image":{"id":1596738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products for her inventory that she now does not carry but for which there is demand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Sumpango, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.646389 -90.733889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2014-05-05T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-04T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":3750,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urda Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dulce Celeste","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Crsitina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3222.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":416.67,"local_amount":3222.22,"processed_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3222.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835120},{"amount":416.67,"local_amount":3222.22,"processed_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3222.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504261240},{"amount":413.77,"local_amount":3199.82,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3199.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543540},{"amount":833.49,"local_amount":6445.62,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6445.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026844},{"amount":416.27,"local_amount":3219.17,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3219.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542519112},{"amount":416.96,"local_amount":3224.47,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561652792},{"amount":415.92,"local_amount":3216.43,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3216.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581607292},{"amount":418.72,"local_amount":3238.11,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3238.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595165307},{"amount":1.53,"local_amount":11.94,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":11.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610562078}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T16:34:28Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:51:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":705684,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a newly married tailor.

She lives in Churachandpur, one of the districts in Manipur, in the northeastern states of India.\r\n\r\nAs per Lalhlimpui, this would be the third loan taken from WSDS. With the help of the WSDS loan, her family\u2019s economic status has been improved tremendously, and she has gained so much for the smooth running of her business. \r\n\r\nPrior to availing the loan from WSDS, she earned income by usually engaging herself as a daily-wage laborer by weaving wraparound skirts for others. The amount she was paid to weave was very little. Therefore, it was very difficult to manage the household and children\u2019s expenses. However, after availing the loan from WSDS, she could afford to buy yarns and employ people for weaving, and also become a supplier to the distributors in the market.\r\n\r\nThe family cash flow has increased, and more household property has been added. Her husband also helps her in running the business. Lalhlimpui says that with the third loan, she wants to buy a weaving machine to replace hand weaving (traditional weaving), which will help in increasing the production and at the same time expand her business. \r\n\r\nShe also wishes to buy a plot of land and build a house for the family. She thanked WSDS for the constant support and financial assistance rendered to her and to her group members. Likewise, the rest of the group members are also in the weaving business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1598196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a weaving machine in order to generate more income and expand her weaving business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-05-05T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-04T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalhlimpui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rinliani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hauniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-08T04:43:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":705755,"name":"Samina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samina is a 32-year-old, married woman.

This will allow her to sell salchipapas (a popular fast food dish made up of sausages and French fries), and so make it easier for her to improve her sales and generate a better income for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1594019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a vending cart to sell sausages and French fries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Morrop\u00f3n - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2014-05-06T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-05T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":138.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":146.65},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":147.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":161.75},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":159.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":171.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":173.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":178.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":186.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":191.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":196.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":103.26,"local_amount":284.85,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T12:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":289.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490826759},{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":147.5,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":149.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504252447},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":149,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":151.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517535734},{"amount":58.63,"local_amount":161.75,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":164.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530018717},{"amount":455.63,"local_amount":1256.9,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1275.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542510474}],"funded_date":"2014-05-06T16:07:31Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T12:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Phipps","image":null}}]}
