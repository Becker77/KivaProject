For this reason he made the decision to take out a loan to prepare his house, so that his family will have a warm place to spend the winter.\r\n\r\nWilfredo dreams of having a good house where his family can live more stably and being able to give them everything that they need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1593988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy metal sheets, nails, and other materials to repair his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-06T03:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-05T03:50:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.01,"local_amount":41.01,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":41.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818259},{"amount":158.99,"local_amount":158.99,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":158.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243802}],"funded_date":"2014-05-09T23:51:27Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T11:21:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":702582,"name":"Khatichakhon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0445\u0442\u0430\u0440. \u0415\u0439 39 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0415\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0410 17-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d \u0438 15-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435. \u0425\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0438. \u0415\u0439 \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0436\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e. \u0425\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u044c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u044e\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0442.

one of the poorest district of India, stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their family with their contributions. They formed a group named Budhima to avail credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing businesses. \r\n\r\nHemakanti is standing in the middle with her hand raised in the photo. She is 44 years old and living with her husband and one son, 22, and two daughters (18 and 16 years of age) who help in her business. Hemakanti hails from a traditional cloth-weaving community. For the last 30 years, she has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. Now, she has two handlooms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader in a village 20 kms away.  80 to 100 pieces are prepared from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Hemakanti does the initial processing of the thread to make it ready for weaving and after that, her husband and son fit it to the handloom and weave saris. They only weave saris because of the demand in the market. Her family works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves one piece of sari from each handloom. Hemakanti sells her products to the local traders on a weekly basis. She earns a monthly income of Rs.6,000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. \r\n\r\nWith the present loan, she wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs for raw material. Hemakanti wishes to grow her business and save enough to complete the construction of her half-onstructed house.\r\n\r\nAmbika(s), Rukmani, Urmila, Chhabi and Ambika (G) are the five other members of the group. They have a cloth weaving business, a business making and selling sweet and salty items and a Tiffin Hotel business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1598381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase thread\/yarn in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-05-06T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-05T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rukmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemakanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambika (S)","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chhabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambika (G)","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-16T17:53:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":705922,"name":"Phea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phea is 41 years of age, married and is blessed with three children.

The lady standing with her hand raised in the photograph is Gunadei. She resides with her husband and two sons (9 & 6) years old. Her two children are studying in fourth and third standard in a private school. To increase the income of her family, in the year 2009, Gunadei, along with four other like minded women of her locality, formed a group named Jay Maa Mangala and has taken a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. This is the fourth loan for her.\r\n\r\nGunadei has been running a fancy store with ladies' fancy items and cosmetics in her house for the last eight years. She basically sells items like bangles, talc, combs, oil; face creams, plastic items, cosmetics etc. She started this business with a small investment of 5,000 INR of her own.money.  At that time, she was used to selling fancy items along with stationary items. Due to Good behavior and the politeness of Gunadei, her business was running well. Gunadei was very much interested in expanding her business, but a lack of finances was a hindrance for her. At that time, Mahashakti Foundation started its operation in that area and it was a blessing for her. Immediately, she motivated three other women, formed a group and took a loan for the expansion of her business. In the meantime, she has already taken four loans and fully repaid them with proper investment and development of her enterprise. \r\n\r\nNow, she has converted her business into fancy items and bangles. Presently, she earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR. This is not at all sufficient for her to manage the house and educate her children. She wants to increase the volume of her business to earn some extra income. So from the present loan of 40,000 INR, she has purchased a variety of bangles, fancy items and cosmetics from the nearest market in bulk. Gunadei is confident that this investment will give her more income. She hopes for the better education of her two sons and construction of a good house.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Janani, Mithila and Koushly who run a general store, noodle manufacturing and fish business, respectively.

He is a hard-working man aged 40, and is currently a single father. He has a young daughter aged 6. He had an unhappy relationship with his wife, and so they separated. His daughter lives with her and he only sees her at weekends. He makes the most of those days to share happy moments with his little girl. He is a builder by trade and he likes the pig-rearing industry, which is why he is requesting a loan to set up his own business.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, he hopes to increase his earnings to offer his daughter a better future, since because he can't be at home with her he will try to give her everything she needs growing up.

In the year 2013, six active women entrepreneurs of this village formed a group named Santoshi B to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing businesses. Santoshi is one of them. The lady standing second from right with raised hand in the photo is Santoshi. She is an energetic young lady of 27 years who lives with her husband, one son of three years, her father-in-law and mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nSantoshi has been running a rice huller and rice flakes-making machine in her village for 15 years. Her husband manages this unit. People from a five-mile radius come to this place for rice husking and rice flakes making. She earns a monthly net income of 8,000 INR from the existing businesses. Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. So Santoshi is planning to increase her income by expanding the business. Looking into the demand of the locality, from the present loan of 48,000 INR Santoshi wants to buy another rice huller to give better service to the customers. She is certain that this will generate a handsome income for her because in a radius of five miles this type of facility is not available.\r\n\r\nSantoshi hopes to save enough money to construct a good house and give better education to her son.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of the group, Kumudini, Bhabita, Maharagi, Umakanti and Supta, are doing a tent house business, a sweet making unit, a fruits stall, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1598396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing a rice huller.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-05-06T13:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-05T13:30:05Z","loan_amount":4350,"lender_count":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumudini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maharagi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Umakanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Supta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Santoshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":260000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":4350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":260000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-30T05:06:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":705862,"name":"Amber","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ever since she started walking, Amber loved to dance. At age 13, she started student teaching dance classes and at 15 she was already coaching competitive teams. Amber has taught all types of dance for over 18 years at studios throughout Southern California. \r\n\r\nFor many years, Amber drove by a beautiful ballroom studio and dreamed of someday owning it. She always wanted to start her own studio but it just never seemed like the right time. That all changed however, when she one day saw a \"for lease\" sign out in front of her dream studio. \r\n\r\nAmber and her husband, Rudolph, (pictured right) decided to take the plunge and signed the lease for the future home of The Movement Dance Studio. She already has a loyal following of students from the various classes she has taught around the city, and she hopes that her brand new state-of-the-art facility will attract even more high-caliber students. According to Amber, many of the top, reputable dance studios are in North County San Diego, and so she wants to offer the same caliber of training at a more central location. She also hopes that her studio's more central location will allow more low- to middle-income families to experience the joys of dance. \r\n\r\nThough everything is moving along smoothly, Amber is still in need of some start-up capital to launch her new studio. She will use her $7,500 Kiva loan to finish building out her studio and help pay for her first few months\u2019 rent. Hoping to provide a variety of creative options for her students, Amber needs a studio that can accommodate every type of dance from jazz and tap to ballet and hip-hop. \r\n\r\nAmber hopes to grow The Movement Dance Studio to at least 300 students over the next five years. Her fiery passion for dance drives her to push through the challenges of being an entrepreneur to spread her passion to others.

With this loan, Mrs. Bassitan hopes to earn an average monthly revenue of 125,000 West African francs, which will be used to reinvested in her business and provide for her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5925,"image":{"id":1598862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kalaban Coro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-05-06T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-05T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":201,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.15,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assara                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aya                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kiatou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bassitan  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":2800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":987.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":987.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":987.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":987.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":987.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":987.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":987.5,"local_amount":466666.67,"processed_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":466728.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961156},{"amount":987.5,"local_amount":466666.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":466728.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677498},{"amount":987.5,"local_amount":466666.67,"processed_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":466728.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677161},{"amount":987.5,"local_amount":466666.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":466728.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209825},{"amount":987.5,"local_amount":466666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":466728.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658672},{"amount":980.35,"local_amount":466666.65,"processed_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":466728.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.15,"payment_id":561792881}],"funded_date":"2014-05-22T18:28:02Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":703120,"name":"Andrea","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Andrea tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad y habita junto a sus dos hermanos de 60 y 64 a\u00f1os de edad en casa propia.

The salary that she receives from this business is very small .For this reason, Sada decided to start her own business in order to improve living conditions for the family. Four years ago, Sada started her own business selling makeup, accessories, and cosmetics. She wants to enlarge her business, but most of what she earns goes to the expenses of her children. For this reason, she applied for a loan of 40,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more incense, perfumes, and accessories and resell them.\r\n\r\nSada looks forward to enlarging her business through purchasing more cosmetics, accessories, and women's clothes. Also, she hopes to open a small shop selling chips, Sambusa, some kinds of drinks, and other kinds of food.

No one else lives with them. \r\n\r\nShe works in livestock, buying and selling them, and when business is not going well, she also works in agriculture. She has over 20 years of experience in this field. From a young age, her father taught her that one can only live a good life when you respect yourself and make yourself respected as the person you are. She milks two cows that produce curd and milk, making her daily sustenance more secure. The distance that she travels varies since she does not always go to the same place. When she harvests her crops, she sells part of it and keeps the other half for her own consumption. She works in the morning from 6am to noon. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to improve part of the floor in her house as it is currently a dirt floor, and she wants to lay a brick floor.

She had great success, even to the point of having her own business with 13 workers, but this ended due to an unfavorable period in which the clothing business suffered and many businesses closed because of the strong competition from foreign businesses, which sold their products much more cheaply, Lucia was left with the basic sewing, cutting and embroidering machines. With these, together with her husband, Oscar, and another employee, they now make clothing for third parties. It should be clarified that the holder of the account is Oscar, but due to his advanced age, Lucia is representing him. In spite of the fact that they are both older, they are not satisfied with their business: they want to expand it and make it more profitable. For this reason, they want to start their own line of clothing, starting with pajamas. Thus, they are requesting the loan to buy supplies such as fabric and remnants in order to make clothing. This will bring them excellent benefits, since they can sell these items to many customers they have gotten to know through their past experience. The principal dream of this beautiful pair of grandparents is to pass on a prosperous business to the next generation, with which they can feed their families and give them a good life. Both spouses, Lucia and Oscar, appear in the photo.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit.

She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Thanks to Baktygul\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes four dairy cows, five sheep, five goats and one horse. Her business brings in about 10,000 KGS from selling milk, dairy products, meat and livestock. This income serves  as a basis for covering the costs of food  and everyday needs for her family. In order to develop her business further, Baktygul turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 15,000 KGS to buy sheep. Baktygul plans to use the resulting income for an additional livestock increase. Also in the future she would like to pay for her son\u2019s wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1593040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Terek-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-06T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-05T22:10:06Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baktygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":16331.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513535}],"funded_date":"2014-05-07T01:29:49Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":706080,"name":"Denalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Denalyn, 33 years old, is married with seven children.

Every fifteen days, the members of the communal bank group \u201cMiraflores\u201d meets here. This place is known for its beautiful beaches and for its cuisine and for the warmth of its people.\r\n\r\nLucrecia lives in this place. She is 55 years old, married, and has 6 children who are of age and live independently. Her husband no longer works due to his age.\r\n\r\nLucrecia is a person who, during her whole life, has liked to make some of her own money. This is why, over 30 years ago, she started to stock a grocery store in her house. She started out with very little, but over time she has stocked her store very well. She sells a little of everything, from grains, detergents, lunch meats, vegetables, and meats, among other items of basic need, such as gift items, stationary, and certain medicines. She works with the help of her husband since he is retired. In this way she always earned her own income, with which she gave her children a good education. Now that they are professionals, the income allows her to get ahead in life, along with her husband.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to better stock her store. She will buy rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergents, lunch meats, and other products of basic need. She has been in the communal bank group for several years and she likes it because of the helpful loans. Her dream is to have good health.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1594350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Surya is a very active lady, but shy in nature.

Anyway, she was managing her family with this small amount. \r\n\r\nWhen her children started reading in school, she felt the need for money in the future for their education and development. She decided to expand her business. So, she motivated three other women from her locality and took a loan of 10,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation. She used this loan for purchasing daily use items like soap, biscuits, shampoo and food items. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this investment will generate more income and will help her to give better education to her children and build a house for her family. \r\n\r\nThe other three members are named Sabita, Laxmi and Satyabati and are also doing micro-enterprises like manufacturing of sweet and salty food items, fishing and fish selling."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1598241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase daily use items like soap, biscuits, shampoo and food items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BADI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-05-07T02:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-06T02:10:07Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Surya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-29T00:24:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":703321,"name":"Ever","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr Ever  es una persona muy responsable y dedicada a sus estudios y a su familia. \nEl est\u00e1 haciendo un doctorado en derecho, que le permitir\u00e1 poder incrementar sus conocimientos, de manera a seguir creciendo no solo como persona sino tambi\u00e9n como profesional.\nPide este pr\u00e9stamo para poder pagar sus cuotas del doctorado, ya que es un poco costoso y quiere poder cubrir ese trabajo.

way to make a living, Sambath is a 28-year-old mother of one dependent child. Rice farming, which she and her husband have been in for eight years, is the main source of her family\u2019s income. Her husband supplements the income by working for others for a fee.

Her husband is an active and cheerful farmer. They produce vegetables like eggplant, cauliflower, carrots, beans, chili, cucumber and papaya on their farm.  They sell their products to the traders of the nearest town who come to take vegetables from her farm.  But the profit they earn is insufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of their family as well as the farm expenses. Shilpi wants to expand her business by cultivating jute, but lacks the capital.  So she has taken a loan from BJS to buy fertilizers and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides. She expects a good return from her business by expanding her cultivation.
