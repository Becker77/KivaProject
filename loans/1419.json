She lives with her children and her husband, Bhisma, in Baroghoria in the district Jalpaiguri in their own kachha house (a house made of mud, bamboo and straw). She is a housewife and her husband is a farmer, engaged in land cultivation. They are uneducated and can sign their names only. But they are providing education to their children, two of whom are in school in grades 1 and 2. The third one is too young to go to school. They dream that their children get higher education.\r\n\r\nThey have chosen agribusiness because they have their own farmland. They grow various vegetables there such as eggplant, potatoes, bitter gourd, chilli, etc. They sell their produce in the local market. This business is the only source of income for the family, so they try their hardest to grow quality products in more quantity. \r\n\r\nNow they want to cultivate jute, which is a very profitable crop. They believe that farming in one's own land is more profitable than harvesting crops in someone else's land. The only hindrance is the lack of capital.\r\n\r\nKalpana has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase seeds, fertilizers and other agricultural inputs. She hopes with the profit from selling jute, they will be able to build a concrete house. She wants her children to lead a better and smoother life than they have now. She also hopes that her hard work will help her to make her dreams come true.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to BJS and Kiva for helping her financially.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1598804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase jute seeds and fertilizers for cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-05-07T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-06T13:50:04Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalpana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-07T20:54:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":706198,"name":"Manzoora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manzoora  is a 26-year-old married woman.

The group members work as vendors selling condiments (tomatoes), clothing and charcoal.

He did not have the opportunity to study, as his parents could not afford it, and the little he learned was with his brothers who did go to school. He lives with his mother, his son, and his nephew, who are all dependent on him.\r\n\r\nMiguel has worked in agriculture for about 15 years. His father taught him how to make a living. Miguel says his father would take him each time he did the the clearing of the land to prepare it for planting. This stuck with him, and his father told him in the future he would have to work to get his own food. This is the only income Miguel has. His nephew even helps to pull water when it's needed for planting corn, as he does the planting about 10 minutes walking distance from their home.\r\n\r\nMiguel is requesting a loan to purchase fertilizers he'll need in maize production. He hopes that, with a little compost and this loan, he'll have finished with all the fertilizers he'll need for the planting. He says getting this loan will make him happy, as he'll be able to harvest, and he wants to move forward to achieve his goals. \r\n \r\nHis goals and objectives are to have a good production this year, God willing, because he says that the house he lives in is very small and he wants to go continue saving with each harvest to achieve his end goal, to improve his house and thus have a better roof for his mother, son and nephew. Miguel is in charge of them and says he feels bad because he can not give them what they need.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1594926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer needed for maize production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-07T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-06T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Bennett","image":1377673}},{"id":706220,"name":"Unity Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustina belongs to Unity Group and lives in Dansoman.

He is determined to expand this sector, though his biggest challenge remains the lack of adequate funds. \r\n\r\nPeter is seeking a loan from KIVA through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow.

Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nWilliam is married and has six children. He is a carpenter while his wife is a farmer. She has been farming for 10 years now, and she is currently growing maize, beans, and oranges on their farm. William is excited about beekeeping as it will earn him some income.\r\n\r\nThis is William\u2019s first loan with Honey Care Africa, and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children.

beautiful children.  Her husband is currently working abroad, but the money he sends to his family is not enough to buy food, clothes, and to pay for the children's school fees.  This is the reason why Zulaiho is helping her husband: she sews traditional dresses for women from home, an activity which represents an additional source of income for her family.  Like other families who live in the countryside, Zulaiho and her family also own some cattle, which is yet another source of income.  Zulaiho would now like to buy an extra calf.  She is hoping that, thanks to this loan, she'll be in a better position to raise and educate her children.  She has turned to MDO Arvand for this loan and will use her money to buy a young calf.  Thanks to Kiva's support, this loan will ease her family's hardship."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1581584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-08T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-07T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulaiho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":241.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":249.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":257.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":275.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":285.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":294.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":304.79},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":315.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":325.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":336.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":346.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3567.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302942}],"funded_date":"2014-06-06T18:58:57Z","paid_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":706235,"name":"Bakary","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Bakary est un promoteur qui \u00e9volue dans la commercialisation des noix de cola.

She is married to a self-employed motor mechanic. Dissatisfied by her role as housewife, Ruth attended school of dressmaking, cutting and designing in 2009. In 2010, she started her sewing business operating from a room she was offered at her parents\u2019 house.\nRuth owns a domestic electrical sewing machine. She specialises in sewing seat covers and bed covers. Her main customers are cross border traders but she cannot meet all their needs due to working capital constraints.  She also loses a lot of time making frequent trips to go and buy materials as she cannot buy in bulk.\nRealising the need for training and cultivating a savings culture, Ruth formed Tiyamika group together with her friends from church.

His two daughters go to school - hey help their mother with the housework in the morning and then go to school in the afternoon.  No one else lives with them.  Edwin has a shop in the town centre but, at the moment, he does not have many goods and so would like to get a loan to stock it up. He has been running his shop for over 5 years, but his need to have provide income for his home led him to decide to take up farming as well.  he had no other business before and he runs his shop from his home and so he needs transport for getting around. His wife also serves in the shop which is open from 6am to 6pm. He would use the loan he is applying for to buy detergent, bread, coffee, rice, milk, beans, shampoo, etc. to extend his shop by buying more goods to sell. The loan will benefit him by enabling him to serve his customers better, as there are people who are looking for different goods which he does not currently stock. His dream is to keep on making progress through effort and hard work and trusting in God to give him health and life to carry on.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRosalina dreams to expand her business and have a bigger stock of grocery items. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Carlos has 31 years of experience making clothing, as he worked at a clothing company where he learned the trade. It gradually led him to become an independent dressmaker and he began to study to perfect his skills. \r\n\r\nHe sells for cash and for credit and works from Monday through Sunday.  He has business relationships with local schools, using his three sewing machines, and his main customers are the parents of the school children. He outsources some of the work such as embroidery and edging, but this adds to his production costs. It is for this reason that he is approaching Credikiva for his first loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. He will use the money to buy two machines - an embroiderer and an overlock sewing maching. \r\n\r\nThere is no end to his savings goals; he must generate enough income to cover his pension and this is his primary business goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1595126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an overlock sewing machine and an embroidery machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-05-08T13:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-07T13:50:07Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":69462},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72546},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74722},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76964},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":79273},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81651},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":84101},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":86624},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89222},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91899},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94656},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98880}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.47,"local_amount":69462,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70856.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490834339},{"amount":38.09,"local_amount":72546,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74002.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504260461},{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":74722,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":76222.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542746},{"amount":40.4,"local_amount":76964,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":78509.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530025991},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":79273,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80864.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518181},{"amount":42.43,"local_amount":81651,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83290.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":562430815},{"amount":39.24,"local_amount":84101,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85789.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.91,"payment_id":579566559},{"amount":213.35,"local_amount":461281,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":470541.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.82,"payment_id":595164070}],"funded_date":"2014-05-24T17:35:36Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":706555,"name":"Demalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Demalyn works hard to support her family.

It is their family business and they work together. \r\n\r\nNow Hotambek's family needs a loan. His nephew is in his third year at the medical college, but the family has not paid the tuition for this year. They need $1,200 USD and since they do not have the money, Hotambek is applying for a loan. His family has the motto \"all for one and one for all,\" so Hotambek is taking it upon himself to help pay for his nephew's tuition. He very much hopes for financial support.

He is married and his wife dedicates herself to household work.  They have three children who work in the capital.  Only two grandchildren and his wife live with him.  He works primarily growing basic grains such as corn and beans, but he also works planting and producing coffee.  For the past 14 years, he has produced coffee, and he has been growing corn for 20 years.  His parents were the ones who taught him this trade since they would take him to work from a young age.  At the moment, this is his only job. His coffee farm is 2 kilometers away, and he walks to work.  His daughters are the ones who purchase the agricultural supplies for him so that he can apply them to his bean, corn and coffee crops.  \r\n\r\nTeodoro states that with the loan he will repay part of a previous loan that he has with the institution, and the rest will be used to purchase 10 barrels of sulfate to fertilize his coffee.  The loan will allow him to purchase the supplies that he needs for his crops because without it, he would not be able to purchase them.  Teodoro's dreams are to repopulate his whole farm with coffee, to yield a good harvest, and to purchase a plot that is close to his farm to increase his production.  The loan will help him to expand his coffee crops.  With his earnings he will be able to continue to work.

Due to financial limitations, she was not able to continue attending school.  She is married, and her husband works with her in agriculture, growing basic grains.  They have two children.  The eldest graduated from high school and the youngest does not attend school.  Her husband, their two children and two grandchildren live with them.  Rosa works growing basic grains with her husband and son.  They have been farmers for 18 years.  Her parents also did not have another source of income besides agriculture.  She used to bring lunch to her father and would pay attention to the work that he was doing, which is how she learned the trade and since then, she has been devoted to this work.  The place where they work is 15 minutes away from their home, and they walk there.  She works with her husband and son who do the majority of the agricultural work.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase all of the supplies needed to plant the basic grains, which includes: three barrels of formula, four barrels of sulfate, insecticides and herbicides.  The loan will help them to purchase the necessary supplies since in the past, they have not been able to plant as much as they plan on planting now due to a lack of opportunity.  Rosa's dream is to have a good harvest and be able to sell it to earn an income that will allow her to continue working to provide her family with a better quality of life.  She also plans on repairing part of her home by changing the roof.
