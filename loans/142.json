The first one was affected by her husband's death, but was fully repaid anyway.\r\nShe intends to buy 10 baskets of dried fish in Korientz\u00e9 (Mopti Region), from Bozo and Somon\u00f4 fishermen. She sells it for cash or on credit at the fish market in Koutiala, to a clientele composed of women and men.\r\nShe intends to turn a monthly profit of XOF 90'000 (ca USD$ 180), to be used to repay the loan. The remainder will be invested into some family expenses. Her ambition is to diversify her business after her husband's death, to be able to correctly provide for her children's school expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":264191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy and resell dried fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safiatou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":40570.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135789},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":40570.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033590},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":40570.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620958},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":40570.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019923},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40570.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242668}],"funded_date":"2009-03-01T13:31:10Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":90914,"name":"Adiru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adiru V. is currently in the business of selling charcoal and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

She owns a business venture selling cooked foods.  Suria has 1 year of experience in this business.  Suria needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Suria joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Suria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Suria P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The couple has eight children between the ages of 14 and 31. \r\n\r\nNemesia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nemesia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, thereby uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP to buy fishing gear and equipment for the fishing boat. Nemesia hopes to continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. She is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

Development Units are groups of more than 10 people who have an account in the bank and meet every week or two weeks to make their payments.  They have a representative and a governing committee.  This group is located in the El Carmen community which is part of the municipality of San Miguel Soyaltepec in the state of Oaxaca.  The group is maD. up of ten people who have known each other for many years because they are neighbors in the community.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Judith D. T..  She is 25 years old, single and is studying Law.  She decided over five years ago to start her own roasted chicken and taco sales business because she wanted to pay for her studies.  She sells from her yard at home.  On Wednesdays and Sundays she sells chicken starting at two in the afternoon and on weekends (Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays) she sells tacos at night.  Judith needs this loan to buy chickens, a variety of chilies, charcoal, meat, spices, oil, tortillas, tomatoes, onions, disposables and beverages to prepare her food for subsequent sale.  She hopes this investment will produce good earnings to continue investing and be able to continue with her studies.\r\n\r\nNorma R. G. is part of the El Carmen group.  She is 37 years old and only went to elementary school.  She\u2019s married to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ruiz with whom she has four children.  One is a boy, David.  He\u2019s 16 years old and goes to high school.  The three girls are Jaquelin, 13, who is in middle school, Berenice, 11, who is in elementary school and the youngest, Mia, who is five and goes to the local preschool.\r\n\r\nFor the last two years Norma has had a grocery store in her home called Abarrotes Bere which is painted orange.  She decided to start her own business because she wanted to help her husband with household expenses and with the children\u2019s educational costs.   She needs this loan to buy rice, corn, beans, oil, soap and cheese to stock her little store.  She also told us that she\u2019s learning pastry making because in the future she\u2019d like to expand her business and also sell cakes.  Norma hopes to continue to invest her profits in her business and in her children\u2019s education since she\u2019d like proviD. them with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other eight members are:\r\n\r\nLucia C.

She earns her living by operating an abaca weaving business.  Her husband Joselito, who is 27 years old, works as a driver to earn his living.  They have four children who are 5 months to 7 years old. Gemmalyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemmalyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 to buy materials and abaca to weave so that she can continue to save up for future improvements for her business. Gemmalyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The group has 10 hardworking members who struggle each day to have a better life.  \r\n\r\nCarmelita P\u00e9rez Nicol\u00e1s, 36, is the representative of the group.  She is a single mother who is admirable because she has worked hard and fought to provide for her 3 children.  Her oldest daughter is studying at the university and the two younger children are in elementary school.  Carmelita has a store where she sells groceries and perfumes which is called \"URI-MAURI\" because her two small children are named Uriel and Mauricio.  She has had this store for 19 years, ever since the birth of her oldest daughter.  She started the business because she needed to support her small daughter.  She is requesting a loan to buy products such as: rice, sugar, coffee, soap and other items because recently her sales have been very low and she does not have enough money to stock her store.  She uses the earnings from the store to support her children.  \r\n\r\nAnother member of the group is Martha Norma V\u00e1zquez S., 35, who is married to  Antelmo Quiroz Quiroz, a farmer. They have 4 children: 2 girls and 2 boys aged 20, 17, 12 and 11.  Martha has a business making bread, which she sells door-to-door.  She has had good sales and good earnings, since she has the only business in the neighborhood that sells bread.  In addition, her bread is very delicious and she offers variety in her products.  She started this business because her husband's income was not sufficient to cover the family's expenses, and because they needed more money to pay for their children's education.  She comments that at the start she only made 50 loaves of bread, but over time she has been increasing her sales.  For this reason she is requesting a loan so that she can buy more supplies and make more bread.  Martha says that her goal is to eventually have a bakery in her town, so that she could provide employment for some people in her community.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are the following:\r\nClaudina C. R., 27, who sells plastic products.\r\nAmada Yudiht Hern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz, 40, who sells sweets. \r\nMartha Norma V\u00e1zquez S., 35, who makes bread to sell. \r\nJuanita Nicol\u00e1s S., 33, who has a grocery store.\r\nCita T.

Eliquia is 52 years old and only has an elementary school education.  She is married to Sr. Benicno, who works as a farmer.  Eliquia says that she and her husband live by themselves since their children are already married.  She lives in the community of Tetela, which is in the State of Oaxaca. This town is located in an area known for growing sugar cane and is 15 minutes away from the Don Pablo Machado sugar mill.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Eliquia says that she has always enjoyed working.  A few years ago, she attended a few courses that were taught in her community.  She learned how to make handicrafts such as embroidered shoes, blouses, handbags, dresses, and painted and embroidered napkins.  Since learning how to make these crafts, she decided to start selling them to her friends and neighbors in the community to earn extra money and help her husband with the household expenses.  Occasionally she produces some items from orders, but most of the products she makes are sold by going house-to-house in her community.  Eliquia says that she has done very well in her business.

He is a humble man who 6 years ago started a family with Erika, his wife. They have 2 children whom they are raising in their own home located in the community of San Juan. This hardworking farmer spends his time growing potatoes, peas and beans on his own land and on rented land. He rents more productive land sometimes for more production. What he likes the most about his job is being able to care for his crops trimming, fertilizer, and improving the quality of the food in the ripening process. He has 18 years experience in the farming profession and he feels very good about that. He also started a business buying and selling seeds. He takes them  to the city of Arequipa, where he makes good profit because that type of seed isn't produced in that area of the Peruvian coast. Now he is planning on improving the quality of his crops and growing his business, since that is what he likes the most. This is his eighth loan with MFP, where he hopes to have your cooperation to continue with his goals. He also promises to once more make his payments on time. Two years ago, Edgar bought his own house.

She plans to use this loan to buy fabric, cocoyams (taro) and Irish potatoes. She is very positive that her business will succeed because of her experience and better management skills. Furthermore, she sells to her customers at low prices and has good availability of products at all times to make sure the community has a regular supply of commodities.\r\n\r\n<p>She plans to use any profit made from this loan to pay her children's school fees, medication and house rent and to cater for other unforeseen circumstances in the family.

For the last two years he has worked raising sheep and cattle, and he says he enjoys his job because at a young age his parents taught him to love animals and the land. He will use the loan to purchase sheep because sales are the highest during the month of December because of the Christmas celebrations. He will also use the money to vaccinate his animals and to purchase animal feed. He is very pleased to receive this loan because it will allow him to sell more animals during the busiest season.

Sylivia is not part of the group photo but her small photo appears in the top left corner of the main picture and she is the person that was interviewed.\r\n\r\nN. Sylivia, a 35-year-old happily married mother of three, has been plying her retail shop business for the last four years in Wabigalo, Mityana. In a cutthroat competitive business like retail, one needs to conjure up ways and means and also one needs to strike a profound first impression with customers to get a niche in the market. Sylvia has used her good customer care skills as her business stock-in-trade.\r\n\r\nLong before Sylivia drew up plans of establishing this business, she was more inclined to a commercial agricultural business. In the course of time, she wanted to emulate the successful businesswomen her village had produced.

So to improve this condition, Samen is applying for a loan to buy a cow for breeding to start a new business.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":728462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":196900},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":31000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":333400,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":334233.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206092943},{"amount":64.33,"local_amount":257300,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-07T08:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":257943.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211163651},{"amount":49.22,"local_amount":196900,"processed_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-29T07:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":197392.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216446740},{"amount":11.48,"local_amount":45900,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-01T07:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":46014.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221611145},{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":166700,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T07:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":167116.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227505283},{"amount":95.3,"local_amount":381200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-01T08:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":382153,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232739994},{"amount":48.44,"local_amount":193800,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-30T08:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":194284.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239046781},{"amount":49.23,"local_amount":196900,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T08:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":197392.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244504390},{"amount":49.22,"local_amount":196900,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-01T08:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":197392.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250712098},{"amount":7.75,"local_amount":31000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-25T08:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":31077.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257115231}],"funded_date":"2011-04-01T13:46:42Z","paid_date":"2012-02-25T08:29:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":284353,"name":"Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas, de 33 a\u00f1os; es un hombre soltero y trabajador.

As his crops mature faster, he occasionally hires laborers to help him care for and harvest his products.

What differentiates Darlene\u2019s bag from others is its design. Divided into compartments that are stacked like shelves, it is ideal for storing books, electronics, clothes and more. Set on wheels, the bag is easy to transport.\r\n\r\nThe idea of creating an ultra-efficient luggage case came to Darlene when her daughter, a sophomore in college, complained of not having an efficient bag for carrying her belongings around campus. Soon after, Darlene came up with the bag\u2019s initial design as she was driving back from a conference in Mississippi. Now, nearly a year later, Darlene has a provisional patent and a prototype (see picture) that she is in the process of refining.\r\n\r\nDarlene has hired a product design firm to help her finalize the bag\u2019s layout and composition materials. A manufacturing company will make the bag, which she hopes will begin final production within the next three to six months. This loan helps Darlene finish refining the bag\u2019s design and allows her to manufacture samples that can be physically tested. The loan also provides her with the capital to manufacture a very small initial batch of the final product.\r\n\r\nDarlene is originally from New Orleans\u2019 Lower 9th Ward. She works nights as a bridge operator, which she likes because it frees her to work with her manufacturer and design consultant during business hours. Previously, she worked at a community health clinic for the city of New Orleans, but the clinic closed after Hurricane Katrina. She is a published author, having written <u>Spend Your Last Dollar: God\u2019s Plan of Salvation<\/u>, a book that draws lessons from the Bible and applies them to everyday life.

X., 29, is a member of a women's loan group where every one of the women weaves <i>huipiles<\/i>, the traditional Mayan women's top. In this village they weave the <i>huipil<\/i> of relatively simple cloth, but then embroider it richly.  Irma can make 2 <i>huipiles<\/i> in 15 days, and then she sells them in the market in Chimaltenango for about US$65 each.  She'll invest this loan, as she did the previous one, in the yarn she needs for weaving and in embroidery thread. She says that having a bit of capital via the loan just makes things a little easier \u2013 it's not a big problem trying to get money together to buy yarn, which used to be the case. In fact, she still has a little left from her last loan, which is completely paid off. \r\n<p>\r\nIrma's dream is to build a house and buy some land. She currently spends about $200\/year to rent a little 20 by 40 meter plot where she grows corn, the staple food of the people here. Buying a 20 by 20 meter plot would cost her about $2000. \r\n<p>\r\nIrma, like several other women in her village, reports that the children under age 2 are very regularly sick, with fevers, headaches, and stomach aches. It seems to clear up a bit when they get to age two, but it's a challenge that all the young families here seem to face.\r\n<p>\r\nHere is a video of the women of Irma's group at their loan meeting.

With all of their enthusiasm, Merta Nadi approached Denari to help them make raising pigs the right way easier.  Merta Nadi is asking for a loan to purchase high-quality pig feed, to help their sick pigs get well and to unsure that the control of their money is good in order.  After creation and training, Dinari now feels that the Merta Nadi group is ready to receive funding.  Merta Nadi consists of leader Ni Komang Santiani, secretary Ni Ketut Suari dan treasurer Ni Ketut Kongsi.  Merta Nadi has a total of 11 members.  The loan will be used to purchase a high quality boar and quality pig feed.  With these improvements the pigs they raise will be much higher quality than the pigs typically raised in their village.  All along, the members of Merta Nadi have been very diligent in their work.  With the help from the loan they receive the members of Merta Nadi believe that their business undertaking will be a success and really take off.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lender\/courtenaychris\">Courtenay Teska Race<\/a>, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMerta Nadi sebuah kelompok ternak Babi yang berlokasi di desa Candikusuma dimana sebagian besar masyarakatnya memeluk agama Hindu. Nama ini diberikan atas persetujuan anggota karena mempunyai arti bahwa Merta itu berarti Rejeki atau berkat sedangkan Nadi merupakan suatu jalan kehidupan. Sehingga Merta Nadi diberi arti oleh anggota kelompok kehidupan yang dipenuhi rejeki. Dengan keyakinan inilah anggota akhirnya mengajukan permohonan kepada Yayasan Dinari untuk mendapat pembinaan mengenai beternak babi seperti bagaimana cara beternak babi yang baik dan benar,cara pemberian pakan yang bagus, mengatasi penyakit babi secara cepat dan tepat,serta pengaturan keuangan yang benar agar modal untuk pakan ternak tidak habis untuk biaya dapur. Setelah pembinaan dan pelatihan dirasa cukup maka Yayasan Dinari memberi pinjaman modal kepada anggota kelompok Merta Nadi. Kelompok ini diketuai oleh Ni Komang Santiani ,Sekretaris Ni Ketut Suari dan Bendahara Ni Ketut Kongsi. Dengan jumlah anggota sebanyak 11 orang. Pinjaman modal yang diberikan oleh Yayasan Dinari dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit unggul dan pakan ternak  yang berkwalitas,maksudnya agar hasil yang diperoleh akan lebih bagus daripada memelihara babi lokal, yang selama ini mereka tekuni.\r\n\tDengan adanya pembinaan dan dukungan modal dari Yayasan Dinari maka kelompok Merta Nadi berkeyakinan bahwa usahanya akan sukses dan berkembang bagus."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":131916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been able to join with her husband to buy several plots of land for farming, build a small house, and make plans to complete a larger one that can accommodate everyone. \r\n<p>\r\nChristine says her business is doing well -- recently the lake was not in a good condition, but thank God it is now in great shape and everyone is happy. Christine dreams of one day opening up a retail shop that will sell cold drinks, soaps and cereals so that she can work in one place as she grows older and her legs become more painful. She is thankful for her husband's help in raising their children and helping them become educated. She will use her potion of the loan to buy more fishing nets to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":205950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more nets to sell to local fisherman.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Nkokonjeru","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 32.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-10-09T21:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaituni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Konorio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lozio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-24T05:11:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1475000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1475000},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1475000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1475000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":1475000,"processed_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1482300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5344368},{"amount":900,"local_amount":1475000,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1482300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966482},{"amount":900,"local_amount":1475000,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1482300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14882679},{"amount":900,"local_amount":1475000,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1482300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20432213}],"funded_date":"2008-10-10T05:11:00Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:45:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":70466,"name":"Mrs. Ro Sarim Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group leader of five is Mrs. Ro S., age 28, and all of the members live in Thmey Khmer Village in Kampong Chhnang Province.

Luis works in a shoe factory, and beyond his base salary, he may buy his merchandise at a low cost and then obtain earnings from his own sales. The trips that he makes are on the weekends. Travelling and selling are activities that keep him entertained and relax him. His earnings motivate him to continue working, but his greatest yearing that he wants to fulfill is to have his own shoe factory and to produce his own designs. This is the first time that he is asking for a loan with MFP. He wants to forge a  working relationship in his comunal bank, and be punctual in his payments. The money that he is asking for will be to stock up on the highest quantity of merchandise.

She sells jewelry which she buys, most of the time, at the commercial district in Santo Domingo, the capital city. She will use this loan to buy a large inventory, expecting her jewelry sales to pick up with Mother's Day coming up on May 31st.\r\n\r\nRafaela has not always sold clothes. She once had a chemical products manufacturing business. She used to make cleaning products and personal care products like shampoo and soap. Rafaela hopes to invest her jewelry profits into setting up her chemical factory again. She would like to be admired in her community as a hard-working woman full of creativity and always looking to grow as a person.\r\n\r\nPleas help us support this group with this Kiva loan.

Aunque parece que para Maggi eso es hoy parte de la historia, porque ella no quiere regresar a Casacar\u00e1, como han hecho muchos de sus habitantes apoyados por el estado para su retorno;dice  que con sus negocios, ella y su mam\u00e0 han logrado salir adelante, ayudar a su hermano menor y apoyar el ingreso de su padre al hogar, lo cual le ha proporcionado cierta estabilidad.\nMaggi, al mismo tiempo que trabaja siempre ha estudiado y desde el nivel de educaci\u00f2n secundaria se ha enfocado en la pedagogia; actualmente estudia licenciatura en eduaci\u00f2n b\u00e0sica en la Universidad del Atl\u00e0ntico; ella est\u00e0 en la busqueda de ganarse un escalafon en el sistema Educativo formal y por eso dia a dia se esfuerza por estudiar, asi como lo hizo cuando con su mami a clases, preparandose juntas para tener herramientas pedagogicas aplicables a su trabajo en el colegio; permitiendole a su madre cuidarla de cerca pues termin\u00f2 el bachillerato a los 15 a\u00f1os. \nMaggi es una joven polifac\u00e8tica le encanta el arte de fotografiar, por eso en su local adem\u00e0s de hacer fotomontajes, fotos para documentos y de tipo social, por ejemplo fotografias de bautizos, cumplea\u00f1os primeras comuniones etc. ayuda a la gente a acceder a la tencologia de internet y a hacer trasncripciones para presenter curriculos de trabajo, o para averiguar informaci\u00f2n de algun programa al que estan aplicando,  ya que en  esta comunidad  no es muy usual que la gente conozca el manejo de las herramientas de informatica y mucho menos tenga una red de internet personal a su disposicion y es menos comun saber acceder a ella. \nEl negocio principal de Maggi es una sala de internet, donde ademas presta el servicio de fotocopiado, fotografia, fotomontaje, colajes para los ni\u00f1os, redacciones y transcripciones. Ella es una joven ejemplar, por su gran sentido de responsabilidad, su capacidad de trabajar y estudiar desarrollada desde muy ni\u00f1a  y su disposicion para acceder a los servicios que fortalecen su crecimiento personal y empresarial; asi fu\u00e8 cuando le recomendaron ir a la Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo para obtener un cr\u00e8dito que incrementara su capital de trabajo y para recibir asesor\u00eca para formalizar su peque\u00f1o negocio a lo que ella inmediatamente accedi\u00f2 y en la actualidad su asesor Milgen Sanchez la est\u00e0 asesorando en este tr\u00e0mite .\nCon el actual y su primer credito por valor de $1.500.000, Maggi planea ampliar su negocio adecuando su sala de internet para tomar fotografias, hacer pendones publicitarios, con el fin de ser mas conocida por otras comunidades  cercanas. Ella considera que su negocio es muy estable, no tiene competencia en el barrio, por eso sus clientes muchas veces esperan en su puerta hasta que otro termine de acceder al servicio por el que vino al negocio.\nSu principal desafio que es el de todos en la familia, trabajar intensamente para apoyar el tratamiento de su padre que sufrio un Accidente de trabajo y su programa de salud no alcanza a cubrir los medicamentos  que requiere para superar la situaci\u00f2n. De igual manera sue\u00f1a con ayudar a su hermano a que desarrolle sus potencialidades y estudie en la universidad la carrera que le guste; mientras tanto ella sue\u00f1a con subir de escalafon  en el sistema educativo y legalizar el colegio de su madre\nMaggi  y su mama, describen su barrio, Nuevo Milenio, como una comunidad donde la mayoria son  desplazados, pero muy por encima de eso son gente solidaria y trabajadora; explica  que tuvieron que organizarse para que sus calles pasaran de ser un basurero a lo que es h\u00f2y,  ya que fu\u00e8 producto de una invasion que el estado esta legalizando; sostiene que entre todos han contribuido a poner servicios publicos comunitarios  y  que a trav\u00e8s de su negocio contribuye a llevar tecnologia a los hogares mas pobres, pues son muchos, los que aun no tienen posibilidades de acceder a la redes de Internet y de conocer el manejo de la informatica.\n","en":"\r\nMaggi Isabel B. is 20.  She arrived from Casacar\u00e1 in the Cesar department with her parents and brother about 15 years ago.  Ever since she was a little girl necessity make her think of generating income.  She could not continue living in the town where she was born because of the fear of some of its inhabitants.  This caused her to abandon the place where she was born and go to Soledad.  There she found international institutions that encouraged her to study by giving her school supplies and a book of stories.  At that time her mother supported the literacy campaigns, and she helped women in the care and completion of the academic activities of their children.  She did this with Maggi\u2019s help to generate some income.  This was the start of a small school, which was part of her mother\u2019s adjustment to the Nuevo Milenio neighborhood in the municipality of Soledad.  Maggi also worked there part time; she is a very productive young woman.\r\n\r\nMaggi has her own business, which she started with the help of a government program.  She started with a computer, which she learned to operate.  Then she got a loan with the same entity to buy other equipment and access the Internet.  Then she gradually added a photocopier, a developing machine, and a photography machine.  At first she used a computer and a lot of books to offer librarian services from her house to neighborhood students.  Most of the neighbors are displaced due to the armed conflict, just like her family.  Although it may appear to be part of the story, Maggi does not want to return to Casacar\u00e1 like many people, who are supported by the state, have done.  She says that with their businesses she and her mother have gotten ahead, helped her younger brother, and helped with the income her father brings home.  This has given them some stability.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Maggi has worked she has always gone to school.  She has been focusing on pedagogy since high school.  She is currently studying for her degree in basic education from the Atlantic University.  She is looking to win a place in the formal education system.  Therefore, she studies hard everyday, just like she did with her mother.  They prepared themselves together to have the pedagogy tools that applied to their work in the school.  This allowed her mother to be close and take care of her.  Magi got her high school degree at 15.  \r\n\r\nMaggi is a multi-faceted young woman.  She loves the art of photography.  At her place she does more than photo montages, photos for documents, and social photos.  For example, she does baptism photos, birthdays, and communions, etc.  She helps people access the technology of the internet, make job resumes, or to find information about a program they are using.  It is unusual in this community for the people to know how to use information tools, and even less common for them to have the use of the internet at their disposal.  It is less likely that they know how to access the internet.\r\n\r\nMaggi\u2019s main business is a large internet caf\u00e9, where she also offers photocopy, photography, photo montage, collages for children, editing, and transcription services.  She is an exemplary young woman because of her great sense of responsibility, her work capacity, her studies since childhood, and her aptitude for accessing the services that strengthen her personal and business growth.  That is how it was when they recommended that she go to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to get a loan to increase her working capital and to get an advisor to formalize her small business.  She immediately got a counselor, Milgen Sanchez, who is currently advising her in this procedure.\r\n\r\nMaggi plans to expand her business using her current first loan for 1,500,000 COP.   She will equip her internet caf\u00e9 with the ability to take photos and make publicity banners.  She will do this to become better known in nearby communities.  She considers her business to be very stable.  She does not have competition in the neighborhood, and many times her neighbors wait at her door for their turn to get the services they wish to access.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge is the same as with all families.  She works intensely to support her father\u2019s treatment.  He suffered a work accident, and his health program does not cover the medications he needs to overcome the situation.  She also dreams of helping her brother develop his potential and study for a career he would like in the university.  Meanwhile, she dreams of climbing the ladder in the educational system and legalizing her mother\u2019s school. \r\n\r\nMaggi and her mother describe their neighborhood, Nuevo Milenio, as a community where most are displaced.  But, underneath it all, they are united and hard-working people.  She explains that they had to organize themselves so that their streets would stop being a garbage dump into what it is now.  It was a product of an invasion that the state is legalizing.  Everyone has contributed to establishing community public services.  Through her business she is contributing to bringing technology to the poorest homes.  There are a lot of people who still cannot access the internet and do not know how to work with computers.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":481637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Equip her photographic space and invest in publicity, especially banners that she designs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-04T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maggi Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109233},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113592},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115958},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118374},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120840},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123358},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125928},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128551},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131229},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133963},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136754},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":115.13,"local_amount":222825,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":227949.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949031},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":115958,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":118625.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677821},{"amount":61.16,"local_amount":118374,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":121096.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712195},{"amount":62.43,"local_amount":120840,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":123619.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636024},{"amount":63.74,"local_amount":123358,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":126195.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850125},{"amount":65.06,"local_amount":125928,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":128824.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116894},{"amount":66.42,"local_amount":128551,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":131507.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410758},{"amount":137.02,"local_amount":265192,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":271291.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550416},{"amount":70.65,"local_amount":136754,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":139899.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427268},{"amount":73.48,"local_amount":142220,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":145491.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000686}],"funded_date":"2010-02-05T14:53:23Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":177496,"name":"Ku\u00f1a Katupyry Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo del Barrio San Pedro viviendas surgi\u00f3 por promociones realizadas en la zona.

She is 20 years old and single. To make a living, Paz owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling cell phone electronic loads in different networks and also selling cellphone accessories in the local community. Paz has been engaged in her business for over 1 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Paz joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Paz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Paz is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Paz from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

she says, \u201cproviding young parents with affordable and reliable daycare services is the only way to put Texas back to work.\u201d She started Kingdom Kidz because she saw a need in her Katy, Texas community for young, working parents to have access to reasonably priced daycare services. Without this access, she says these parents could not afford to go to work each day.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Kingdom Kidz special doesn\u2019t end there, however, because walking into the Kingdom Kidz is less like walking into a playpen and more like walking into a school. Aliceson splits the children\u2019s time into activity time, during which students are able to play and interact freely with each other, and what she calls curriculum time. During curriculum time, the young students work with math, reading and computer literacy tasks. \u201cI have a big, loving heart, but I also have very high expectations for education,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nAliceson feels that her biggest business success to date has been seeing children as young as one beginning to read. Though Aliceson has seen impressive success with her current location, she hopes to extend her reach by opening multiple locations that provide the same excellent service as her current center. \u201cMy goal is to see an excellent academic rate, with the children under my care more than ready for elementary school when they leave my center.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlong the impressive results her program produces, Aliceson attributes her business success to the joy she brings to her children. She says that one of the biggest challenges in her business is becoming a household name that parents can trust. She built this trust by creating a comfortable and stimulating environment for her children \u2013 one which they are sometimes reluctant to leave. \u201cBy the end of the day, the children don\u2019t want to go home, and they are excited to come back the next morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Aliceson will build an even stronger learning environment for her young students. She will purchase arts and crafts supplies, a laminator, a computer (with which children can learn basic computer skills), and blocks. With the remainder of the loan, she says she will buy things she can utilize to make her curriculum better, such as printers and planning documents.\r\n\r\nWithout this loan, Aliceson would not be able to obtain the resources necessary to reach the high expectations she holds for her children\u2019s education. She reached out to the Kiva partner Accion Texas-Louisiana after being denied a loan at a commercial bank. Not only will this loan allow Aliceson to continue her mission of putting Texas back to work, it will help her to continue building a bright future for the children under her care and for her community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":803748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

What he likes about his work is that he is on his own time, and also that he always has customers, since he is super careful when it comes to transporting merchandise. He hopes to keep on the way he has been up to now, since he has a lot of work and for the time being is not able to demand much mO. of himself. \r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP. He is happy with the group he belongs to and hopes to continue receiving mO. loans from the institution. Thanks to the disbursements he has received he bought a vehicle, since befO. he was working by tricycle. With the 1,000 soles he has requested he will make payments on his motorcycle, as well as some technical adjustments to it.

She would like to have a larger space for her business so she can set up a cafeteria, and maybe make some sandwiches to sell with her orange juice at breakfast time!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please help us support Robertina and her group through this Kiva microloan.

Muhamadjon is 23 years old. He has been running his business for about two years. He rents a retail store where he sells different kinds of housewares. His business is his main source of income.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

La mayor\u00eda de este grupo se dedica a lo que es la venta de ropa (toallas, colchas, poleras, pantalones para damas, varones, y ni\u00f1os), porque en la localidad es una zona de mucho movimiento econ\u00f3mico (es sobre la carretera principal) y es lo que las socias aprovechan para hacer sus ventas.

The members are known for being very united, as they belong to the only labor union in their town, and are very hard-working, punctual and responsible with their obligations. The majority of the members make a living selling clothes and other items (T-shirts, pants for men, women and children; towels, bedspreads). Their area is known for its busy economic activity since it is on the main highway, and the members take advantage with their sales. Because of the economic activity there is  enormous business potential and the amount of competition is average, but with the growth in population in the area there will be a growth in demand. The market is not fully utilized, and in a small space a lot of different types of businesses can be found. This loan will be directly used to invest in all the merchandise the members bring in from the main cities, and thus they will be able to grow their businesses. As for the members' experience with the process, the vast majority of them have participated in loan programs from other financial institutions that did not require large guarantees and have demonstrated punctuality with their payments. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

He is married with 8 children between the ages of 11 and 29. Six of his children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nHe is a farmer from the town of Litein in Rift Valley, Kenya. He has been practising mixed farming for 33 years and has employed five people from his community. His main produce is tea, pineapples, and milk which he sells to the local market. He also earns income from his rental shops and houses in the same area.\r\n\r\nHis major challenge has been lack of tapped water and this has made it hard for his dairy herd since the cows have to go to the river to take water.\r\n\r\nJoseph has requested this second loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 80,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to purchase a dairy cow and expand his farm under animal feed. He says that this loan will bring in more income for the family through the sale of milk and thus improve the living standards of the family and ease payment of school fees.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to increase efficiency in his farm by owning machines like chaff cutters for animal feed and purchase a vehicle to aid in the transportation of his products to the market. He is also grateful to Juhudi for making available loan facilities for farmers like himself."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":568399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a dairy cow and expand his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T14:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159661086},{"amount":170,"local_amount":13600,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13902.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142399},{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437230},{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576585},{"amount":85,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6951.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712340},{"amount":170,"local_amount":13600,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13902.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872224},{"amount":70,"local_amount":5600.03,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5724.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030093},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":6666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668167},{"amount":42.92,"local_amount":3433.3,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3509.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446716},{"amount":123.75,"local_amount":9900,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":10120.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535663}],"funded_date":"2010-07-15T21:46:37Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:24:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":218818,"name":"Noeu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Noeu T., aged 55, is a widow with five children \u2013 three sons and two daughters.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is a responsible single mother with 4 children.  She lives with three of her children: 17 year-old Yerson, 13 year-old Gina and 8 year-old Kelly.  They live in their own home in Playa Hermosa-San Ram\u00f3n (in the Peruvian central jungle).\r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman is a farmer.  Her main crops are pineapples and a range of citrus fruits.  She has 15 years' experience and she says that this helps her to sell her products in the market in the capital where good-quality and well-priced products sell the best.\r\n\r\nOnce a year, Aurora harvests her fruit on a grand scale whilst her pineapples are harvested every week.  This means that she constantly has to travel to the capital.  However, the tenacity that characterizes Aurora means that she invests in improving her crops.  She is currently starting with constant, staggered applications of manure.  With this, she is certain that she will produce similar fruit of the same quality and, above all, fruit that is very nutritious.\r\n\r\nThis is Aurora's sixth loan with MFP and she hopes to continue working with the members of her community bank who are serious and very responsible people.  She is planning to use her loan to buy several sacks of organic manure for her crops.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":671619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of organic manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-20T19:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":843.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349929}],"funded_date":"2010-12-20T19:52:52Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":263895,"name":"Sam-Ol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sam-ol T.

At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nClarissa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 450 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nClarissa dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":874841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-21T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clarissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":3999.99,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4127.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764654},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6667.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6879.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571775},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5332.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5503.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529325},{"amount":95,"local_amount":4000.04,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4127.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738542}],"funded_date":"2011-09-22T23:41:52Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":341776,"name":"Stella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stella is a forty-six-year-old married woman with four children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She has been married for almost thirty years now. She has been supporting herself and her children too. Currently two of her children are in school, while the rest are fully independent. She has a mini shop where she sells items like bags of rice, sugar, flour etc. She also bakes bread to supply the area where she lives. Others also come to her house to buy them.  <p>\r\nWith the slow pace of the business, she has opened a grocery shop just in front of her house and sells items like milk, sugar, tinned tomatoes, flour etc; but, the unfortunate thing is that she has insufficient working capital to run the business. With the loan, she wants to inject more working capital into the business to scale up business progress.

At the moment, she and her husband live in the house of her in-laws.  \r\n<p>\r\nThroughout her life, Norma has been involved in growing bananas and citrus fruits.  However, the income from these crops does not exceed the profits that can be made from coffee.  For this reason, she decided to rent a field of rich farmland in an area known for its pristine coffee plantations.  Norma feels very lucky to live in the central Peruvian jungle where the soil is fertile.  While she waits 2 to 3 years for her coffee crop to mature, she continues to cultivate bananas and citrus fruits because it provides a stable income for her household.  Norma and her husband are very happy with their plantings and look forward to generating good earnings so that they can buy their own farmland.  They are currently using her father-in-law\u2019s field.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Norma\u2019s second loan with MFP.   The payments from her previous loan were made on time.  She is very happy to be part of her Communal Bank.

The ladies' businesses are related to commerce, production and services.

She is married and has four children.\r\n\r\nMore than ten years ago, some friends taught L\u00eddia to sell 'tunta' and, seeing that it was a business that made good profits, she decided to keep it going.

These are metropolitan municipalities in Bararnquilla.\r\n\r\nIn her business she has an average profit margin of no less than 40%.  She makes 40% of her sales for cash and 60% on credit.  She recovers her expenditures every eight days.\r\n\r\nShe buys wholesale, and she works in the afternoon Monday through Sunday.  On the average she works six hours a day.  Her greatest strength in the business is her capacity to work.  Her great opportunity is the absence of competition.  There are no businesses like hers in her target market around her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is obtaining enough working capital to satisfy the growing demand of her customers.  They want competitive prices like those that she offers by making her purchases in volume.\r\n\r\nThis is her first Kiva loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will buy a shampoo chair and dryer chairs.  This way she is generating a more comfortable, elegent, and attractive atmosphere each day.

Thanks to her children who help her with the business, she's able to live happily at home.  Thanks to the opportunities that she's been smart enough to take advantage of over the course of her life, Herminia has been able to educate her children who, in turn, established a shop for their mother so that she would be able to work and not feel isolated, something that depresses most people.  That's how, for 4 years, she's worked tending her grocery, each day, from seven in the morning until nine at night except those days when she closes to sell food.  There's a lot of demand for her meals some evenings and cooking is one of the jobs that she most enjoys.  Herminia would like to continue working in order to cover her everyday needs since \"no lo agrada recibir, sino adquirir\" [you're not grateful for what you receive, only what you buy]; this idea has led her to strive to grow her business and set up a space for bookshop.  Working with a group has opened the way to friendships and help for her business and the payment meetings and other events are reasons for continuing to belong to PRISMA, but this will be Herminia's first individual loan.  She will use the 3000-soles loan to buy large quantities of merchandise, things for students and beauty product, for example, to stock her shop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":297255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Supply general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-03T19:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":197.4},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":209.37},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":214.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":226.31},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":232.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":239.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":256.52},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":262.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":273.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":285.94},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":297.37},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":304.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.84},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":197.4,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":199.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012361},{"amount":66.3,"local_amount":209.37,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":211.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595949},{"amount":67.84,"local_amount":214.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":216.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990213},{"amount":77.77,"local_amount":245.6,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":247.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211338},{"amount":70.19,"local_amount":221.64,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":223.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640852},{"amount":176.09,"local_amount":556.08,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":560.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080321},{"amount":89.84,"local_amount":283.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":286.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996522},{"amount":339.47,"local_amount":1071.98,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1081.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733775}],"funded_date":"2009-04-16T19:02:42Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":103282,"name":"Ma.
