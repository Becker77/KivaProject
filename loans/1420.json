Meet Helen. Helen is a Finance Officer at Juhudi Kilimo\u2019s headquarters in Nairobi.\r\n\r\nShe is a 30-year-old self-driven lady from Cheptinet which is a rural village on the base of the Great Rift Valley which runs through Kenya from Tanzania to Ethiopia. \r\n\r\nHelen is planning to enroll in Egerton University which is the oldest institution of higher learning in Kenya. She received the letter of acceptance from the university for a Bachelor of Commerce degree course. She is very excited about the opportunity.\r\n\r\nImmediately after graduating from high school, Helen joined K-REP bank as a Clerk. Shortly afterwards, she was made an Accounts Assistant at K-rep Development Agency, a subsidiary of K-rep Bank which later  became Juhudi Kilimo.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy strong conviction has always been to offer my acquired professional and technical skills to impact the society. At Juhudi Kilimo, I have found the opportunity to do so. We tackle poverty by empowering farmers to become agribusiness entrepreneurs by shifting from subsistence farming.\u201d \r\n\r\nHelen seeks an educational loan to advance her knowledge and skills. She has the capacity to take on bigger challenges that come with the super-growing microfinance industry in Kenya and its ever-changing environment. \r\n\r\nHelen is the sole breadwinner in her family. Her five siblings are dependent on her contribution towards their educational fees. To Helen, the cost of going to a quality university like Egerton is quite prohibitive. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Helen is going to deliver the promise of elevating the quality of life made to smallholder rural farmers in Kenya. \u201cJuhudi is undergoing a radical transformation. As part of the Finance team, I look forward to applying the newly acquired skills and knowledge into my role. Juhudi is at the point it requires strong leadership and strategic thinking to be able to deliver on our promises to farmers.\u201d \r\n\r\nHelen is comfortable with the repayment period and the monthly repayments: She is confident the repayments will be made on time throughout the loan cycle. The classes are scheduled in the evening so that her work at Juhudi Kilimo remains uninterrupted.  \r\n\r\nI hope you will invest in Helen\u2019s future. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Litein, Kenya. He has been a farmer for the last 16 years. He makes ends meet selling milk, eggs, and tea produced on his farm. His hobby is milking \u2018Milo\u2019 (the name of his dairy cow). However, drought in the region usually leads farmers to take losses due to crop failure. Currently, Duncan can barely meet his family expenses. \r\n\r\nDuncan is seeking a loan to construct a cowshed. This structure will enable his dairy animals to have access to clean drinking water. Cows need water to produce milk since water makes up 80% of milk.

Kenya popular for tea and banana plantations. He sells eggs and tea from his farm into the local village markets. He also engages in small seasonal businesses to make extra money. He is very appreciative of the fact that farming is profitable. However, raising more capital to expand his operations to meet the demand is quite challenging. \r\n\r\nMoses is seeking a loan to purchase a motorcycle that will help him ferry his produce to the market. Currently, his highest monthly expense is transportation. The motorcycle will not only reduce this cost significantly, but also act as an additional source of income because he is going to offer transportation services to other farmers in the area at a much cheaper rate. Your loan will help Moses\u2019 family get more income and improve their quality of life.

Her daughter is just one year old. Arzak is the leader of the group. She has started her business of selling women's clothes door-to-door for three years. She started her business with a small capital. The beginning was by taking a loan from AMB. She thanks the AMB leader for her first loan. \r\n\r\nYear by year, Arzak's business improves more, but most of what she earns goes to the expenses of the family. She has good experience in this business. Thanks to her experience, she deals with her business easily. Unfortunately, the income of this business is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family, and she wants to improve it. For this reason, she applied for another loan of 60,000 YER from AMB to purchase more women's clothes and resell them to her customers. Arzak looks forward to expanding her business more and hopes to renovate her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1599581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase more women's clothes and resell them to her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Aden","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-05-08T20:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-07T20:50:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashwak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fozya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ward","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arzak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15099},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14989},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":14989}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.46,"local_amount":15099,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15142.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490734577},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504162292},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517446075},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529930004},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542422352},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561559977},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579469041},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595075880},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610478414},{"amount":69.94,"local_amount":14989,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15031.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624780933}],"funded_date":"2014-05-17T23:29:50Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:28:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Dietz","image":1476253}},{"id":706707,"name":"Kabibi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kabibi is a widowed woman who has been blessed with seven children.

Her biggest challenge is generating income.\r\nJane is seeking a loan to purchase a water tank. This will help in her efforts to introduce a zero-grazing model of farming. \"The cows will save the energy that gets used up looking for pasture and drinking water,\" she said.

She learned the work from her parents, who have always been farmers and with that have been able to work hard and get ahead. Blanca says that she too saw the need to start working in agriculture, and with what she plans she has been able to help her children get ahead in life. She doesn't have any other economic activities. The land she works is beside her house, and she and her partner wake up at 5am to start their workday, then work until 11am. \r\n\r\nBlanca is requesting a loan from CrediCampo to buy fertilizers to treat the land that they are going to plant this year. With this loan, she will be better off, since they are currently worried about not having the money to buy fertilizers, and right now prices are good so she wants to take advantage of the opportunity to buy so that they can be ready to start cultivating. \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to always be in good health so that she can help her partner plant, because she knows that this is how they make a living.

Meet Peninah, a mother of five from Nyamira in rural Kenya. Peninah has been involved in farming for 10 years! Her primary income sources are tea, bananas and other personal businesses.\r\n\r\nFrom her experience, dairy farming is not only profitable but also enjoyable: All the animals on her farm are referred to by names. The challenge, however, is that growth is constrained by limited funds\/capital. \r\n\r\nPeninah is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. She has been keeping poultry for fun for many years. Recently, however, she was taught how poultry is a big business if made commercial. She feared the high costs involved in setting up a commercial poultry farm at first, but after looking at the projections, she sees the point.\r\n \r\nInvest in Peninah's future. The income she will generate from her poultry farm alone is enough to facilitate timely loan repayments and savings. The loan will help Peninah\u2019s family improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1599652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-05-08T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-07T21:50:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2418.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3003.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3051.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3133.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3242.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3305.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3413.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3486.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3580.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3706.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3776.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3881.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.08,"local_amount":9859.47,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10197.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287521},{"amount":27.9,"local_amount":2349.82,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2430.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054227},{"amount":37.46,"local_amount":3154.7,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3262.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547407},{"amount":40.38,"local_amount":3400.53,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3517.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680377},{"amount":88.86,"local_amount":7483.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7740.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193749},{"amount":87.09,"local_amount":7334.23,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7585.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261720},{"amount":76.06,"local_amount":6417.98,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6638.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.17,"payment_id":649599989}],"funded_date":"2014-05-11T20:46:05Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":706761,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy is 30 years old and single.  \r\n\r\nDaisy and her family survived super typhoon Haiyan which swept through the Philippines last November 8, 2013, but her business and their family home was wiped out. \r\n\r\nDaisy is taking out a housing loan amounting to PHP 10,000 to purchase building materials and pay for construction labor to build a house for her family.

su esposo se dedica a la agricultura desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, con Delmy viven sus cuatro hijos y su esposo.\n\nDelmy se dedica a la agricultura, este trabajo ella lo aprendi\u00f3 de su abuelo que la llevaba a ella cada vez que iba a la milpa a preparar el terreno para cultivar, ella dice que le cost\u00f3 acostumbrarse a andar bajo sol, aguantando hambre y haciendo cosas que ella no esperaba hacer, con el tiempo la necesidad a ella la obligo a tener que hacer ese trabajo.  Delmy aparte de hacer la milpa con su esposo tambi\u00e9n hace ventas en su casa cada domingo.

She lives with her four children and her husband, who has been working in agriculture for five years. Delmy works in agriculture, which she learned from her grandfather, who brought her along each time he went to the farm to prepare the terrain for planting. She says it was hard to get used to walking in the sun, going hungry and doing things she hadn\u2019t planned to do, but over time she had to start working on the farm due to necessity. Apart from the farm, which she runs with her husband, Delmy also sells from her home on Sundays. She prepares fruit drinks, fried yucca and chopped mango, which is in season. These sales help her to cover other needs that she has. Her farm is ten minutes from her house, and the soccer field where she goes to sell her products is 30 minutes away. Her husband is a great help, and she determines her own schedule based on how much work she has to do. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will help her husband buy fertilizer for planting, as well as corn seeds, pesticides and herbicides. She says that she hopes that with this loan she will be able to buy at a lower price, since fertilizer prices are currently low. With this loan she will also help herself, since she will invest in her own business. She says her clients tell her that they want her to sell pupusas. She hasn\u2019t yet done so due to lack of economic resources, but she does want to.  \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to continue to grow corn with her husband to support her household, so that her children are never hungry. They will achieve this by working hard on their land. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1595019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, corn seed, pesticides and herbicides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-08T22:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-07T22:10:12Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delmy Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":703751,"name":"Elvia Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas es una ciudad conocida en Ecuador, porque es el puente que une a la sierra y la costa y adem\u00e1s porque en ella habita la etnia Tsachila, por ello el nombre de la ciudad.

He lives in Sialkot, Pakistan with his spouse and two children. He is the only one responsible for managing the entire household. By profession, Ajmal is an owner of a cosmetics retail shop. He has been doing his business for 10 years. Ajmal needs to buy different types of cosmetics items for reselling purposes but due to insufficient financial means, he is unable to buy this merchandise. Therefore, he has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

muele de las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana a las 9 am y por la tarde de las 3pm a las 5 estas dos jornadas y en esto le ayuda sus dos hijos.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a CREDICAMPO,  es para comprar reparaciones del molino ya que el molino ya est\u00e1 viejo y le hace falta un repuesto. Quiere comprarlo para que este siempre le genere ingresos y as\u00ed pueda tener el alimento para  sus hijos y que nunca les falte las cosas de comer. \n\nLos sue\u00f1os que tiene es que siempre Dios le preste vida para seguir trabajando en el molino y que en su vejez les de a sus hijos los que ellos necesiten y que cuando \u00e9l falte le quede el molino para que ellos sigan trabajando y asi aprendan bien el oficio y puedan defenderse de una u otra manera.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 78 years old and has a third grade education.  He is a widower since his wife died fifteen years ago, leaving him to care for one child who was still very young at the time.  Jos\u00e9 now lives with his two children, both of whom are dependent on him.  <br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9 has been operating a grain mill for 20 years.  He found out on his own that the area where he lives did not have a mill at the time.  Since then, his grain mill has been a source of income that has helped one child with getting an education and graduating from high school.  His mill is in operation in the mornings from 7:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M. and in the afternoons from 3:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M.  During these two shifts, Jos\u00e9 has the help of his children.  <br \/><br \/>The loan he is requesting from CrediCampo will be used to pay for repairs to the mill, which is old and is missing a part.  He wants to pay for these repairs so that he can always generate an income for feeding his children and preventing them from going hungry.  <br \/><br \/>His dreams include allowing God to always provide him with life so that he can continue working at his grain mill.  In his old age, Jos\u00e9 would like to see that his children\u2019s needs are met.  When he dies, he will leave behind the grain mill so that they can continue working.  This will allow them to become good at this trade so that they can support themselves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1594944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for repairs to his grain mill.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T00:50:05Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Napoleon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.74,"local_amount":71.74,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":71.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243804},{"amount":1028.26,"local_amount":1028.26,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1028.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650535913}],"funded_date":"2014-06-03T15:07:39Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:16:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":706710,"name":"Balimaya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe  BALIMAYA  sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de  27 ans, 3 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles polygames \u00e0 FAKOLA, une des pr\u00e9fectures de la 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s \u00e0 tout moment.

She lives here with her single daughter, who has already graduated from school and greatly wants to have higher education. Nunik has vocational education and a specialty of nursing. For many years, she worked in her specialty in Yerevan, then in the Russian Federation, but since 2003 she has been engaged in farming and agriculture. \r\n\r\nNow on her farm, she has 4 piglets, 30 chickens and a large plot of land on which she cultivates wheat. Her fruit garden is colored by the harvest of apples, peaches and pear trees. Some part of her farm goods she manages to sell, and the other part she uses for her small family. \r\n\r\nNunik has a great wish: to be able to pay for her daughter\u2019s private courses that will help her to pass entrance examinations and have a higher education. This will be possible only through good income from her farming and agriculture. So, she will use this loan of 300,000 Armenian drams in order to buy some more chickens and fodder, both for her piglets and chickens as well. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that by making her farm richer, the income from it will also be bigger so that she can help her daughter to have higher education.

Meet Feliece, a smallholder rural farmer based in Nyamira, a rural town in Kisii. She is a mother of five who sells eggs and tea produced on her farm to earn a decent living. She has been in the sector for 14 good years.

They need training and finances to overcome their challenges and make much more income. \r\n\r\nJared is seeking a loan to purchase a water tank. This will help Jared deal with the challenge of water shortages during dry seasons. The nearest river Jared relies on is seasonal. Having a water tank will help Jared store rainwater for irrigating his crops during dry seasons. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Jared will produce vegetables all year round. This will prevent Jared from suffering crop failures that lead to losses during the dry season. The loan will go a long way in helping Jared improve the livelihood of his

For the past 2 years, Esther has been working hard to manage her snack business, which sells crisps and other things. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Esther has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase charcoal and cooking oil for the business, and will help Esther to generate greater profits and help pay school fees for herself and her young siblings. Esther hopes that in the future she will be able to own an agricultural farm. \r\n\r\nEsther is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

as\u00ed es desde los 9 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 trabajando con estos cultivos. \nSeg\u00fan Roberto el trabajo de agricultor es un negocio muy desvalorado por el gobierno ya que tiene que vender a un muy bajo precio y el costo de los insumos agr\u00edcolas como pesticidas, fungicidas, riegos, abonos e insumos agr\u00edcolas en general tiene un muy alto costo y en la mayor\u00eda de casos los agricultores no tienen la forma de acceder a ellos generando p\u00e9rdidas perjudiciales no solo para ellos si no para nosotros que consumimos diariamente los productos cosechados por estos cultivadores. \nPor esto solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de riesgos, abonos, pesticidas, fungicidas para terminar sus cultivos y poder venderlos al mercado. Su principal sue\u00f1o es mantener el negocio familiar en el tiempo, brindarle a su hijo los medios econ\u00f3micos necesarios para que estudie y sea un profesional en el futuro.\n","en":"Roberto is a traditional, family farmer. He has spent his whole life working in this area. A father to one son - 19 years old -, Roberto wants to teach him the values that he himself learned in the field, including humility, effort and work. Regardless of his age - 51 years old - Roberto wakes up very early every morning in order to work at his bean and chick pea plants, and his other crops. Roberto has spent 42 years working in the field, and nine years working with these particular crops.\r\n\r\nAccording to Roberto, farm work is grossly undervalued by the government as farmers have to sell at very low prices and the costs of farming supplies - such as pesticides, anti-fungal chemicals, manure and more - are very high. In most cases, farmers are unable to buy these goods or make substantial losses. These losses are not just for farmers but for all of us who consume these goods every day.\r\n\r\nRoberto is applying for a loan in order to buy manure, weed-killers, anti-fungal chemicals and more in order to finish growing his crops and sell them at the market. Roberto's biggest dream is to keep his family business going, and to offer his son the financial means to study and have a profession in the future."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1595717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy manure, weed-killers, anti-fungal chemicals and more in order to finish growing his crops and sell them at the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65432},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67245},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69109},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71023},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72992},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75014},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77093},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79229},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81424},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83681},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86000},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88383},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90832},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93349},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95935},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98594},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101326},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104133},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107019},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109984},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113032},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116164},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119383},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122691},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126091},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129585},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133176},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136866},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140659},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144556}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.15},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.81},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.71},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.67},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":704198,"name":"Sergio Natividad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio de 65 a\u00f1os de edad, logro estudiar hasta tercer grado en la escuela de su comunidad cuando era un ni\u00f1o;

Sergio buys cattle all week, in whatever community, and then keeps it at the farmyard by his house, before taking them out to sell every Tuesday.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this work, a cattle raiser needs to have cash available and so Sergio needs to invest a loan in a pen for the animals, built with iron purlins. Sergio already has a fence made with wooden posts but these are not in very good condition and the cattle can escape and, on occasions, are never found again. This loan will be invested in a metal fence.\r\n\r\nA couple of years ago Sergio had planned to build this fence but he did not have the money to do it. Now, with the help of a loan, he can do what he has wanted to for so long. He can then also continue with his work, and slowly make the small repayments on his loan, without worrying that his cattle will escape in the night."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1595721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy iron purlins to build a metal fence for his farmyard.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":71.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":79.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":86.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":91.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":707900,"name":"Carmem","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"\nResidente da Ponta de Ouro, solteira e m\u00e3e de tr\u00eas meninas, com idades compreendidas de 05 a 18 anos de idade, encontra se a viver na ponta de ouro por motivos profissionais.\nCom o valor de empr\u00e9stimo pretendi comprar um congelador, microondas, um televisor para uso dom\u00e9stico, um ferro de engomar e um fog\u00e3o a g\u00e1s.\nO seu maior sonho \u00e9 abrir seu pr\u00f3prio neg\u00f3cio e a n\u00edvel profissional gostaria de ter uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o monet\u00e1ria mensal porque ai ter\u00e1 como pagar mais r\u00e1pido o cr\u00e9dito.

The loan will be used to buy more wheat flour, sugar, bananas and cooking oil for the business, and will help Monica to generate greater profits and take care of her family's basic needs. Monica hopes that in the future, she will be able to start up a retail shop. \r\n\r\nMonica is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Irene is 19 years old, and lives in the town of Natete in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is married, and has two children who are both currently in school. \r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Irene has been working hard to manage her boutique business, selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Irene has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more types of clothes to attract more clients in her shop. It will help Irene to generate greater profits and to pay for school fees and other basic needs. \r\n\r\nIrene hopes that in the future she will be able to own a residential house. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1599765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

This farmer hails from Nyamira, an area in Kenya popular for growing bananas. \r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years, he has been taking care care of his wife and three children by selling milk, eggs and tea produced on his farm. He also ventures into small seasonal businesses to keep afloat during low seasons.\r\n\r\nOne activity with no low seasons Peter enjoys is the selling of eggs! He is determined to expand this sector, though his biggest challenge remains the lack of adequate funds. \r\n\r\nPeter is seeking a loan from Kiva through Juhudi Kilimo to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nPeople like Peter cannot get formal financing from banks because they are smallholder farmers with irregular income from deep rural areas. But Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva are organizations with a different approach. They see potential in such farmers that every other organization just can\u2019t see. \r\n\r\nIncome from the additional poultry will help Peter settle the high farm related costs after successfully completing the loan. The loan will help Peter\u2019s family have a better living as a result of more profits from poultry.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1599775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1209.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1501.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1525.71},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1566.81},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1621.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1652.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1706.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1743.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1790.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1853.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1888.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1940.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.01,"local_amount":3280.4,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3571.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287527},{"amount":19.91,"local_amount":1593.16,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1734.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570877},{"amount":19.25,"local_amount":1539.91,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1676.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054233},{"amount":20.87,"local_amount":1669.39,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1817.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547413},{"amount":15.75,"local_amount":1260.02,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1371.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680383},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":1666.59,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1814.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624680},{"amount":24.78,"local_amount":1982.78,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2158.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193754},{"amount":47.99,"local_amount":3839.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4180.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261722},{"amount":23.99,"local_amount":1922.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2093.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":649599992},{"amount":15.34,"local_amount":1245.27,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1355.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.23,"payment_id":665458659}],"funded_date":"2014-05-17T23:16:17Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":706883,"name":"Armen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armen lives in the Haykashen village with his wife and three children (ages 18, 16 and 8 years old).\r\n\r\nArmen's elder son, Henrik, studies at university.

For the past three years, Juliet has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells essential commodities. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Juliet has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a fridge, soda and maize flour to sell, and will help Juliet to generate greater profits and improve her family standards of living. Juliet hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nJuliet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the last two years, she has been solely practicing dairy and poultry farming. Predictably, her primary income comes from the selling of milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nWhat Esther finds as the most enjoyable part of farming is the selling of eggs. She also so much enjoys the company of her cow that she later came to name her Ethugo. However, animal diseases pose the biggest challenge for her.\r\n\r\nEsther is happy with her financial service provider Juhudi Kilimo. This is what she had to say: 'It's my interest to be a farmer and Juhudi is a financial partner to farmers.\"\r\n\r\nEsther is seeking a loan to purchase poultry.

He lives with his parents in a village not far from the district. He has a very close-knit family. Alisher and his older brother have a small shop at the entrance of the central market and work there together. They sell airline tickets and provide internet services. Because he lives in an agricultural area, he also grows rice with his family.\r\n\r\nAlisher has decided to renovate his house while the weather is warm. He wants to install plastic windows for soundproofing and heating insulation before he gets married. After all, everybody would want to start married life in a beautiful home with all the amenities to make it cozy for his future wife and children. Alisher does not have the money to make his dreams a reality. He learned about Arvand's financial services from his acquaintances and decided to take out a loan. He hopes very much for financial support and promises to pay the loan on time without any problems."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1586444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase and install plastic windows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alisher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":362},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":359.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":387.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":386.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":393.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":411.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":417.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":428.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":440.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":448.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":464.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":501.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.21,"local_amount":362,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":365.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875716},{"amount":73.69,"local_amount":359.45,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":362.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302943},{"amount":877.1,"local_amount":4278.55,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4316.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585741}],"funded_date":"2014-05-27T03:03:59Z","paid_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":706872,"name":"Heriqnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heriqnaz lives in Byurakn village with her mother, father and two brothers.

Meet Jane, a smallholder lady farmer who lives in Litein, Kenya. She is a mother of four who has been practicing agriculture for 10 years now. She makes money selling milk, eggs, and tea produced from her farm. \r\n\r\nShe likes milking the cow with her children in the morning and in the afternoon every day.  Her passion extends to the point of naming her cow Lelkina.  \r\n\r\nJane is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. Poultry farming is swiftly gaining traction in Kenya as the demand of poultry products is skyrocketing. Jane used to keep poultry for subsistence until she attended Juhudi Kilimo agribusiness training. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, Jane opted to take a Kiva loan because of the favorable repayment period and interest rate terms that favor small scale farmers.\r\nWith your loan, Jane will generate enough income to comfortably repay the loan. The extra income will go to Jane's family expenses. \r\n\r\nIn the long run, Jane\u2019s family will see an increase in their income courtesy of the lenders of this

Art guides my hands in that moment of pleasure as I begin a design. My pieces are inspired by the olden times and reflect the style of vintage pieces. They transmit my love for life and for nature \u2014 its flowers, birds and all the rich flora and fauna of our country.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful for the support you offer craftspeople who dedicate our lives to this art.

I started buying finished carvings, and in the evenings I learned to carve these beautiful items. My inspiration comes through dreams, so when I wake up I immediately put the design on paper in order not to lose the idea.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I thank all of you for making this microcredit possible, and especially for being there for me anytime I fall.

Meet Bernard, a smallholder farmer based in Kitale, a rural town in Kenya. For the last 2 years, Bernard has been selling milk, eggs and maize from his farm to make a living. He also engages in other small seasonal businesses to earn extra income. \r\n\r\nThe activity Bernard finds most enjoyable is when he collects eggs every morning from the poultry house. However, poultry diseases pose a very big challenge to Bernard and other poultry farmers. \r\n\r\nBernard has two dairy cows on his farm named 'Tausi' and 'Blacky'. Bernard is seeking a loan to construct a cowshed for his two cows. The shelter will shield them from adverse weather conditions. It will also free the grazing land for other farming activities. Bernard stands to increase profits significantly after introducing zero-grazing. The additional income will be plowed back to grow his farming operations. Some of the produce will also be used to improve his family's diet.

At 25 years old, she has five children with her partner with whom she lives. She currently sells Amway products, as suggested by a friend. With the grace of God, she has done well, however, her main difficulty is that most customers do not recognize the products and making a sale is difficult. She trusts that once they have purchased the product they will be greatly satisfied and continue to request products and recommend her to other clients. She is requesting a loan for the purchase of Amway products for distribution to more people in other neighborhoods and, if possible, other municipalities. She wants to continue to fulfill her wish of providing her five children with food, shelter, clothing, and an education. Despite her economic status, she wants to always give them everything they need. The smiles of the faces of her five children is her principal motivation in life.

He engages in scientific ways of growing maize. Last farming season, he grew 40 tons of yellow maize from 30 acres of cultivated farmland. Zakaria sells the maize to Masara Farmers Association base in Ghana and does marketing for the maize. His farm has a good number of shea trees, and his wife and her group members gather the nuts for processing into shea butter.\r\n\r\nZakaria is asking for a loan of 4,200 GHS to buy 56 bags of fertilizer (NPK) to cultivate 40 acres of yellow maize.

Meet Caroline, a mother of 3 who practises dairy farming for a living in Litein, a remote town in of Kenya. For the past 8 years, Caroline has been selling milk from her cows. She also engages in other personal businesses to make extra money.\r\n\r\nApart from the common challenges facing farmers in her region, such as lack of finances, Caroline finds farming to be the ideal economic activity.

They formed a group called Yotik, and then joined Juhudi Kilimo, which partnered with KIVA to provide individual loans to each member of the group last year. \r\n\r\nThis year, Caroline has bigger aspirations. She is seeking a loan to construct a greenhouse, which will bring Caroline more profits than any business she is currently involved in. Caroline will be able to produce fresh vegetables and fruits throughout the year. She will also be able to control the environment her crops grow in to achieve the best quality. Caroline is booking appointments with institutions and hotels to secure orders once she is started. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Caroline will realize her dream of being a very renowned entrepreneur. She wants to be an example to her children that it doesn't matter where you are from or where you are today; with vision, hard work and determination, you can be somebody in life.

She is 46 years old.  Zuvaida's husband passed away several years ago, and she has been raising two children alone, overcoming all of life's hardships.  Zuvaida and her children live in a village.  She tries with all her strengths to ensure that her children do not have any needs and not feel the absence of their father.  Zuvaida works as a salesperson at a village market.  She sells diesel, but this is not Zuvaida's main business.  Afterall, the salesperson work is inconsistent and unstable - at any time, she could lose her job.  This is why Zuvaida is involved in animal husbandry. She raises cattle at home.  Her son and father-in-law help her with this.  Thanks to animal husbandry, Zuvaida's life is improving.  She used the money from livestock sales to hold a wedding for her daughter.  Her son is now next.  It's time for him to get married.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to feed livestock in the winter because all of the feed has to be bought, whereas in the summer, livestock can feed at a pasture. Zuvaida recently sold livestock and wants to buy two more, but does not have enough money to buy cattle.  This is why she put in a request for a loan to increase her livestock headcount.  Zuvaida hopes very much for the support from Arvand and would like to partner with the organization in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1587810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Ghrard  also does bike transport part-time to support his business. He is positive the business will succeed because he has experience, knows where to buy at reduced prices, and has regular customers who always buy from him. \r\n\r\nThe profit from the loan will be used for feeding of his family, education of his children, expansion of the business by buying more items, and building his house.

He is a hard-working man who is known in his canton as someone who is responsible and helpful with his neighbors.  He lives with his parents and works to help them.  They are of an advanced age, and it is difficult for them to earn the income needed to support the family. \r\n\r\nJuan works the land.  He grows staple grains (corn, beans and sorghum).  He gets up very early so he can finish his work by noon.  In the afternoon, he helps with the household chores.  Juan also works as a brick-layer's assistant. \r\n\r\nJuan needs the loan to purchase agricultural supplies (fertilizers, seeds, pesticide products and other items).  With the money, he will take advantage of the approaching rainy season and prepare his land for planting.  At the moment, Juan does not have the financial resources he needs, and so he has decided to take out the loan. \r\n\r\nJuan's dream is to be able to buy a plot of land where he can build a small house, which is another one of his dreams.  He also wants to learn to grow vegetables, as he is looking to diversify his income so he can guarantee himself a living.

He started his business over six years ago to help homeowners with foreclosures in his hometown of Miami. Today, the practice has added new areas within real estate including representing investors, homeowner associations and condominium associations. \r\n\r\nRaymond's greatest success came when he won an appeal before the Supreme Court of Florida. He has also co-authored books on real estate transactions that are published by the Florida Bar. Always passionate about helping other more than himself, he has had difficulty pricing services that are acceptable to the client and profitable for his business. He has adjusted by implementing fee schedules. \r\n\r\nIn order to serve the growing number of clients seeking his service, Raymond needs to hire additional staff. This loan will provide him with the capital to do so. \r\n\r\nHelp this passionate entrepreneur and father of two grow his business, provide jobs and have time to spend with his children!\r\n "}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1592549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to hire additional staff members","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Miami, Florida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":9575,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raymond","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":9554.95,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":9575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":311.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":347.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":355.43},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":356.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":360.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":368.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":370.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":377.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":379.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":384.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":396.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":394.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":401.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":404.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":411.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":414.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":420.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":426.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":431.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":437.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":442.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":447.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":454.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":459.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":369.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":405.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":421.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":431.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":438.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":443},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":448.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455.1},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":707059,"name":"Crisanta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Crisanta works hard to support her family.

Even if he does not pursue carving as a career, he can still teach his son in order to pass this family legacy on, for generations to come.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I want to express my gratitude to all of you who are helping fund this microcredit.

She sells the vintage goods from an artist studio in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington D.C.  Lisa got her start in the vintage retail business by way of her blog, Quarter Life, which she created in 2009 and features her writings about DC\u2019s vintage shops and thrift stores.  After spending several years covering vintage finds, she got the itch to open her own brick-and-mortar vintage space.  She started with a couple of pop-up shops, and selling at various markets and online, and then in 2013, the perfect opportunity presented itself \u2013 the Brookland neighborhood was undergoing a large renovation project and allocated several spaces for artistic and cultural purposes. Lisa seized the opportunity to open her first retail space in one of the artist studios.  \r\n\r\nShe requested a $5,000 loan to help her prepare for the busier spring and summer season. She plans to extend the studio hours on Saturdays to coincide with the neighborhood farmers market. Lisa will need to hire a part-time associate to assist with the increased store hours, and will need access to capital to cover the cost of the increased hours.  The neighborhood is steadily gaining more foot traffic and visitors to the artist studio and the loan will help Lisa be ready for this growth in the near future.

","en":"Askarali is an active and energetic young man from the Vakhsh region. He is 31 years old. He has set himself goals in life, the most important of which was starting his own business. Four years ago Askarali opened a shop where he sells food products and household goods. His younger brother helps him with the business. They work seven days a week and earn money every day from sales. He has a large family of 12 people: his mother, father, three brothers, two sisters, sister-in-law, three nephews, and himself. Askarali is still single. He works hard in order to provide for himself and to someday start a family. In order to achieve his goals, Askarali is expanding his business. He has asked for a loan in order to buy an ice cream machine, a refrigerator, and a water cooler. He needs this equipment for summer because it is the season of ice cream and soft drinks. Askarali hopes for support so that he can develop his small business.

She realized there was a lack of authentic, pure and natural products in the United States from Africa. In 2013, she decided to launch Juka's Organic Co. Her objective is to combine a variety of innovative items (Organic Red Palm Oil, Shea butter, Herbal Medicines, African Tea and lots more) from the historic past of Africa to tailor them to fit today's contemporary life while still maintaining the authenticity of these products. Growing up in West Africa, Juka was inspired by her family members who were all involved in prominent businesses in her community. Her father was the first one to introduce Sonoco Motor Oil throughout her country and her grandfather was the first one to have owned a supermarket in his village. With the help and guidance of her mother, who has launched and owned many successful businesses in the African community, Juka was able to partner with women from small villages of West Africa to exclusively supply their hand selected, unrefined sustainable organic red palm oil.

due to hardships involved with the passing of both of his parents. He currently resides in Los Angeles, CA, where he has plans to open his business and eventually expand on an international basis.\r\n\r\nTerry's entrepreneurial spirit was shaped by his first job after graduate school. This particular job required him to sell investment products to individuals and small businesses through his own resources. With the skills he gained, Terry has over 13 years of expertise as a financial advisor, obtaining his Certified Financial Planner designation in 2009. Terry is also a licensed Series 7 and 66 CFP, currently working for Kelly Services.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan will help Terry start his financial consulting business, Minority Capital Advisors, helping clients map out their financial plan based on their unique circumstances. With his new company, Terry will also be providing educational workshops for groups seeking advice on investments and personal finances.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2064.29,"image":{"id":1596670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Kiva

He has been married for 42 years, and his wife is a homemaker.  They have four children together, none of which live with them since they all have their own homes.  Four people live in Luis's home, as two of his grandchildren, who are in elementary school, live with him.  Luis has 60 years of experience working in agriculture, a trade that he learned from his father who taught him how to grow corn, beans and other products.  This is his only job, and he has always been dedicated to it.  His workplace is close to his home since he lives on the same land that he works on.  What is difficult for him is getting his agricultural supplies to his home because he travels 23 kilometers to buy them.  He works about six hours a day.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from CREDICAMPO will be used to purchase agricultural supplies such as manure, seeds, herbicides and other products needed to grow corn, sorghum and beans.  The loan will improve his business because he will have the supplies to plant more than he was able to last year, and he will generate more income.  The loan will satisfy his need to obtain the agricultural supplies in time.  The client's dreams are to continue to progress through his source of work to get his family ahead.  He wishes to purchase another plot of land to expand his crops and to have a greater income for his family.  He hopes to continue supporting them, taking care of them and giving his wife everything she needs.

","en":"Greis, who is 22 years old, has been working selling early childhood teaching materials for the past four years. She first started gaining experience while helping her mother-in-law to sell these items and earning a commission for her sales. This was very useful because since she studied to become a secretary and was hired after her internship, this income allowed her to invest and her coworkers became her first customers. From then on, Greis started making orders and got help from her mother-in-law to sell rubber stamps, pillows, rugs, and other items, which she offers through a catalog. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to have more capital in order to satisfy her customers' demand. She wants to have her own house, but the biggest challenge she faces is how to obtain enough money to be able to invest. That is the reason why she is turning to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan, which will be her first. She will use it to buy rubber stamps, swings, inflatables, a wooden human body model, foam play mats, and puzzles. This investment will allow Greis to promote demand by customers, located mainly in nearby schools."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1595800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rubber stamps, swings, inflatables, a wooden human body model, foam mats, and puzzles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T21:30:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Greis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":63946},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76064},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78346},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80697},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83118},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85611},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88179},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90825},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93550},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109664}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.85,"local_amount":63946,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":65608.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504260464},{"amount":40.27,"local_amount":76064,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":78041.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542749},{"amount":41.48,"local_amount":78346,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":80382.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530025994},{"amount":42.72,"local_amount":80697,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":82794.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518184},{"amount":43.43,"local_amount":83118,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":85278.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.57,"payment_id":562430817},{"amount":81.55,"local_amount":173790,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":178307.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.46,"payment_id":579566561},{"amount":42.16,"local_amount":90825,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":93185.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.92,"payment_id":611788998},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":93550,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":95981.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.95,"payment_id":624849198},{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":109664,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":112514.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.28,"payment_id":649571986}],"funded_date":"2014-05-19T05:55:06Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:45:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":707142,"name":"Elsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"An $800 loan is offered to Elsa to improve her business.

She lives in the Koh Sotin district of Kampong Cham province. To cover her daily cost of living, she farms rice as the main source of income and she weaves palm leaves as a supplementary source of income. It is the business that she has had for ages and it has returned her 35,600 KHR per day. Now, she leads a group of three to get a new loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). This is not the original loan for her and her joint borrowers. She used her past loan with success to improve her lifestyle at a gradual pace.

She is married and has three children. She is 36 years old. Marhabo grew up in the village far from the city. Since childhood, she has held a love for her native village and home. Marhabo's parents raised their children to engage in agriculture and animal husbandry. After marriage, Marhabo began to help her husband, and also began farming her own plot of land. Now, Marhabo is raising beautiful children. For now, they are in school. But because rural children learn hard work from a young age, Marhabo's children also help their parents.

She married and has raised three children. She has a middle school education. Her family's occupation is farming and gardening. She has been accustomed to this work since childhood. So, her three children have also grown up helping their parents grow cotton and caring for the garden. Munavar's family is growing because there are grandchildren and the family's needs are increasing. Munavar, her \u200b\u200bhusband and their children plant cotton every year with love. The new generation of her family is growing up, and Munavar would like to see her grandchildren receive a good education and become specialists in the field of agronomy. To achieve these goals, this year Munavar's family wants to buy high-yield seeds and sow cotton in plots of land between the orchard, which has been cleared of stones. For this purpose, she wants to request a loan from \"Arvand \". She is grateful that \"Arvand\" will give her the opportunity to achieve her goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1587895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cotton seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-09T22:30:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-08T22:30:32Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munavar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":618},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":636.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":655.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":675.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":695.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":718.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.46,"local_amount":618,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":618.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875719},{"amount":131.29,"local_amount":636.54,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":637.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302946},{"amount":135.23,"local_amount":655.64,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":656.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585744},{"amount":139.28,"local_amount":675.31,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":675.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081327},{"amount":143.46,"local_amount":695.56,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":696.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562206},{"amount":148.28,"local_amount":718.95,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":719.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694893}],"funded_date":"2014-05-13T15:08:43Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aleksandra Fridman","image":1262466}},{"id":707187,"name":"Angelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelita works hard to support her family.
