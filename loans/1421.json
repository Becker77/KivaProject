He has built up very good relation with his regular customers. Nowadays, a lot of demand increases for accessories and for recharge, that sometimes he has to refuse his customers. Therefore, he wants to open his own mobile shop. But he does not have savings to invest into the business because he already has spent all his savings on household expenses.\r\n \r\nTherefore, Ulfat requested a loan for her son so that he would be able to open a new mobile shop.

Many national and international tourists come to this area in order to enjoy the wonderful scenery and the places to relax that line the highway.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here in R\u00edo Blanco that 33-year-old Hugo lives and runs his business. Hugo is a single father to one son - aged one year and three months - whom he had in a previous relationship. Hugo was born and raised in a humble and very hard-working family. Hugo has been making a living in farming since he was a child.

For the past many days his rickshaw has not been working properly because of regular uses. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of new rickshaw. \r\n\r\nTherefore Tahira has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw.

","en":"Firuza was born in 1977. She is divorced. She lived for several years with her husband and then got a divorce. After her divorce she returned to her parents' home. At that time her parents had a large low-income family. It was very hard for  Firuza to be financially supported by her brothers. Firuza was forced to launch her own business since she did not have higher education. Thus even years ago she reached out to IMON and obtained her first loan. Firuza started a business buying and selling children's clothing. She grew her business gradually. At present she has her own sales stand and loyal customers.

However due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw.

Meet Teresia, a woman of strength. She is a mother with six children dependent on her. She lives in Nyamira, a remote village in Kenya where the main staple food is banana! To provide her family with a decent living, for the last 30 years Teresia has been selling milk, eggs, tea and vegetables produced on her farm to the local market. She also gets involved in numerous seasonal businesses to make extra money for personal expenses. \r\n\r\nShe is appreciative of the fact that farming, \"creation of food\" as she calls it, gave her a purpose in life. In particular, she is very passionate about dairy farming. She encourages other farmers to keep quality dairy animals because they are lucrative. She makes the most profit by selling milk daily. However, limited funds for growth is her biggest challenge. Most of her income is spent on farming related costs due to expensive inputs.\r\n\r\nTeresia is seeking a loan to purchase another dairy animal. She has conducted a feasibility study. She discovered there is a big demand for milk and an even bigger supply of milk. This has led to reduced prices and other market conditions since producers have no bargaining power over buyers. \r\nWith your loan, Teresia is going use the milk from the additional cow to venture into the value addition chain. She will still be selling raw milk to repay the loan and sustain the agribusiness at first. In time, she will start enjoying bigger profit margins from ghee, cheese, yogurt and other products. Once the value chain business picks up, she will transition her whole dairy operation in a parallel shift to the value added chain.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Teresia is just looking for ways to generate more income so that her family can enjoy better living standards.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1600496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-05-10T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-09T17:50:05Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3773.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4684.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4760.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4888.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5058.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5156.43},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5324.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5438.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5585.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5782.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5891.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":6055.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.43},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.18},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.07,"local_amount":10162.5,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10278.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287533},{"amount":57.44,"local_amount":4943.89,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5000.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570885},{"amount":55.5,"local_amount":4776.5,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4830.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054239},{"amount":60.19,"local_amount":5180.42,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5239.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547420},{"amount":61.65,"local_amount":5306.49,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5366.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680389},{"amount":60.89,"local_amount":5240.75,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5300.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624686},{"amount":64.69,"local_amount":5568.13,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5631.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193760},{"amount":246.57,"local_amount":21221.32,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":21463.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261726}],"funded_date":"2014-05-11T01:46:50Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":707342,"name":"Rose Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose Marie is 33 years old and married with six children.

Meet Julius, a father of 2 from Kisii, a rural town in Kenya with a hot and wet climate. Julius is a mixed farmer with over 6 years of experience. He makes money selling milk, eggs, tea and vegetables produced on his farm. He also makes extra income engaging in other personal businesses.\r\n\r\nHe finds farming, especially dairy farming, to be enjoyable and profitable. The biggest challenge for all farmers in the region is lack of a good road network. Poor roads make it hard for farmers to transport their produce to the market.\r\n\r\nJulius is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. Milk prices in Kisii are always high and stable. Julius is determined to acquire more cows and produce more milk. He is also breeding his cows with the assistance of an agricultural extension officer to ensure the calves inherit the most desirable traits from pedigree bulls. \"Higher quality cows produce much more milk than regular ones.

Her family had a lot of financial issues, which meant that she could only stay in school until 6th grade. Her children are now grown-up, and some have left home.

Mar\u00eda sells fruit, vegetables and catalogue items. She learnt this activity from her mother when she was little.

He is 19 years old, single, and thanks to the efforts of his parents, he was able to finish primary school.  But the lack of financial resources forced him to work from a very young age in order to support his needs. He currently lives with some family members in a neighborhood that is very far from town. Many of the people here work at making brooms and cleaning materials, and also in agriculture and raising livestock. This area is called Pastocalle, in the rural part of Cotopaxi Province in the Republic of Ecuador. Its people live day to day working at these activities.  Although it is far from the city, there are families who have undertaken all kinds of activity to cover their necessities and those of the community. \r\n\r\nEddy learned how to raise animals from his parents. This work enabled them to get ahead and meet their needs. Eddy does this work for 3 to 4 hours every day since the cows are milked twice a day - once in the morning and once in the afternoon. With the experience he has gained through the years seeing the growth of his small business, today he recognizes that he needs one more dairy cow because one of the ones he has is about to enter her dry period. This is why he needs the loan.  He also needs it to complete the paperwork for a small piece of land that his father gave him.\r\n\r\nWhat Eddy hopes for most is that the investment he makes will result in an increase in production, thus allowing him to improve his and his family's life style. Eddy wants to send warm regards and to thank Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en Ecuador and Kiva for making it possible for him to grow personally and at

He is married and has a child.  For a while now he has been dreaming of fixing the facade of his house.  He saved up some money and started the process of improving his house.  Unfortunately, he ran out of funds and was not able to finish the job.  Mykola is asking for a loan to purchase building materials necessary to complete the improvements.  The new exterior will make the house look nice and additional improvements will weatherize it against the cold and will save money on the energy bills.

Chrisantus enjoys farming because, despite challenges such as poor road networks and lack of market, he has been able to sustain his family comfortably with farming as his main source of income. \r\n\r\nChrisantus is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. He prides himself on being a good cow caretaker. Those close to him say he personally pampers his animals. Chrisantus wants to get another cow to better utilize the available pasture. He grew fodder this year and expanded his shed to accommodate two more cows that he plans to acquire. The income he projects to generate will be enough to relieve the burden of school fees off his shoulders.

Augustine has been a small dairy farmer for the last 13 years in Kisii, a rural town in Kenya. He possesses about two acres of land, which includes his house and cowshed. He was struggling to meet his family's basic needs, let alone paying school fees for his 4 children, until last year.\r\n\r\nLast year, Augustine joined Juhudi Kilimo, microfinance for smallholder farmers based in deep-rural areas who cannot access finances through banks. Augustine attended various agri-business trainings to be eligible for a dairy loan. Since the training, Augustine perceives dairy farming as not only a science, but also a business. He got rid of the traditional breeds he kept for 12 years in exchange for 3 grade cows that produce thrice the amount of milk. Besides increased yield, Juhudi's extension officer, Tobiko, has guided him on proper feeding and management of dairy cows, feed supplements, sources and contact persons for good quality semen, animal first-aid and preventive health care.  \r\n\r\nAugustine is fully equipped to be a successful farmer and he is taking a further step of seeking a loan to purchase another dairy cow. His major challenge is raising funds. Most of his income is spent paying for expensive farm inputs and his children's school fees.\r\n \r\nWith your loan, Augustine is going to have four quality dairy cows! The additional income will go to converting the temporary shed into a permanent tiled-roof one with enough space for each animal. His dream will be achieved the day his wife and children will get to enjoy a socio-economic status in the village for living a comfortable life.

Reynaldo needs a loan to capitalize his business by buying tables and clothing, which he will sell from his house and, in so doing, will be able to increase his income. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1596491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-05-11T02:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-10T02:50:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynaldo \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":195,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":32.5,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":33.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490876450},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":32.5,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":33.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504303706},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":32.5,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":33.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517586531},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":32.5,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":33.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530082082},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":32.5,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":33.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562984},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":32.5,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":33.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695615}],"funded_date":"2014-05-14T13:01:23Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacob Bintliff","image":789150}},{"id":704773,"name":"Emely Altaracia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Emely Altagracia es una joven estudiante de medicina, ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para poder cubrir sus gastos educativos, esta es su historia: Mi nombre es Emely tengo 20 a\u00f1os, soy de La Vega, Rep.

Meet Evaline, a mother of three, from Litein, a remote village in Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the last nine years of her life farming. She sells milk, tea, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also offers transportation solutions to other farmers in Litein using her motorcycle. Evaline is a go-getter, who occasionally engages in various seasonal businesses to make extra money. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities she involves herself in, dairy is the one she is cut out for. She enjoys milking the cows at dawn and in the evening before preparing supper. She is very close to her cows. She makes a point to name and follow up on every animal she gets into her compound. \r\n\r\nEvaline is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow.

Only two of her children, her husband and her granddaughter live with her. \r\n\r\nSantos performs household chores, but also cultivates corn in a small plot of land. Her children support her financially. She has worked in agriculture for 10 years. Her parents were laborers and she was interested in this activity. She likes working and growing products. She has always performed domestic chores. Her husband helps her directing the required activities related to the sowing of basic grains. When she works in agriculture, she does it from 7:00 a.m. until noon.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy all the supplies for the sowing of basic grains, such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, will pay for agricultural labor and a current loan, and will buy 6 sheets, 8 beams, two pounds of nails and 50 cane sticks to improve her home's roof. The loan will help her ameliorate her quality of life, as she will improve her production and will be able to live in a better environment where her children will be more at ease under their new roof. \r\n  \r\nSantos' dream is for her daughter to finish her studies, to see her with a degree in Education, and for her to have a job in the future so that she could contribute to her family's sustenance.

","en":"Saodat has been earning a living sewing for seven years. She is 51 and lives in the Vakhsh region with her son and three daughters. The older daughters help her with her work and the youngest daughter and son are still in school. Saodat is raising her children alone, without a husband. She works diligently to take care of her family. Saodat learned how to sew in her youth from her mother and this skill has helped her a great deal in life. Thanks to her sewing abilities she is able to earn a living, since she only has a high school education. Therefore Saodat is grateful to her mother for teaching her this trade.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Saodat intends to expand her business. She is requesting a loan to acquire a new, modern sewing machine on which she will be able to sew quicker and better and to do embroidery on dresses. This will help her to improve the quality of her orders and in such a way to improve her family's financial

Right now is the planting time for most of the crops and the residents of Ravshan's village are all busy planting. Ravshan is also a farmer and needs to prepare his fields for planting. He is a hard-working, optimistic and outgoing young man. He is 20, married and lives with his parents in the village. As we just mentioned, Ravshan is a farmer, but he also applies plaster and lime coating in houses. He works as part of a team and this construction work is seasonal. But because of it, in summer Ravshan is tremendously busy, he tries to get it all done. Most of his time and attention, without a doubt, goes towards his fieldwork. Unfortunately, Ravshan is currently having financial difficulties and needs additional money for his business. For this reason he has turned to microfinance bank \"Arvand\" and he hopes the organization can support him. In the future Ravshan dreams of having a family, but first he needs to become independent and be able to provide for his future family and raise his children well.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1581462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-11T06:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-10T06:30:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ravshan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":464},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":477.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":492.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":507.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":522.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":536.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3059.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490875721}],"funded_date":"2014-05-22T05:28:47Z","paid_date":"2014-06-17T16:11:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":707469,"name":"Remedios","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remedios is 50 years old and married with three children, one of whom is in school.

","en":"Ihtierdjon is 47 years old. He has a large and tightly knit family. He is married and has three amazing children, whom he raised to be just as hardworking as himself. Ihtierdjon owns a small grocery store where he sells various goods. The whole family helps managing the family business. His wife and his older children help out in the store, while the youngest kids are still attending school. As his children are growing, Ihtierdjon has found that their needs and expenses grow as well. Since his store is popular among the residents, Ihtierdjon wants to expand the assortment of groceries he is offering and so earn additional profits. To finance this expansion Ihtierdjon has turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan. He especially liked how fast and convenient is was to fill out a loan application. He hopes that this loan will allow him to make his business plans a reality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1598661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He has a large family - a wife and four children. Abdumajid has a professional school degree. Now that his kids are growing up Abdumajid wants to give them a good education. As his children want to move to the big city they need to have useful and well-paying professions. Abdumajid's wife and kids help him with the family business - cattle. Abdumajid sells the meat and his wife milks cows and sells various dairy products. But in order to pay for his kid's education the business needs to expand and thus Abdumajid decided to buy another calf.

He learned it from when he was young and his parents brought him to work and to have lunch, and as they had no other source of income, he did this work. He was able to learn through this productive activity, and has always been a farmer. The place where he works is five minutes from his house; he doesn't have to take the bus or walk very far.

He will also pay workers to help him prepare the land where he is going to plant. This will satisfy his need to be able to buy all the supplies, since without the loan it is quite difficult for him to buy them.\r\n\r\nIsmael's dreams are to work hard as a farmer, to produce well and, if possible, sell a part of the harvest and give his children a better quality of life.

She is single and thinks about the future, which is why she wants to start a prosperous business before thinking about having a family. Yesika currently lives with her family and was working in different shops. She then started to set up her own business, gradually stocking it up until she had a full grocery store. She now also wants to start selling vegetables and more soft drinks. She needs a loan in order to buy stock such as grains, drinks, and groceries to strengthen her business. Yesika's big dream is to gradually turn her shop into a self-service store and, little by little, to have a full market with a policy of humility, respect and good customer service. Yesika knows that this is a difficult task but, with God's help, she can do it. She started with very basic stock and now has one of the best-stocked shops in the area.

This is his main source of income, the one that enables him to support his family. He is also a farmer. His weaving is done at home from 6 in the morning to 2 in the afternoon. He asks for a loan in order to buy farming supplies so as to grow sweetcorn, which is in season. He will buy 5 sacks of fertiliser and a bag of sweetcorn seeds, and will also hire farm hands. He wants his family to have enough food and benefit from a balanced diet, and therefore wishes for a plentiful harvest that would repay the trouble he takes in caring for the crops. His idea is to sell what exceeds their needs in order to make a small profit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1596566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming supplies and hire farm hands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-11T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-10T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":35.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":38.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":41.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":47.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.47,"local_amount":36.47,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":36.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243448},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":77.72,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":77.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526578},{"amount":38.26,"local_amount":38.26,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":38.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530008990},{"amount":80.1,"local_amount":80.1,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":80.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419843},{"amount":87.09,"local_amount":87.09,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145024},{"amount":45.23,"local_amount":45.23,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":45.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768664},{"amount":135.13,"local_amount":135.13,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":135.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200232}],"funded_date":"2014-06-10T11:54:49Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:59:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":707493,"name":"Wisdom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammed is a father of one child who is still in school.
