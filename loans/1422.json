With his previous loans, all of which he paid back successfully, he used them to make his business grow by purchasing more fruits, bought a motorbike for transportation and shop stock. He is doing great and is thankful to Kiva who has supported his group. He used the increased income to cover school fees and home food expenses.

","en":"Sarodjon is an elderly woman of 62. She has four children, all of whom have long been married and living on their own. Sarodjon's husband has passed away and now she has to maintain her household on her own, with help from her children when they are able. But Sarodjon can't depend solely on her children - she herself helps to take care of her growing grandchildren. She is a hardworking, positive woman who loves her children and grandchildren very much.\r\n\r\nSarodjon keeps a cow and processes the milk she gets in order to earn money to help her children and grandchildren. After the long, cold winter she has run out of feed and with the arrival of spring she needs to buy more feed for her cow. Since processing milk from this cow is Sarodjon's main source of income, she wouldn't want to sell her because of a shortage of feed and in that way lose her means of earning a living. In order to purchase the necessary amount of feed, Sarodjon needs a loan, which is why she has turned to Arvand. She thanks Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1590179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He only went to school up to 4th grade because it was very difficult to study before. He has a wife, who works making embroidery products such as tablecloths. He only has a daughter who goes to preschool. His mother, wife, daughter and two more brothers live with him.  \r\nWaldin works growing basic grains such as corn, bean and sorghum. He also gets mezcal when it is in harvest. He has been scraping mezcal for 8 years and growing basic grains for 10. He learned this from his father who worked in these activities and who left him the motor that is needed for it. He decided to grow more mezcal and this is how he works doing it. He does not have any another productive work since he has almost always worked as a daily worker, and with this he has helped to support his family. The lot of land where he works is behind his house. He does not walk much to get to his place of work; just when he works for someone else he does. Only his wife helps him in his work. With this loan Waldin will buy agricultural inputs for farming, agave pups to repopulate his mezcal field, and with the rest he will pay for hand labor to help him in his work. With the loan he will buy what is needed and increase his capital. His dream is to increase his cattle since at the moment he only has two bovines. When he buys more he will be able to have milking cows, which will generate income through the sale of dairy products. Everything he will do with hard work and knowing how to manage his earnings.

Meet Anna. Anna is a smallholder rural farmer based in Kitale, an agricultural farm in rural Kenya. She was blessed with one child. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past seven years. On her farm, she grows maize, keeps a dairy cow and raises poultry. Anna sells milk, eggs and maize from her farm. When she is not farming, she is off offering produce transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle. Her highest monthly expense is family. To meet these expenses and provide the best for her family, Anna often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money.<br \/><br \/>Farming gives Anna a great sense of satisfaction despite the meager income, \"I enjoy it most when I see my customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" <br \/><br \/>Her biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season usually leads to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family.<br \/><br \/>Because of this challenge, Anna formed a group and joined Juhudi, a microfinance supporting smallholder rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful). Mrembo produced milk daily, which Anna sold to a co-operative union. \"The money from milk comes regularly and it is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Anna. The money Anna got from selling the milk was adequate to repay the loan.<br \/><br \/>Today, Anne is seeking a loan to purchase another dairy cow. She is planning to transition to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Anne is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health and livelihood."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1601200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-05-11T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-10T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":46800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3383.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3434.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3561.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3622.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3720.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3845.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3924.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4048.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4138.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4250.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4387.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4483}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.07,"local_amount":3409.87,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T15:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3488.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490859993},{"amount":42.38,"local_amount":3606.47,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3689.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504287537},{"amount":40.6,"local_amount":3454.5,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3534.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570890},{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":3745.99,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3832.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054244},{"amount":43.59,"local_amount":3708.94,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3794.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547425},{"amount":45.08,"local_amount":3835.72,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3924.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680394},{"amount":51.6,"local_amount":4390.74,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4491.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624691},{"amount":52.86,"local_amount":4497.57,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4601.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193764},{"amount":189.8,"local_amount":16150.2,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16522.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823297}],"funded_date":"2014-05-12T00:31:11Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":704866,"name":"Freddy Ariel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Freddy, es un peque\u00f1o caficultor de 26 a\u00f1os de edad.

She owns a small piece of land where she lives with her 6 children. For the last 12 years, she has been growing maize on the piece of land. She has managed to make a living selling the maize grains to millers after harvest. She is also involved in other small personal businesses to make extra money. \r\n\r\nRecently, she started keeping poultry for fun. She liked the fact that she could wake up in the morning and collect eggs for her family's breakfast. She started looking at poultry as a business when she had more hens and surplus eggs for breakfast. She started selling eggs to neighbours. More neighbours kept coming wanting more and more everyday. \r\n\r\nRegina seeks a loan to purchase poultry.. She can hardly meet the demand as it is today. Her major challenge is raising funds. She was, however, referred to Juhudi Kilimo, KIVA's field partner, by a well-wisher.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Regina will grow her poultry business to the next level.

For 10 years, Regarn has been planting maize on his plot to raise his 3 children. He also owns a motorcycle for ferrying his produce to the market. He makes extra income providing transportation services to other farmers. \r\n\r\nHe enjoys growing food and serving others. He invests in relationships with his clients to encourage repeat purchases. His biggest challenge is droughts. Lack of enough rainfall has led him to losses in the past. \r\n\r\nRegarns wife keeps poultry because it is kind of a requirement in the traditional way of life. Regarn is impressed with the progress he has witnessed from starting with one chicken: They have eggs for breakfast everyday; they eat chicken every special occasion, and his wife is selling eggs to shops and hotels. \r\n\r\nRegarn is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. He knows the potential is there. He joined Juhudi Kilimo through a group called Nawanga SHG. As a group, they were taken through various trainings. \"I learned the importance of working as a team or in a group\" Regarn said. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Regarn is going to make his poultry business a success. The extra income will help him manage the high farming costs. Your loan contribution will help his family increase their income. \"I will improve the living standards of my family by buying them enough food, clothes and better education for my children.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Regarn owns the following: 'cow, bicycle, motorcycle' but does not own 'a pig, poultry, pump, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'a mosquito net, running water' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, a sewing machine, a TV, a DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Naisrun has been involved with her current business for ages and it provides her with a decent income. \r\n\r\nThis is the second microloan for Naisrun and her joint-borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

He makes pizza, something he learned when working as a kitchen helper. Now Daniel prepares pizzas and sells them from his home. The idea to start a small business came from Daniel's need to earn a higher income. His wage working as a helper was not enough and his family needed certain things. With his savings, Daniel was able to buy an oven that allowed him to prepare a very small number of pizzas but, with their sales, he is able to cover basic household costs. This was his most urgent goal and worry.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, Daniel's financial situation improved and he has the opportunity to expand his business. Daniel tells us that his little business gives him the opportunity to aspire and dream of bigger things. For example he wants to build big premises where he can sells his pizzas to all the city. Daniel knows, however, that this dream is something that must be achieved little by little and so he is applying for a loan in order to buy basic supplies - such as dough, pepperoni, sausages, pineapple and more - for making pizzas. Daniel hopes that this loan will result in an increase in his income, and that he will be able to save a little in order to sell his pizzas from business premises.

The lady sitting second from the right and raising her hand in the photo is one of the members, named Anadi. \r\n\r\nAnadi is 39 years old, living with her husband and five other family members. Anadi hails from a very poor, landless, illiterate Schedule Caste (SC), Below Poverty Line category. She is running a business of rope making, a procuring and selling business. This is a traditional business in her community. Previously, the people of this community used to make rope from cow and buffalo skin. Due to social restrictions and a progressive mindset, this has been replaced by plastic rope. These items are especially used for tethering domestic animals like cows, buffalo, sheep, and goats. \r\n\r\nHer family helps Anadi in all aspects of the business, from the processing to the selling of products in different weekly markets at her locality. Her entire family works 8-10 hours daily in making these items. Her husband covers six weekly markets in a week by using public transport and a bicycle for selling the products. Her husband collects raw materials (empty cement bags) from different contractors and builders. \r\n\r\nIn a week, her family earns 2,000-4,000 INR, which is not sufficient to manage her family. So, Anadi wants to increase her income by adding some extra stock of empty cement bags and a self-transport facility. She wants to have enough stock for supporting her business to run for long days. Anadi wants to utilize the present loan for purchasing more stock of empty cement bags and procuring ready-made products from her locality.\r\n\r\nAnadi dreams to have a bike for supporting the transporting and marketing of her products, as per her own sweet-will. She also wants to complete her half-constructed house. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of her group are Tuni, Jasoda and Jaemati, who belong to the same community and are doing the similar businesses of rope making and selling. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1601199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more stock of empty cement bags and procure ready-made products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Barpadar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-05-12T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-11T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tuni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaemati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":52000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-13T15:47:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":708046,"name":"Phal's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phal is 40 years old and married.

man and the father of a numerous family. He and his wife have 7 children, for whom they rise each day to search for food and to offer a proper education so that they may become someone in life. And this is how such farmers are characterized, as humble and hard-working people, who always place the well-being of their families above their own.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Benjamin needs a loan to purchase pigs which he expects to increase his capital and be able to offer a university education to one of his children who will begin a new epoch. Benjamin's greatest dream is to be able to see all his children with good jobs, caring for their families. He hopes they will always remember their place of birth and not lose their humility.

Her grandmother passed on all of her knowledge to Carmen since she was a girl, managing to turn her into an expert in the preparation of the dish.
