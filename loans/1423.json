So she wants to purchase one more cow.\r\n\r\nShe has come to know about BJS (Kiva's partner) and has taken a loan from them. This will allow her to buy a cow.

With the help of his brother, Luis set up a store selling and connecting mobile phones, learning and perfecting this business with his brother's assistance. Thanks to his effort, good work and the humility and determination he puts into repairing and selling mobile phones, the store has now been open for 10 years. \r\n\r\nLuis's store sees many customers as it has a good reputation, but it is basically more of a point of repair for mobiles as he doesn't have many mobiles on offer to sell. This is the reason why Luis is applying for a loan to purchase second hand mobiles.

dom\u00e9sticos no tiene una fuente de ingreso,  ella cuida a sus dos hijos que todav\u00eda no van a la escuela por sus peque\u00f1a edad,  as\u00ed es que su familia se conforma de cuatro personas

el\u00e9ctrica,  pero el trabajo no era de agrado para la vista le hac\u00eda da\u00f1o por lo que tuvo que dejarlo, vale mencionar que hoy por hoy no tiene otra fuentes de ingresos solo de la

since his parents have scarce financial resources. His life partner attends to the household duties and does not have a source of income since she takes care of their two children who don't go to school as they are still too young. This is why Edwin is the one who works to take care of the family of four.   \r\n\r\nEdwin has worked as a farmer for five years. Before that, while he was studying he worked as an assistant in a electric welding garage, but he didn't like this work because it injured him so he had to let it go. It is important to note that for the time being Edwin does not have any other source of income except what he makes farming. The place where he works is close to his house so he can walk there. Sometimes his wife helps him with some tasks that aren't too tiring. His normal work schedule is five hours a day in the morning, though he almost always has other duties to attend to in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nEdwin is applying for a loan to buy four 200 pound bags of fertiliser which will be enough for him to fertilise 7000 square metres of corn. With this he will be assured of having legumes for his family and a good quality of life since as a farmer this work will bring him great satisfaction. \r\n\r\nDon Edwin's dreams are firstly to have a place to work, then to have a united family in the future so that his wife and children will be able to solve their problems and mostly to overcome challenges to have a more just society as well as having good health.

Given how far he lived from the school, he was unable to continue with his education. Amilcar is married; his wife looks after the household chores. The couple has four children, of whom only one still lives at home. This last child still depends completely on Amilcar and his wife; the other three are in relationships and have their own homes.\r\n\r\nAmilcar is a farmer. Thirty years ago - not long before he married - Amilcar went to live with an uncle who taught him how to grow crops. Since then he has not worked in anything but growing crops and looking after cows. The cows give a little milk which helps to feed the family. Before going into farming Amilcar was a fisherman. Amilcar works ten minutes away from his house. One son helps with the work for four hours per day, while the rest of Amilcar's children live further away.\r\n\r\nAmilcar is applying for this loan from \"Credicampo\" in order to buy five bags of 200 lb of fertiliser in order to lay on 7000 square metres of corn.\r\n\r\nAmilcar's big dream is to grow basic grains in order to feed his family and to help them to develop. In the future he would perhaps also like to build a better house as his current house is quite small.

They are on their 35th group loan with the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso in order to better meet the needs of their customers. \r\n\r\nAfou is pictured standing furthest on the left in the photo. In the Kotognogontala group, she is in the business of selling children's clothing. She plans to use her loan to purchase nearly two bundles of children's clothing from the big market where she is much sought after by her customers due to the high quality of her products. She resells them at retail from her home and in Kaboila to a customer base made up of both men and women for both cash and credit. \r\n\r\nAfou hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 35,000 francs CFA, a portion of which she will use to pay back the loan and interest, and the remainder of which she will put into savings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1602511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase children's clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kabo\u00efla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-05-13T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-12T14:00:08Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Afou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djata           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djarata             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dialia                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":101332.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677563},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":101332.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677228},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":101332.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677229},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101332.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209952}],"funded_date":"2014-05-13T19:43:40Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T16:35:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Long Phillips","image":1429530}},{"id":708438,"name":"Umazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Umazi is a married woman with one adult child.

Now she is seeking a loan to buy new types of birds to sell in order to raise her profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1602061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy new types of birds for her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"JO","country":"Jordan","town":"Wihdat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31 36","type":"point"}},"partner_id":185,"posted_date":"2014-05-13T14:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-12T14:00:25Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fayzeh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"JOD","disbursal_amount":1285,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":159.62,"local_amount":112.39,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":113.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504312952},{"amount":454.21,"local_amount":319.81,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":321.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517594662},{"amount":151.4,"local_amount":106.6,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":107.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542571408},{"amount":151.4,"local_amount":106.6,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":107.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561703442},{"amount":151.4,"local_amount":106.6,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":107.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579640258},{"amount":151.4,"local_amount":106.6,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":107.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595216907},{"amount":151.4,"local_amount":106.6,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T11:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":107.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612199566},{"amount":454.17,"local_amount":319.8,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":321.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636350747}],"funded_date":"2014-06-11T03:53:32Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:44:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":708451,"name":"Mlongo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mlongo is a married woman with four school-going children.

who always strives to improve her living conditions and relies on a better tomorrow, needs financial support. Her name is Mehriniso. She is 51 years old. She is married and is raising 3 children. As she lives in the countryside, she has a great opportunity to develop her business of cattle breeding.

She decided to open this store because there had not been a store in the area and she saw the need of having one there, but she has also been farming for 2 years.

After graduating from school, Mohira was unable to enroll in university due to financial difficulties. At the age of 19, she learned the seamstress profession and independently began her own sewing business which she continues to this day. For two years already, Mohira has been sewing women's ethnic Tajik-style dresses on an old, manual sewing machine. She wants to expand her business and take more orders but she needs to replace and upgrade her sewing machine to do so.

luchar junto al esposo, para que la hija este bien y poderle brindar una buena educaci\u00f3n. \nCindy se dedicaba a trabajar como impulsadora, ella se considera que hace las cosas bien, puesto que no le gusta la mediocridad.  \nElla siempre le hab\u00eda gustado la cosmetolog\u00eda y est\u00e9tica integral y decidi\u00f3 que como la hija entraba al colegio este a\u00f1o ella tambi\u00e9n iba estudiar, ya  que ten\u00eda la ma\u00f1ana libre, porque la hija se iba a estudiar y ella trabajaba en la tarde.\nFinalmente se  matriculo y ahora est\u00e1 estudiando feliz por era lo que ella

One of them is to become a cosmetologist. She lives with her daughter Nicole and husband Arturo in a happy home but there are some anguish and fights like any normal home. She is an enterprising woman who likes to work hard alongside her husband so that they can provide a good education to their daughter.\r\nCindy was working as a salesperson. She likes to do things right because she does not like mediocrity. \r\nShe has always liked cosmetology and esthetics and decided to enter school this year because her daughter was also going to school. Cindy had the morning off because her daughter went off to school and then she worked in the afternoon. \r\nShe finally enrolled and is now happy with her studies because it is what she has always wanted but had not done because she had to work and save. Her other dream is to have her own home but she is not pursuing that dream.\r\nShe was saving money in order to study and continued saving. First, she wanted to study and then excel and be a woman with good work experience and an education. \r\nUnfortunately, Cindy lost her job after enrolling in school and it has been very hard financially because cosmetology, while not having as expensive tuition as other students, requires many materials. Her husband supports her but Cindy is conscious of the costs of their home, her daughter's education, and her tuition. All of these expenses require money, not to mention all of their periodic expenses. That's why she requested the loan agreement with Kiva. She is not discouraged, she will go ahead with her studies and get a job to help at home.

Jyotsna is a housewife who attended school until grade eight, but could not study further as her parents could not afford the expenses.\r\n\r\nJyotsna's husband Keshab, 46 years old, is a labourer in a factory. To earn more for his family, he is also engaged in a fishery business. He catches fish from his pond and sells them in the local market.  They have their own pond where they raise fish.  Jyotsna helps her husband sell the fish in the market.  The demand for fish in the region is very high, as it is consumed by most of the people.  This is the only source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nJyotsna is requesting a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, to purchase fingerlings to grow more fish in their pond. She will use a portion of her loan to buy fishing net and insecticides to prevent the fish from decaying. She thinks that this will help her to strengthen the business and respond to the clients' demands.  She hopes to earn more profit to give steady financial help to her family.\r\n\r\nShe wants to get ahead with her business and she wants to thank her lenders (BJS and Kiva) for the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1601852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy fingerlings, fishing net and insecticides ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-05-13T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-12T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jyotsna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-15T18:36:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":708598,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is 41 years old, married and has four children, one of whom is still in school.

She wants to increase the product items she sells, however, due to shortage of money, she cannot afford to do so. Therefore, she wants to avail another loan from Kiva to stock up and refill the shop. \r\n\r\nWith Manneikim's first loan, she purchased a refrigerator and used it for her business. It tremendously helped her in her business, says Manneikim. She also has a desire to send her children to a good school to get a decent career and become somebody in their lives. She appreciates and thanks Kiva for helping her and her group.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group run a pan shop, sell vegetables, run a grocery shop, and run a tea stall, etc.\r\n   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1601844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy items like cold drinks, chips, biscuits, pan, etc., for the store to sell for more profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-05-13T21:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-12T21:20:09Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moinu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vungneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niangzahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngailamchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-29T23:55:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":708342,"name":"Mafuza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mafuza is from Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.

Two of their children are receiving education, and the third one is too small.\r\n\r\nThe income from Mafuza's husband\u2019s agribusiness is very scanty, so Mafuza is also engaged in a dairy business.

For the past three years, Rosemary has been working hard to manage her hair salon business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rosemary has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy chemicals, braids and dryers, and will help Rosemary generate greater profits and pay school fees. Rosemary hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nRosemary is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Kamuyati has been working hard to manage business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Kamuyati has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes and will help Kamuyati generate greater profits and pay school fees for her siblings. Kamuyati hopes that in the future she will be able to start up a retail shop. \r\n\r\nKamuyati is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Christine has been working hard to manage her local brew business, which sells beer and local brew. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more millet and sorghum for brewing, and will help Christine to generate greater profits and provide basic needs for the family. Christine hopes that in the future she will be able to start up a retail shop. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She is a member of Victory Group, Kikuyu. She lost her husband in a fire accident, which had been caused by a kerosene stove at their home. She was left with three children to take care of. Two of them are in high school, while the other is in the nearby primary school. \n\nShe uses kerosene and firewood to light and cook at her home, since she has no know-how of other available options. VEP officials, through her group, went to her home and advised her about the biogas plant, since she has pigs, chickens and three dairy cattle that she depends on for a living. She gets around 30 litres of milk from her cows which she sells at ksh 54 per litre. She takes the milk to the dairy every morning. She also sells her chickens and pigs a few months after delivery.\n\nThe biogas plant will enable her to use the gas for light and for cooking at her home. It will also help her save a lot from kerosine and also improve her vegetable-farming project, which she started recently.\n \nSince biogas plant will enable her cut the cost of buying kerosine and firewood, that savings and the income from the sale of vegetables and milk will enable her service the loan at ease.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":910.49,"image":{"id":1591197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Elina hopes that in the future she will be able to own a plot of land. \r\n\r\nElina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Muwanuzi has been working hard to manage her drugstore (pharmacy), which sells drugs of different kinds. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Muwanuzi has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more tablets, capsules, and injections, and will help Muwanuzi  to generate greater profits and provide basic needs for the family. Muwanuzi hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nMuwanuzi is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Monica hopes that in the future, she will be able to open up a big restaurant. \r\n\r\nMonica is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1602431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable

She is single and lives with her mother, and one sister and brother. The idea to be a businesswoman was born when Melissa desired to finish and strengthen her education. She began to sell clothes that a distributer brings her from the United State so she wouldn't have to ask her mother for money. With the first loan, she managed to travel to Mexico to bring merchandise. She bought quite a bit; each time, the business grew more. She has managed to contribute more money to the household and she finished her English course.\r\n\r\nShe currently travels four times a year to Mexico and wants to start travelling to New York because her clientele needs different designs for each season of the year. She can get them at a lower price there, so her profits will improve. She started this business five years ago. She currently has 142 loyal customers, who request clothes, make-up, hair products, shoes and even appliances. She wants this loan to buy new merchandise that they are asking for. \r\n\r\nShe is still studying; now she is taking an accounting course because she wants to be better prepared when she goes to the university. She recently achieved one of her dreams; she bought a motorcycle in cash. She also has shelves and racks to hang the clothes. She appreciates the support that Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer gave her with the previous loan and promises to continue to have an excellent payment standard."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1723.92,"image":{"id":1597550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy merchandise that her clients order from her.

She is someone who always liked to study and is very responsible. In 2013, she already knew exactly what she wanted to study: to be a nursing assistant. \r\n\r\nOne day, she was going down the street when she heard a series of programs that came from an institution. So she decided to go there to get more information about the nursing assistant program. She found out what she could and decided to study for this technical degree there. The day of her induction arrived and that is how she started. \r\n\r\nShe elected this program because she likes to help people a lot when they have a need, such as health. And she is always willing to help whoever needs it when she can. She loves this profession, helping people is something she has always had in mind. She wanted to study medicine but because of her mother's budget, who is the person that supports her in everything, she chose something that was of lower value. \r\n\r\nOne year and two months later, she is in her third semester to be a Nursing Assistant and is doing her internship. She has learned so many things, like the value of life, of the material things that she has, of her family and of the people in her everyday life.

The loan will be used to buy chemicals, braids and dryers, and will help Grolia to generate greater profits and use the profits to build a house. Grolia hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a supermarket. <br \/><br \/>Gloria is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

His wife takes care of the household chores.  He lives with his parents and 6 other people. Jos\u00e9 has worked in farming since he was small, having learned his trade from his father. He has been growing corn and beans for 10 years and has a one-hour walk along trails as there is no road access to where he lives.
