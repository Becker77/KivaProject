She is interested in buying and reselling cattle. She knows how to take care of livestock since she has a dairy cow and a calf. Gulrukhsor is applying for a loan to buy four calves.

Her income from this small business is good, but not enough to develop it; most of what she earns goes to the expenses of her family. Therefore, she applied for a loan of GHS 3,000 from ID-Ghana in order to purchase more jewelry, African fabric, and lace to sell. \r\n\r\nGetrude looks forward to expanding her business and providing herself and daughter with better living conditions.

For the past four years, Viola has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soft drinks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Viola has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more drinks, and will help Viola generate greater profits and open another business type. Viola hopes that in the future she will be able to operate a saloon by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nViola is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past three years, Carol has been working hard to manage her retail business selling charcoal, fruit, and vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Carol has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal and fruits and will help Carol generate greater profits and increase her capital. Carol hopes that in the future she will be able to open a saloon. \r\n\r\nCarol is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Sharot has been working hard to manage her brick laying business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sharot has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy wood and water and also pay for more labor, and will help Sharot generate greater profits and improve her capital. Sharot hopes that in the future she will be able to construct a house. \r\n\r\nSharot is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

This business cost them a lot of money. Unfortunately, they couldn't purchase windows for the rooms, kitchen, and bathroom of the house. This thing makes the rain, sunshine, flies, fireflies, and bad bugs come into the house and cause sickness for the family. \r\n\r\nRecently, they needed financial support to prepare the house to become in a good condition and more safe. As a result, Amat Al-Ghani is requesting a loan of 40,000 YER from AMB.

She lives with her sister, who took responsibility for her from the moment their mother died. They have been able to reach goals to which they have set their mind together. Carolina stands out for her great talent as a ballerina, especially Costa Rican folklore, with which she has succeeded in representing our country in the five countries in which she has danced, winning first place in the competition. She wants this loan in order to finish her university course, since she has reached the last subjects to complete her study plan. She started working six years ago. The initiative came from the moment she saw her sister had a lot of work and that she had to finish a very large order in an established period of time. Her sister taught her and from this moment she continues to help her. Although they started with little working capital, currently they have the machines necessary to bind books and a room that they fitted out as a workshop.

","en":"Munavvara recently turned 27 years old.  She is a native of the Shahrituz district. Munavvara is married to a security guard. She teaches at the local village school. At the present time, Munavvara and her husband are planning to start their own family business in animal husbandry. They decided to get involved in fattening up and selling cattle, a business for which their district has all of the necessary conditions. Their village has a good pasture for livestock. Unfortunately, they do not enough of their own capital to achieve their goal. This is why Munavvara requested this loan to buy four heads of cattle. She hopes that they will get the chance to start their own business and solve the family's financial problems.

They have a small kachha house there (mud, bamboo and straw-made).  Both Renubala and her husband are illiterate and can only sign their names. Their son is in school in grade 10.\r\n\r\nRenubala's husband Jogen, aged 57 years, has been engaged in agricultural activities for ten years.  He has an inherited plot of land where he grows potatoes, beans and other vegetables.  He sells the produce in the local markets and earns income for the family's livelihood.  But the income from this business is too scanty to give the family enough financial sustenance.  To help her husband and to generate additional income for her family, Renubala started animal husbandry.  She has a milk cow and she sells milk in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business she wants to purchase a cow and for that, she needs money.

Despite traditional roles and cultural norms in her town, she entered the commercial world of men to open her grocery store at the age of 49.

He hopes that this strategy will be positive and bring customers to his center.\r\n\r\nHe cannot act upon his strategy without some capital, so he requested a Kiva loan of 500,000 YER through Kiva's field partner AMB to purchase a car battery charger and a motor generator. \r\n\r\nAdel is married and he looks after his children and aging parents, but he hardly spends time with them due to his business.  Adel looks forward to opening another center. He hopes to provide his family with a lot of money.

Rudianto explains himself how and why he became a reseller of Nazava water filters: \u201cOne of the basic daily needs for all living beings, in this world is water. Without water, there is no possibility of life in the world.\nUnfortunately, clean water is not available everywhere, in the area where I live there is no access to clean water.  Therefore, we buy large bottles (19 L) of mineral water for our daily drinking water needs. These bottles get ever more expensive. We never buy drinking water at so-called refill stations because the water does not meet drinking water standards.\nI found out about Nazava by chance in November 2013, not long after that the 4th of December 2013, I submitted a request to become a Nazava reseller. Why did I directly apply to become a reseller? Why not try out the product first?  to find out if it really works?\nIt is the excellence of the product and the foundation on which Nazava is based, namely, for the benefit of humanity all over the world, that made me take the decision to become a reseller directly. Hopefully, later on, Nazava water filters will be present in each and every house in my area\nAlso without Nazava I have enough to do in my live, 24 hours in a day feels inadequate. But that is just for me. Should I close the door when there is an opportunity that can positively affect many lives if I take it? There is a series of words that I am aware of from the Prophet Muhammad: The best of men are the most useful to others\nTherefore, God willing, together with I Nazava I can do more for the benefit of the people, amen. \u201c\nWith this loan Rudianto, can buy up to 200 filters which help hem provide safe drinking water to around 1000 people. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1600866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy up to 200 filters which help him provide safe drinking water and benefit the people of Riau, Sumatra","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kuantan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2014-05-14T22:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-13T22:00:16Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rudianto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":22000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4400000},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":385,"local_amount":4400000,"processed_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-21T09:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4439542.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517595493},{"amount":385,"local_amount":4400000,"processed_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4439542.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530091258},{"amount":1155,"local_amount":13200000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":13318628.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542572404}],"funded_date":"2014-05-17T15:18:36Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T16:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":706948,"name":"Wahyu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Wahyu lives in Yogyakarta, in the heart of Java, the most populous Island of Indonesia.

Being far from any urban area, access is difficult. Luis makes a living producing coffee.\r\n\r\nLuis is an entrepreneur who believes that adversities are just part of a process of prospering and making his little business better. Working with a Fairtrade certificate has helped Luis to improve production and management of his coffee, and this has resulted in an increase in the quality and price of his coffee.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Luis has increased production by 50%. This has motivated him to continue improving his farm and production. As part of these improvements, Luis is applying for a loan to look after his coffee.

With this loan, he hopes to purchase some calves to fatten and bring to the proper weight. The idea is to take advantage of the pasture space that he has, and the good land and climate conditions, to be able to have these animals and later make a little profit by selling the fattened cattle for meat. With this purchase, he will be able to establish another line of work and also have savings that will allow him to have more and more animals and invest more in his plan for the property.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that he has received from Fudecosur. He hadn't ever received other loans from state banks, but Fudecosur has given him this loan more easily and with a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1598351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase calves for fattening","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Pueblo Nuevo, Rivas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2014-05-15T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-14T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":476,"local_amount":259638.35,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":262754.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231336},{"amount":74,"local_amount":40361.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":40845.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557789}],"funded_date":"2014-05-18T12:16:43Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:51:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Frank","image":null}},{"id":709122,"name":"Narcisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narcisa works hard to support her family.

It is part of a family tradition, being the only source of income for generations, which has allowed them to cover the household expenses.  She learnt the trade from her parents at 13, and has continued learning with her husband who also works in the same line of work.  Her husband has his own plot of land which he inherited from his parents.\r\n\r\nDilmar could not finish her studies due to the financial difficulties that her parents had at the time.  She only managed to complete four years of her education because her parents did not earn enough income to support her.  She has three children from her relationship who all attend high school in the area and help their parents with some activities in the fields.\r\n\r\nHer goals this year are to get 100% production from her plantations so she can get a good harvest and make progress little by little, generating more income each year in the process.  As a mother her desire is to support her children through their education so that they can prepare themselves academically to have more opportunities in life with several ways of making a living.  \r\n\r\nFor this reason she is asking for a loan from COMIXMUL so she can buy agricultural supplies to care for her coffee plantations and have the best results at the end of the season.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":737.5,"image":{"id":1598366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies which will help her protect her coffee plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-05-15T05:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-14T05:40:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilma Araceli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":725.68,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14104.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.82,"payment_id":624827090}],"funded_date":"2014-06-14T05:39:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":709131,"name":"Vivencia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vivencia works hard to support her family.

More than ten years' experience has earned her an excellent reputation among the residents of the area, but these people aren't her main sales niche, because her town is known as a tourism destination. That is why every year, in season, she has to find a way to attract customers with her new and interesting hand made objects. But these aren't the only products that she sells. She also distributes traditional Colombian clothing, especially Antioquian, such as carriels, hats, ruanas, espadrilles and more. Her main dream is to be able to continue with the tradition of selling hand made crafts so she can keep this beautiful tradition, because thanks to her they are remodeling and enlarging their home. That is why she decided to spend the rest of her life making these beautiful artistic pieces. as a mother, she also has to care for her son, who is 10 years old. She wants to give him a good education and future to be able to send him to college. For that reason, she is asking for a loan to buy raw materials to make the hand made crafts to continue growing her business, to do home improvements and to give her son a future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":1598422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy raw materials to make handmade crafts, such as wood, shiny items, vinyl and more.

The money that she accumulates is not enough for that and most of what she earns goes to the expenses of her family. For this reason, she applied for a loan of 30,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more women's clothes and resell them to her customers.

Not only this but they are grounded in a spiritual aspect says Regina, the leader of the group, as not only in religion do we have to act in the best manner possible to keep all the doors open. Also the words are important for Regina, Ma Rutila, Roxana y Cristina in order to become a perfect and united group which has allowed them to continue together and reap the benefits that that union gives them. <br \/><br \/>VisionFund has motivated their clients to continue with their businesses so they can generate the resources they need to have a better quality of living and more importantly benefit the children of the members. Regina is a very enthusiastic leader, hard-working and with many dreams. So the other members of the group elected her as the representative of the\u201cCebada y Trigo\u201d group. She says that she learned about the organization and the loan payments that are adapted to their clients from her sister. <br \/><br \/>Regina who is in the front part of the photo has a special taste for fashion. A few years ago she studied a fashion design course but for financial reasons she could not carry out one of her dreams, which is to make tradition clothing used in dancing to exhibit national folklore. But it is never too late to start. She now has a sewing machine and in her spare time she makes clothing. When she has an order she fills it with much love and dedication. She will use the credit to buy fabric, buttons, zippers and other material to continue with her work. <br \/><br \/>On the other hand, Rutilia is the head of her household. She says she no longer lives with her husband and she puts more effort into providing the best for her family, which is her 17 year old son who is still studying. She wants to offer a better quality of living to her son and with the loan will continue to raise calves. Roxana despite her young age, has seen that life is not easy and has had to find out how to sustain herself. Her marriage is approaching and she radiates with happiness as she waits with some anxiety the arrival of the greatest gift that there is on earth, a child. She wants to give it the best when she holds it in her arms. Thanks to the loan she can buy lambs and start raising animals. Then she won't have to worry about taking care of her guests that will share such an important date with her and her husband. Finally Cristina wants to help with the household expenses, mentions that VisionFund has given her a hand in starting her business of selling clothes. Before she had a small stand with little variety in clothing but with the loan she can buy more merchandise that her clients want. So they are all putting their confidence in getting ahead thanks to your help and their effort."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":1597603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric, buttons, zippers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Purisima Concepcion Mayorazgo, San Felipe del Prog","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-05-15T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-14T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Regina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Rutilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":43000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3480.93},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3816.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3946.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4140.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4381.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4558.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4806.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5018.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":5265.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":338.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":371.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":388.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":407.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":269.16,"local_amount":3480.93,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T20:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3501.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490986616},{"amount":277.11,"local_amount":3583.77,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3604.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504427547},{"amount":295.11,"local_amount":3816.57,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3839.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705232},{"amount":305.2,"local_amount":3947.01,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3970.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530255671},{"amount":320.18,"local_amount":4140.44,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4164.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690488},{"amount":338.84,"local_amount":4381.94,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4407.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561823478},{"amount":342.02,"local_amount":4558.97,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4585.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.51,"payment_id":579807693},{"amount":366.69,"local_amount":4806.64,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4835.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.99,"payment_id":595349806},{"amount":373.67,"local_amount":5021.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5050.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.61,"payment_id":611980549},{"amount":375.95,"local_amount":5262.4,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5293.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.96,"payment_id":624423727}],"funded_date":"2014-05-20T00:22:16Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":709204,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is married with five children who go to school.
