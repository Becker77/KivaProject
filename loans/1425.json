She has requested a loan of UGX 1,000,000 from MCDT- SACCO to enable her to buy 20 bags of charcoal for sale. Her challenge includes transportation. Her dream is to buy a piece of land and do away with paying rental dues for the stall in the market where she operates. She joined MCDT because she failed to get financial assistance from relatives. She stays with her husband in a rented house with access to electricity but no piped water.  Her major monthly expenses include school dues and rent."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1603264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Eastern Kenya. She produces and sells milk, tea, and a variety of crops. She also has a motorbike that she uses to transport her produce to the market and to offer transportation services to the locals in the area.

Pedro is 54 years old and is a farmer with over 40 years of experience. Since he was small he helped his father cultivate corn, beans, and wheat to sustain his family. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t go to college but since starting in farming he has been able to start and buy, little by little, with his savings, land to cultivate in order to become independent and provide a better life for his 5 children and wife. \r\n\r\nNow, with the help of his children and assistants, Pedro sells his products in the rural community where he lives. At the end of the harvest, he travels seasonally to Costa Rica to pick coffee and thus continue growing. However, he needs a loan to purchase fertilizer and to pay his assistants for cultivating corn and beans which is about to begin. Pedro believes that with the help of the loan he will be able to purchase his materials to be able to hold his harvest in the storage containers expected this season and be able to sell it earlier at a better price. This will allow him to pay on time and request a loan later on to drill a well on his farm.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1598644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer and to pay his assistants for cultivating corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-05-15T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-14T18:20:17Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695629},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649616830}],"funded_date":"2014-06-13T14:56:58Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T14:02:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diana Lima","image":830085}},{"id":706324,"name":"Elmer Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elmer de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta 3\u00ba grado, esta casado, su esposa trabaja vendiendo ropa en los pueblos, son padres de dos hijos menores de 9 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, que estudian. \n\nElmer trabaja como empleado, tambien con ganado tiene nueve a\u00f1os de dedicarse a este negocio y lo aprendio del suegro y se dedico a esto para forjarse un mejor futuro para sus hijos; asi tambien se dedican a vender ropa en los pueblos no habia otro negocio antes, viaja en bus y se involucra la esposa y su horario es variado porque los dias libres son los que se dedica a la actividad de vender ropa. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitandoa CREDICAMPO, es para comprar ganado de repasto, le mejorara ya que esta trabajando por mejorar su condicion y calidad de vida. \n\n Sus sue\u00f1os son seguir trabajando lo mejor que se pueda, y en cuanto a su familia que estudien y se preparen academicamente.

Marika couldn\u2019t request a loan from financial institutions until the start up program began, which is a joint product of Kiva and Credo. She requested a loan of 1,100 USD to begin trading in clothing and bedclothes. She plans to go to Turkey and purchase the products at wholesale prices and then resell them among her friends and villagers.

She has 3 children; two have their own homes, and only one son lives with her but is not dependent.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business is a cafe, which she's been working in for a year.  She got the idea from a friend that encouraged her to go into the business, and she decided to do it to support herself financially.   She also hand-washes clothing for pay.  She had never had a business before.  The cafe is in her house and she goes a kilometer away by foot to the place where she washes clothes.  There's no one else involved with her business.  She does the washing from 6AM to 10AM and works in the cafe from 11AM to 6PM.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Mar\u00eda is seeking is to buy candy, soft drinks, dairy products, and desserts to sell in the cafe.

In 1999, Lauratu established her \"gara\" (locally dyed) textiles business. She began this business because she wanted to be self-employed and believed that she could earn enough income to help her husband provide a livelihood for their family. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, Lauratu earns about 442,600 SLL a month. She makes good quality \"gara\" clothing and does her business by public transport twice in a month. \r\n\r\nLauratu is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 SLL, which she will use to buy \"brilliant\" fabric and quality dye. She is planning to acquire a strategic spacious business place. During the rainy season sales are normally slow and production of gara clothing is small. Though the sales are sometimes slow, she has loyal customers from different towns who buy large quantities of goods.\r\n\r\nLauratu used the proceeds of her last loan to provide a livelihood for her family and pay school fees for her children. She did not encounter any major problem in repaying the loan. She was not able to start the planned house construction because she did not make enough profit to do so. She still plans to construct a house, open a saving account, pay her way for a pilgrimage to Mecca (Holy Land), and support her children's education. Lauratu is very determined and hopes to continue working hard to pay off her loans so that she can access more loans.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1602668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fabric and dye for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2014-05-15T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-14T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lauratu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":834000},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":834000},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":834000},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":834000},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":834000},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":830000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":195.99,"local_amount":834000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T09:47:25Z","rounded_local_amount":850282.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490748824},{"amount":195.99,"local_amount":834000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":850282.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504177523},{"amount":195.99,"local_amount":834000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":850282,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462162},{"amount":195.99,"local_amount":834000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":850282,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529946177},{"amount":195.99,"local_amount":834000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":850282,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542439487},{"amount":195.05,"local_amount":830000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T09:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":846203.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561577227}],"funded_date":"2014-05-16T18:49:59Z","paid_date":"2015-03-10T09:54:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":706342,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosalinda de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, por motivos de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos no pudo continuar con sus estudios, y decidi\u00f3 dedicarse al trabajo de elaboraci\u00f3n de alimentos.

","en":"Idimoh is a resident of the rural Khuroson District. She practices crop farming there. She is married to a foreman who does home repairs. They have three children. Their oldest daughter is 8 years old, their other daughter is 3 years old and their youngest son is 1 year old. They live modestly but happily. On her small plot of arable land, Idimoh grows garden crops. At this very moment, she is preparing for the next round of sowing. As her personal funds are not enough to buy seeds and mineral fertilizers, Idimoh requested a loan. She hopefully awaits financial support in order to successfully finish her sowing work.

His parents encouraged him to go back to school but he refused. He dreamed of being a miner like his father and hoped to become rich at an early age. Several years later he realized that the decision he made was not a good one. He joined his elder sister's husband in business, where he made commissions from good business transactions and saved to set up his own little business. Through hard work and commitment he was able to have his own petty business. Years of experience in business has helped him improve a lot. He is hoping to concentrate on strengthening his business and taking good care of his children. He has one major competitor that is a challenge to his business, though they are in cordial relation. He is a hardworking and honest businessman. He thanks ARD, as the loan will help him buy goods that are in great demand.

The communal bank is made up of a number of people who are constantly looking for opportunities to get ahead and, with their daily hard work, to give a better future to their children.  The other members of the communal bank make their livings in agriculture, selling wood, clothing sales, selling food, raising small animals, building houses etc.   The members are all grateful for the opportunity being offered, and they promise to each pay back their loans in their individually established time frames.  (Patria is known for its products from the jungle as well as its lodging and restaurants.  It is the point of entry to Manu National Park)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4300,"image":{"id":1599083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase compost.

She is married and has 4 children.  In 2006, Adama established her groundnut business. She began her business because she was raised farming.  After she got married, her elder sister gave her some money to start bread business. She later changed the business to selling groundnuts because of poor sales and low income.  By working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan of Le 5,000,000.

She is an uneducated woman, but she is very dynamic and vigorous. She works as a cleaner in a private factory and a private school. The salary that she receives from her job is small and not enough to cover all the expenses of the family. Unfortunately, their house is very old, and it is likely to fall down at any time. It needs to be renovated, which requires a lot of money, but Rifat doesn't have enough money to do that. As a result, Rifat is requesting a loan of 70,000 YER from AMB. She will use the loan to purchase construction materials such as cement and bricks in order to make a quick renovation of the house.\r\n\r\nRifat looks forward to renovating all of her house and

25 a\u00f1os.\nLa mayor parte de la vida laboral la ha dedicado al cuidado calificado de los ni\u00f1os y las ni\u00f1as en la primera infancia, es docente de profesi\u00f3n y la labor la realizo con mucho amor y dedicaci\u00f3n hasta hace dos a\u00f1os, pues las complicaciones a nivel de salud la obligaron a retirarse de esta actividad, que constantemente le implicaban agacharse, arrodillarse y estar al nivel de los ni\u00f1os para alzarlos, mimarlos, y alimentarlos entre otras de las necesidades b\u00e1sicas.\nElla hubiese querido continuar con esta labor, pues las satisfacciones que ha recibido a nivel personal y el crecimiento espiritual han sido la  mejor paga.\nAura ha trabajado desde muy ni\u00f1a y ninguno de los retos propuestos los ha dejado de lado, uno de ellos ha sido convertirse en empresaria de un centro de est\u00e9tica y generar empleo, la idea de trabajar para terceros ya no est\u00e1 dentro de los planes, por ello ha decidido emprender una nueva etapa en la vida que no impliquen riesgos o compliquen m\u00e1s el estado de salud.\nSin embargo la mayor preocupaci\u00f3n  es buscar el recurso econ\u00f3mico que le permita estudiar en una instituci\u00f3n con reconocimiento a nivel nacional COSMETOLOG\u00cdA Y EST\u00c9TICA, raz\u00f3n por la cual desde el inicio del a\u00f1o se dio a la tarea de buscar una entidad que le permitiera pagar cuotas moderadas aunque con gran esfuerzo deber\u00e1 recaudar.\nAura ha recurrido a un m\u00e9todo muy eficiente que no implica pago de intereses y es muy conocido por la mayor\u00eda de las personas el ahorro en la alcanc\u00eda (la meta diaria es m\u00ednimo 500 pesos)  con el dinero recaudado logro vincularse a CAMPO ALTO, ya que lleno todas las expectativas.\n\nElla sabe que debe cohibirse de muchas cosas, como comerse un helado, comprarse unos buenos zapatos, salir con la familia, dejar de compartir con ellos, pero tambi\u00e9n sabe que cuenta con el apoyo y respaldo en todas las decisiones,  as\u00ed que en un tiempo no muy lejano encontrara  un nuevo centro de est\u00e9tica.\nElla solicita el convenio de kiva ya que con los ahorros que ella hace no le alcanza lo suficiente para poder realizar los pagos m\u00e1s los gastos mensuales que esta carrera le implica, con el subsidio de kiva podr\u00eda seguir haciendo el mismo ahorro pero con la plata que  ella no gastar\u00eda en el pago mensual la puede utilizar en los implemento que necesite en el estudio.   \n","en":"This is Aura, a happily married woman of 25 years and hardworking mother of two children.\r\n\r\nThe most part of her working life has been in taking care of young children up to 6 years as a teacher and does her work with a lot of love and dedication. Two years ago she was forced to retire due to health complications, being that she could not physically meet the constant need to bend down, and kneel, to the level of the children to lift, pamper, and nurture and feed them among other basic needs. She would have liked to continue with this work since the satisfaction she received on the personal and spiritual growth has been the best pay. \r\n\r\nAura has worked since she was a little girl and no challenge has ever deterred her; this one being that she has decided to reinvent herself and become a business owner of a beauty and esthetics center and generate work. The idea of working for a third party is not in her plans, for this she has decided to embark on a new stage in her life that will not further implicate risks or complicate the state of her health.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the biggest concern is looking for the economic resource that permits her to study in a nationally recognized institution for Cosmetology and Esthetics. Since the beginning of the year her task was to find an organization that would allow her to pay just moderate fees for the great effort it takes to raise the funds.\r\n\r\nAura has turned to an efficient method that does not involve interest payments and is very well known through the majority of people involved in savings; (The daily goal is a minimum of 500 pesos) all the money collected is to benefit CampoAlto, since it has met all expectations. \r\n\r\nShe knows that will have to refrain from many things, like going to get ice cream, buying herself some nice shoes, going with the family or sharing other things. She also can count on their support and backing in all her decisions. This way, in a short time she will find a new focus in cosmetology and esthetics. \r\n\r\nShe seeks the loan agreement with Kiva because her savings alone are not sufficient to be able to pay the monthly tuition expenses for schooling. With the help of Kiva she will be able to keep using her savings to pay for what is necessary for her studies, rather than the monthly payments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1597719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is 34-year-old Hellen from Harare. She is married with three children, two of whom are attending school. Hellen runs a retail business selling clothes and groceries. The business has been in operation for six years. She says the main challenges she faces are stiff competition and the risk of accidents when traveling on long journeys to South Africa. Hellen has requested a loan of $400 to purchase fabrics for sewing. Hellen purchased groceries from South Africa for resale in the community with the previous loan. This enabled the client to make improved profits. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to send her child to a university and improve the general upkeep of the family. In the future, Hellen plans to extend her business to other towns by opening more

With his experience in this field, he has earned the wholesalers' community's trust.\r\n\r\nYacouba stocks up on merchandise in Sikasso and in Loulouni, and resells at retail in his shop in Kai to a customer base made up of both men and women for cash and credit. In order to better meet the ever-growing needs of his customer base, Yacouba is requesting his ninth loan through the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso. This ninth loan will allow him to purchase 5 bags of 50kg of rice, 4 bags of 50kg of sugar, 2 barrels of 20 liters of oil, 2 boxes of candy, 3 cartons of cigarettes, 1 box of tea and 2 boxes of Maggi cubes.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Yacouba hopes to earn an average monthly income of 190,000 francs CFA. With his profits, he plans to provide for his personal expenses, contribute to his family's expenses, pay back the loan and its interest, and invest the rest in his

He earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. He will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory.\r\n\r\nSaturnino hopes that his business will grow bigger and dreams that his child will finish college. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

From this business, he became a professional young man. He could accumulate a good amount of money, and then he started his own business by opening a barbershop in the center of the city of Hodeidah.

The climate in Hodeidah is very hot in most of the seasons of the year, particularly in these days. Unfortunately, Acram's barbershop lacks an air conditioner. This negatively affects the attraction of more customers. Also, Acram wants to purchase a glass door for the store in order to make the barbershop very attractive for more customers.

It consists of four women who are all hard-working. They live in Hodeidah, Yemen. They have taken a loan of 120,000 YER. \r\n\r\nBaraka is 39 years old and a married woman with eight children. She is the leader of the group. She is an uneducated woman, but she knows her advantages very well. She has a strong determination to improve the standards of her living. She said she had a small amount of money which she saved up herself. Baraka invested that money in her own business.

She has found that this business produces a fair income. In order to meet the needs of her many customers, and to expand the size of her business, Kassipin decided to partner with the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso more than 8 years ago. After having been a part of group loans, all of which were fully repaid, Kassipin is on her 7th individual loan and has fully repaid all her previous loans as well.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Kassipin plans to purchase barrels of oil in Koutiala in the factories. Her production is located in her home, and she sells the finished product in Bamako to a customer base made up of both men and women for cash. Kassipin hopes to earn an average monthly income of 100,000 francs CFA which she plans to use to pay back the loan and interest to Soro Yiriwaso, to provide for the daily expenses for her family, and to invest the rest back into other small revenue-generating
