With this loan, Mrs. Sitan hopes to earn an average monthly revenue of 20,000 West African francs, which will be used to cover some minor expenses for her children and strengthen her working capital.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1603341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy millet and rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Diakobougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-05-17T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-16T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiata                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":33779.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677567},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":33779.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677237},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":33779.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677238},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":33779.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530209967},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":33779.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658726},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33779.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561792924}],"funded_date":"2014-05-17T20:10:48Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:12:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":709751,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is 35 years old.

community of Nahuala.  Their area is a lush agricultural region where coffee and bananas are cultivated.  These women are strongly motivated to continue learning and growing their businesses through a third cycle of education and business advising from Namaste. Their businesses include food sales, clothing sales and coffee sales.\nManuela (second from left) is 62 years old with a husband who works as an agricultural laborer and 5 grown children.  Her business is selling coffee.  Manuela is illiterate and is very proud of the fact that the proceeds from her small business allowed all five of her children to go to school and complete their studies. During the first two loan cycles with Namaste she learned many practical ways to improve her business. She was able to expand her sales and add bananas and chili powder to the products she sells. During this third cycle she wants to add a greater variety of fruits to sell and will also start selling at a Sunday market in a neighboring town. She will invest her loan money in buying product in larger quantities at better prices.\nManuela is an outstanding member of her group. She puts all that she learns immediately into practice because she has seen how beneficial the advice of her Namaste business advisor has been to making her business more successful. Her dream now is to grow her business enough so that with the extra income she can improve their living conditions.  Her current monthly profits are about 3280 Guatemalan Quetzales; and she and her business advisor are projecting a 100% increase in profits over the next nine months.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1597618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to add a greater variety of fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nahual\u00e1, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2014-05-17T11:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-16T11:30:04Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2111.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":2111.11,"processed_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490835121},{"amount":825.01,"local_amount":6333.39,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6374.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543541},{"amount":274.99,"local_amount":2111.13,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026845},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2111.01,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542519113},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2111.11,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561652793},{"amount":361.86,"local_amount":2777.91,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2795.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581607293},{"amount":188.14,"local_amount":1444.32,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1453.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595165308}],"funded_date":"2014-05-22T21:10:30Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":698675,"name":"Shangwe Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Fran\u00e7oise femme ambitieuse bourr\u00e9e de talents et membre du groupe d\u2019affaires \u00abShangwe\u00bb, responsable, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 38 ans,  m\u00e8re de 4 enfants tous scolaris\u00e9s.

This will enable Valeria to earn money to support her family--she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she most likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she enjoys the training courses that the institution puts on.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1596701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-05-17T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-16T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":128,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bacilia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Claudia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silveria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1713.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1760.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1810.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1859.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1908.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1960.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2014.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2070.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2126.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2184.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2242.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2349.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":299.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":248.16,"local_amount":1713.92,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-19T09:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490838732},{"amount":254.97,"local_amount":1760.96,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1761.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264765},{"amount":531.35,"local_amount":3669.76,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3671.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546868},{"amount":276.38,"local_amount":1908.8,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1909.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030032},{"amount":283.84,"local_amount":1960.32,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1961.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522250},{"amount":291.62,"local_amount":2014.08,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2015,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655893},{"amount":299.73,"local_amount":2070.08,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2071.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579574895},{"amount":1288.95,"local_amount":8902.08,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8906.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168767}],"funded_date":"2014-05-21T16:31:24Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:02:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":701192,"name":"Pheap","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pheap is 33 years old.

She has a secondary education. For four years already, she has been practicing crop farming and livestock breeding. Her persistence and hard work have allowed Cholponai to develop her animal breeding business to include: 1 milk cow, 4 bull calves and 15 sheep. She and her husband also breed pedigree horses. They currently have 7 horses on their farm.  She also has a 2.40 hectare plot of land on which she annually grows potatoes, grains and sainfoin for personal consumption and sale. Their average monthly income is about 15,000 som (KGS).

They are responsible mothers and fathers with ten children under their responsibility. All of the members are from Malpaisillo, located in the northern zone of the region. Unfortunately, due to scarce financial resources, they were not able to finish school. Instead, out of necessity, they had to work in order to help their families. \r\n\r\nThanks to much hard work and the desire to get ahead, the group coordinator, Ciprana, owns a small grocery store that has items such as rice, beans, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, detergents, juices, and sodas. She makes a living working in her store 12 hours a day. The objective of this loan is to invest in working capital and to stock her business so that, in the near future, she may obtain better earnings. \r\n\r\nThe El esfuerzo group is grateful for the help that Kiva lenders offer to people who have little resources and to poor countries such as Nicaragua so that the people there may find dignified work.

Gulanda has a secondary education. Gulanda is calm, level-headed and hardworking. Her husband helps her with her business. As an additional source of income for her family, Gulanda has been practicing livestock breeding and  crop farming for many years.  Starting this business basically from nothing, thanks to Gulanda's hard work, she currently has 4 milk cows and 1 horse on her farm. She also has a 1.50 hectare plot of land on which she grows watermelon. This business brings in about 15,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and dairy products, as well as the summer watermelon season, which primarily serves to cover the food expenses and daily living needs of the family. For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulanda turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) to buy cows. Gulanda plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further expansion of her farm. She also wants to save money to build a house for her family in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1592030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-17T14:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-16T14:30:20Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":9330},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":9475},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":9752},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10036},{"due_date":"2014-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10329},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10630},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":10940},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":11259},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":11588},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":11926},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12274},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12461}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":347.17,"local_amount":18805,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T08:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":18901.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504178623},{"amount":180.04,"local_amount":9752,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-22T09:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9801.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463262},{"amount":185.28,"local_amount":10036,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10087.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947281},{"amount":190.69,"local_amount":10329,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10381.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440631},{"amount":196.24,"local_amount":10630,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10684.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578437},{"amount":201.97,"local_amount":10940,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10995.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489064},{"amount":207.83,"local_amount":11259,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":11316.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.03,"payment_id":595436252},{"amount":211.18,"local_amount":11588,"processed_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":11647.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.75,"payment_id":610751265},{"amount":214.17,"local_amount":11926,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11986.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6,"payment_id":624798966},{"amount":212.67,"local_amount":12274,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":12336.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.93,"payment_id":636161117},{"amount":230.05,"local_amount":12461,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":12524.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513529}],"funded_date":"2014-06-03T14:23:23Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":701824,"name":"Yan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yan is 63 years old.

She is originally from Chinandega, which is located in the west of the country.  She is known for being hard-working, responsible, and with a great desire for personal success.  In her free time she likes to spend quality time with her family and make them a typical dish from the region such as \"Indio viejo,\" a stew.  Due to a lack of financial resources she was not able to pursue a career and was obligated to work from a young age in order to help with household expenses.  Thanks to her spirit and her desire to get ahead she works selling general merchandise like pants, shirts, skirts, makeup, shoes, and other items.  In addition she also sells basic grains and food products in one of the markets in her town.  She makes her purchases in the markets and distributes products in another region.  Her sales are in cash and on credit, which she collects weekly.  The aim of this new loan is to invest in capital and supply the business in order to purchase merchandise and basic grains for sale so that in the future she will have better income.

She also has a 2.44 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, grains and sainfoin for personal consumption and sales to regular wholesale buyers. Additionally, Zhanyl sells cattle.This agricultural business brings in more than 10,000 som (KGS) per month. For the purpose of further developing her business, Zhanyl turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows. A portion of the loan will be spent on crop farming. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further expansion of her farm. She also wants to save money to finish the construction of her house in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1592261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sary-Kamysh village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-17T14:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-16T14:50:09Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhanyl","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":555,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-22T09:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":30215.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463263},{"amount":555,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30215.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947282},{"amount":370,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20143.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578438},{"amount":370,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":20143.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513530}],"funded_date":"2014-05-19T19:10:55Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":709815,"name":"Fulwati","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dairy cows are valuable assets, supporting the rural poor to earn a decent living.

They sell it to the neighboring households and to different tea vendors.\r\n\r\nFulwati (38) is very enterprising woman; she always looks for opportunities. She joined a local NGO called \u201cMESP\u201d, which helps villagers based in deep-rural areas who cannot access finances through banks. Fulwati attended various agri-business training sessions to be eligible for a dairy loan. The NGO also taught her about dairy cows, feed supplements, sources and contact persons for good quality semen, animal first-aid and preventive health care. \r\n\r\nFulwati is fully equipped to be a successful farmer and she is taking a further step of seeking a loan to purchase another dairy cow. Her major challenge is raising funds. Most of her income is spent paying for expensive farm inputs and her two children's school fees.\r\n\r\nThe additional income will go into converting the temporary shed to a permanent tiled-roof with enough space for each animal.

She also was able to buy a 3.0 hectare plot of land. Boronkul's monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of the further development of her business, Boronkul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. Boronkul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She is also determined to save money to increase the size of her barn and to buy a car."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1592314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aral village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-17T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-16T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.98,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boronkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-22T09:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12589.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463264},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12589.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578439},{"amount":228.27,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":12589.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.98,"payment_id":610751266},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":12589.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513531}],"funded_date":"2014-05-21T10:00:02Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":707048,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El cliente de 26 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz y adicional a esto trabaja como alba\u00f1il, tiene varios a\u00f1os de trabajar en la agricultura y ha ganado experiencia valiosa que le permite obtener las mejores cosechas, el terreno donde siembra est\u00e1 ubicado en una zona de alta incidencia agr\u00edcola y muy cercano a su vivienda, cuando su cosecha ya esta lista la almacena en los graneros que muestra la fotograf\u00eda para luego comercializarlos en todos los alrededores de la comunidad.

Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk, meat, and cattle. For the purpose of further developing her business, Ayida requested a loan from Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to buy pedigree sheep. A portion of the loan will also be spent on buying cows to increase the size of her herd. Ayida plans on investing the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

All of her children are grown-up and live separately. Her youngest son is a student. He actively helps his mother with her farming. Ryskul has a secondary education. She has a good reputation as a kind and hardworking woman. As the main source of income for her family, Ryskul practices livestock breeding. She started this business in 1990 with 500 som (KGS). Thanks to Ryskul's hardwork, she has been able to develop her farm to include 1 milk cow, 2 calves, 8 sheep, 10 goats and 1 horse. Her business brings in about 14,000 som (KGS) per month, which primarily serves to cover her family's food expenses and daily living needs. For the purpose of the further development of her business, Ryskul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy cows. Ryskul plants to invest the earnings from the loan in the further expansion of her business. She also wants to buy a house for her son in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1592903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alysh village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-17T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-16T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ryskul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":70775.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513532}],"funded_date":"2014-06-08T17:59:51Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":707492,"name":"Zoya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zoya lives in Karnut village with her husband, three children, parents-in-law and brother-in-law. \r\nThis big family runs a farm.

Ainagul has a secondary education. She is goal-driven, calm, level-headed and hardworking. As an additional source of income for her family, Ainagul has been practicing animal breeding for many years. She started this business in 1993 with a purchase of cattle. Thanks to Ainagul's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 10 sheep on her farm. Her business brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk, dairy products, meat and cattle. She has all of the necessary conditions to house cattle. In the summertime, her cattle are brought out to pasture. For the purpose of the further development of her business, Ainagul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy cows. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further expansion of her farm, specifically to buy thoroughbred sheep. She also plans to save money to build a house for her family in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1592960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Ryskul is a 48-year-old widow with 3 children.  She has the equivalent of a high school education with vocational training, and is a responsible, goal-oriented and good-natured woman.  Her family is closely-knit; her children get along well with each other and their mother, and are enthusiastic when helping with chores.  Ryskul sells goods from a shop for a living, first starting her business in 1997 with 2,500 som.  Thanks to her persistence, she's had her share of success with her shop; her monthly income is now nearly 12,000 som, and she's been able to provide for her children and fund their education.  To further develop her business, Ryskul is seeking a loan from Bai-Tushum & Partners to stock up on various kinds of soap and detergent to sell at her shop.  This will allow her to increase her income and set aside money for her daughter's wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1593002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy

He is eager to receive a Kiva loan so that he might expand his farm, and work on cleaning and underbrushing to increase his harvest. Liberato hopes to use the fruits of his labor to support his children's education.

It's been 5 years that she has been running this business. This new loan will serve to buy twelve bags of corn. Thus, she wishes to increase her loan, and educate, clothe and feed her children.
