Furthermore, her husband works for a local construction employer to have additional income. \r\n\r\nThis is Tien's fourth loan in Anh Chi Em Program and she will use this loan to buy piglets and food for pigs. She said that she was really grateful to Anh Chi Em Program for providing loans that supported her considerably in business and for training her with lots of knowledge about farming and breeding. She hasn't raised pigs before but she decided to try doing it this time because she was motivated when attending lessons about pigs held by Anh Chi Em team. \r\n\r\nTien hopes that she will succeed in her pig raising project with the loan and additional useful training lessons from Anh Chi Em.

She is an experienced and dynamic entrepreneur who is 50 years old and mother to nine children, five of whom are studying and four others who are already married. The customer sells beans and lays out her goods at home in the outlying district of the town. She began her business with capital from her husband, who is a teacher. Later on she got a loan from IMF Hekima. She has been carrying out this business for the past 30 years and this new loan will be used to buy two sacks of beans. She would thereby like to increase her capital, educate and feed her children. Finally, she is extremely grateful to Hekima for enabling female entrepreneurs who are excluded from the classic bank system to become autonomous, partiuclarly during this difficult post-conflict period in the east of the country. It should be noted that some of the customers in the photo are carrying their babies.

","en":"Rosa Stella is 19 years old and is from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.  She is in her 4th semester of nursing and she feels very happy to be studying this field because in her rotations she is learning a lot and has encountered wonderful people who have taught her.  Her family is made up of 3 siblings, her mother, and her nephew.  Rosa Stella is the youngest.  Her father died 12 years ago when she was only 7.  She suffered a lot due to the loss of her father, but she has managed to overcome with time.  Her mother was able to help the children get ahead through great sacrifice because she functioned as mother and father during a very difficult stage, during their maturation.  Today they are people who are aware of their lives with goals and projects in mind so that now they can be the ones to help their mother.  Rosa gives thanks to her mother for paying for her studies and for supporting her interests, because that is what children need in order to get ahead -- a family that gives good advice and inspiration to finish projects. Rosa wants to be a good nurse, to achieve success in her work and to distinguish herself for what she does and for her way of being.  One of her dreams is to visit many countries and different cultures and also to study English in order to go and work in the U.S. and have a good stable income.  Now that her mother no longer lives with her, she has realized that this is not an easy task.\r\n\r\nShe can say that she has the most wonderful family because they are very close and very concerned for each other.  She has the most beautiful mother because it is evident that she loves her children and cares for them and Rosa hopes that this continues for many years.\r\n\r\nWith this career Rosa will have a secure future and the satisfaction that the time she invested was not wasted but rather invested in personal development.  She will continue studying in this area of healthcare, which is what she likes, in order to help people in need of care. \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan from Kiva since it is her last semester of rotations and the expenses have increased and with Kiva's help the expenses will be a bit more manageable.

I enjoy this field because it allows me to develop as a negotiator, and be able to in the future create my own business that can become my way to earn a living when I become independent because it is always good to not only earn an income from your job, but to also have your own income to cover unforeseen expenses like the ones that my family has had to experience lately. \r\n\r\nWithout the help of this loan, I will not be able to continue my education as at the moment, I do not have the resources to cover the expenses. When I began my second quarter at the university, I found myself in need of taking out a loan to continue my education, believing that my family's financial situation would improve. However, now in my fifth quarter, I find myself in a situation where I will not be able to continue because the money that I need to pay back the first loan is a lot, and I would not be able to cover my transportation costs for which I have designated part of my income. \r\n\r\nI find myself again having to put my education on hold if I do not find the necessary resources to cover my final quarters. For this reason, it is important for me to be able to count on you so that I can continue my education, charge ahead, and reach the goals I have set for myself such as becoming a professional so that I can contribute to my society with my knowledge and help my family get ahead.

The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled her to obtain a loan of 1,500 GEL and start dairy farming.  Manana will purchase a milk cow, produce milk products, and sell them locally.  This will give her a chance to have a more stable income and manage financial difficulties more effectively.  Manana will be really grateful for your help, for giving her the chance at a better life.

In this way, he would assure himself of doing a good job in conserving the soil to avoid soil erosion.

All her children are already independent adults and help her out on the farm. She has received secondary education.  As a source of additional income for her family, Salia has been raising livestock and growing produce since 1994. Thanks to Salia's dedication, resilience and hard work, her farm now includes three dairy cows, two calves and one horse. She has all the necessary conditions for keeping livestock, and has fodder and hay stocked up. Salia sells dairy products. In addition, she grows farm produce: potatoes, corn and clover. Her monthly revenue is approximately 10,000 KGS.   In order to develop her farm further,  Salia has turned to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan to increase her livestock headcount by buying calves and sheep. Salia plans to use the revenues from her loan for an additional increase of livestock. She would also like to save up for building a house for her son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925.93,"image":{"id":1593829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy calves and sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jany-Jol village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-18T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-17T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":648.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925.93,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50406.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513543}],"funded_date":"2014-05-21T18:55:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":710517,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary is a Kiva borrower.

(one son and one daughter) in the small village of Tekatuli in Jalpaiguri district. She completed education up to grade 9, and her husband completed up to grade 8. Being less educated, she is very much enthusiastic to educate her children, and they are now in grades 5 and 2.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer, who sells vegetables in the local market. Anima helps her husband with agricultural activities. But, due to lack of variety in production, her husband is now unable to meet local people's demands, and because of this, his income is inconsistent. That is why Anima applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS).

Her husband and children actively help her tend to their farm.  She has the equivalent of a high school education and has been farming livestock for 16 years.  Gulmira's goal-oriented nature and love of hard work have enabled her to grow her farm to its current state; she has a dairy cow, 5 sheep and a horse, and makes around 10,000 som per month.  To further develop her farm, Gulmira is seeking a loan of 30,000 som from Bai-Tushum & Partners to buy more cows.  This will allow her to make more money each month from selling milk; money which will not only go towards buying even more dairy cows, but will help her afford some new home appliances as

All her children are grown up, financially independent and live on their own.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and is the sort of person who knows exactly what they want in life and stops at nothing to get it.  She raises livestock for a living and has been doing so since 1970, starting with an initial purchase of animals.  Thanks to her persistence, she currently has a dairy cow, a calf, a heifer and 10 sheep, and makes nearly 10,000 som per month.  She has everything she needs for raising livestock: she has a livestock shed and pastures nearby to graze her animals, and has ample stores of hay and other fodder on hand as well.  She keeps her dairy cows at her home year-round as they're self-sufficient and can look after themselves, while her sheep need to be driven out to pasture.  To further develop her farm, Anarkan is seeking a loan of 30,000 som from Bai-Tushum & Partners to buy more sheep.  She plans on using any profits due to the loan to continue to buy more livestock, as well as to set aside money for her youngest son's education.

All of her kids help out around the farm.  Gulzhan has a high school education and her main source of income comes from farming and raising livestock.  She began her business in 2011 with 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her dedication, persistence and diligence, Gulzhan currently has one calf, 18 goats and 8 sheep.  Gulzhan also has 2 hectares of land where she wants to grow clover.  Gulzhan makes 12,000 som (KGS) per month in selling milk products.\r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Gulzhan turned to the bank of Bai Tushum for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional goats and cows.  This will expand her herd and increase her income from selling milk products.  In addition, Gulzhan wants to use part of the loan for the purchasing of clover seeds.  Part of the profits, Gulzhan is planning to reinvest into increasing the headcount of her livestock and to save the rest for the building of a barn to house her

Both studied up to grade eight and could not continue further due to the poor financial resources of their family. Their son reads in grade one and their daughter is too young to go to school.\r\n\r\nChumki's husband is involved in agricultural activities.  In particular, he has a plot of agricultural land where he grows potatoes, beans and eggplant.  He is a very hardworking man who does his best to have a good harvest. He sells his agricultural products to the local markets. He is a very polite and well-behaved person. \r\n\r\nNow Chumki decided to start a milk supply business to give financial support to her husband. That's why she has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase a cow.  Her main customers are her neighbors.

district of Jalpaiguri. She and her husband Nirmal are uneducated and can sign only their names. They have no children.  They live in their own kachha house (a house made of straw, mud and bamboo).\r\n\r\nDhritibala's husband supports his family economically with his work in agriculture. He has a lot of experience in agriculture, which he learned from his parents.  Dhritibala works hard to help her husband by sowing, plowing and harvesting.  They grow different vegetables in different seasons.  They carry the produce to the local market.  Their income from the business is very inconsistent.
