They say they still need a loan until they have enough savings to continue the business by themselves. The loan use is for increasing the population of pigs, purchasing feed, and also renovating the pen. Ni Komang will use her portion of the loan to purchase superior piglets only. She will buy feed with her own money to combine with the traditional feed she can get from her garden. She hopes this time the pigs will grow healthy, free from diseases and get fat. For that, she will always have contact with the vet and give the pigs nutritious feed and vitamins.

Homa Bay county is located at the south-western tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people, and a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay county often boasts traders from Ugandan, Tanzania and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay county means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average.\r\n\r\nPhilip is married and has six children.  He is a photographer and he undertakes farming with his wife as well. They have been farming for ten years now and they are currently growing maize, beans, sunflower, bananas and oranges. Philip is excited about beekeeping as it will earn him some additional income as well as provide him with honey for food and medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is Philip\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to invest in his business.

cuales no vende por no tener suficiente mercader\u00eda.\n\n\nLos sue\u00f1os de Rosa son tener una mejor vivienda de la que ahora tiene, por darle lo necesario a sus hijos para que no sufran lo mismo que ella, tener una tienda mas grande  y as\u00ed obtener mayores ganancias, sabe que es un reto pero con la ayuda de Dios lo podr\u00e1 hacer posible.","en":"Rosa is 45 years old. due to lack of financial resources she only studied up to Grade 1. She was one of the older children and had to help her parents support the household. She is divorced. Her husband left for the USA and abandoned her. She lives with a daughter and a grandchild as her older son is married.<br \/><br \/>Rosa has a store which sells basic food items in her house. She has had this for 10 years. She also sells tortillas. She has two stands one her daughter cares for and she takes care of the other. She has no set work schedule as she gets up very early and finishes in the evening when the customers have done their buying. <br \/><br \/>The money from the loan will be invested in buying corn to make tortillas. If she buys a lot the price is lower. She will also invest in her store as at times she has no sales due to a lack of product in her store.<br \/><br \/>Rosa's dreams are to have a better house that what she now has. She wants to provide for her children and not have them suffer like she did. She wants to expand her store and make more money. she knows that it is a challenge but with the help of God she knows it is possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1586792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They live in their own house, which was given by the government. \r\n\r\nUjavala (the lady with her hand raised in the picture) has 20 years experience in animal husbandry, in particular goat rearing. She purchases a 1 or 2-month-old goat kid, and she rears it following all the requirements (veterinarian support, food, etc.) When the goat becomes 1 or 1\u00bd years old, she sells it at a fair or weekly market. If she can sell it during festivals, she will make a better profit. For extra cash, Ujavala also works in agriculture fields for daily wages.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying one more goat kid and raising it. This enables her to generate income so that she can support her family in securing a better life. She hopes to save enough for her son\u2019s education and make him well settled. She wants to see empowerment in her community in education, as well as economically. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan from Kiva for \u201cBhagya Laxmi Mahila SwaSahaya Sangh\u201d Self-Help Group (SHG).

She started this business with 5000 som (KGS). Thanks to Sulpukan's hard work, she has been able to develop her farm to include 1 milk cow, 1 calf, 3 horses and 15 sheep. This business brings in a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk, meat and cattle. She has all of the necessary conditions to house cattle as well as feed and hay prepared. Sulpukan also has a 2.40 hectare plot of land on which she grows wheat, barley and potatoes for personal consumption and sale. For the purpose of the further development of her business, Sulpukan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She requested a loan for 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow.

children. Duyshekan has a higher education in the field of foreign languages. Her husband and her children help her with her farm. Her family is very close-knit and they have good relationships with one another. As an additional source of income for her family, Duyshekan practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business in 2003 with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Duyshekan's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows, 1 bull calf and 20 sheep on her farm. This business brings in about 20,000 som (KGS) per month. The earnings from the farm allow Duyshekan to raise and provide for her children. For the purpose of the further development of her farm, she turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 120,000 som (KGS) to buy cows. A portion of the loan will be spent on purchasing sheep. Duyshekan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further expansion of her farm. She also wants to make renovations to her home in the

children. All of her children are grown-up and self-sufficient. They actively help her with her farm. Basarbu has a secondary education. As an additional source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business in 1992 with 8,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Basarbu's hard work, she currently has 5 milk cows, 4 calves, 25 sheep, 5 horses and 5 colts on her farm. She also has a 1.60 hectare plot of irrigated land on which she grows potatoes, clover, wheat and corn. Her agricultural business brings in about 10,000 som (KGS) a month. The earnings from her farm allowed Basarbu to raise and educate her children.

She has had to provide them with a good future by sacrificing many things like not being able to go to school and working over eight hours a day to bring home good sustenance.  This is all because the children\u2019s father has not been responsible for their care and love.  To him the first things are his friends and drinking.\r\n\r\nSix months ago she had to give up her work because she had a nervous breakdown.  It was so severe that she lost control and fell into a depression.  The children were very surprised and sad about what was happening.  This is because they always had the mental image of their mother as a tenacious and tireless woman.\r\n\r\nShe had to go through some very difficult times in order to be able to realize that she was a person who had a big future and that she needed to get ahead.

This is a productive area, very well known for growing yucca and plantains.\r\n\r\nVinicio works as an electrician, but because his income does not help him enough to support his family, he decided to begin selling fish and shellfish.  Now he has been selling fish and shrimp for three years in nearby settlements.  Vinicio goes through the towns in his father's car.  He works all day at this business every Wednesday and Thursday.  He needs money for purchase of a motorbike in order to sell his products using his own vehicle.  This is why he came to ask for a loan since neighbors in his settlement have benefited from loans.  Vinicio is happy and very grateful that Fundacion Alternativa and KIVA  could help him. With this money he will buy his motorbike and also shrimp to sell advantageously.  Then with these profits he wants to buy more shrimp in order to begin marketing them in the mountains.

With the resources obtained, Javier is even thinking of starting another agricultural business raising cattle, chicken or pigs.  However for that he needs this business, which is the basis of his income, to succeed.   He hopes to continue with the business many years more till he leaves a  solid legacy for his descendants."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1835.4,"image":{"id":1601024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

It's a dynamic city where most of its residents are in agriculture or raising animals, as it's an area with a lot of vegetation. This is where Eufemia, 37 years old, lives. She's married, and she and her husband have three children, ages 13, 10 and 9. Her children are all in school, and her husband is a farmer. Five years ago Eufemia opened a small retail shop in her home with the help of a loan. There she sells clothing, shoes, jewelry, phone cards, perfumes, and all sorts of gifts.

Starting out by doing wedding ceremonies as a military chaplain, he eventually moved into performing a wide variety of civil, religious and interfaith wedding ceremonies. \r\n\r\nOne of the things Bill enjoys most about his job is meeting young couples whose excitement for marriage is contagious to everyone around them and helping them plan beautiful and meaningful wedding ceremonies. He is committed to personalizing his ceremonies to a couple\u2019s unique personalities and takes the time to meet them face-to-face so that he can learn more about them and creatively come up with their dream wedding. \r\n\r\nAfter performing hundreds of wedding through the years, Bill has finally formalized his officiating services in a company in February of this year. In the past three months alone, Bill has already performed 17 weddings and already has 13 requests for 2015.  \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan of $2,000 will help Bill get his business on weddingwire.com, a nationally known wedding website that will connect Bill to new clients and spread information about his services to a larger audience. \r\n\r\nLooking forward, Bill would like to grow to a point where he can open a local office so that he has a space to meet his clients. \r\n\r\nCheck out Bill\u2019s website at: http:\/\/weddingofficiantceremonies.com\/

market as well as the colorful traditional outfits that the women of the town wear. It has a long and rich cultural history. In a rural area outside of the town, the new Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cBendici\u00f3n de Dios\u201d or \u201cBlessing of God\u201d has recently been formed. It is composed of eight enthusiastic women who are anxious to empower themselves and eliminate poverty.\r\n\r\nEach Friendship Bridge Trust Bank has a Board of Directors that includes a President, Secretary and Treasurer. In the \u201cBendici\u00f3n de Dios\u201d Trust Bank, Micaela is the Secretary which is very exciting to her as she wants to develop her leadership skills. Micaela is 20 years old and married when she was 15. She has 3 sons. Because of the economic situation of her family, she was not able to attend school past the 6th grade. Micaela ponders the future of her sons and wants them to have a different life and reap the benefits of a good education. She works hard in her textile business and creates typical handmade blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d, tablecloths and woven belts. Her textiles are beautiful and carefully made. Micaela is requesting her first loan from Friendship Bridge which she will use to purchase a variety of threads and other materials for her work.\r\n\r\nMicaela is also excited to participate in the non-formal educational trainings that a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer offers each month for the Trust Bank. She wants to learn more about business administration, customer service, and budgeting, women\u2019s health and hygiene as well as children\u2019s rights and education. Other topics include self-esteem and nutrition. It is the combination of the loans and the educational component that comprises the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nEach of the 8 ladies in the \u201cBendici\u00f3n de Dios\u201d Trust Bank appreciate the assistance and generosity of Kiva investors. They are committed to paying back their loans fully and on time. The women look forward to sustaining and expanding their small businesses. We look forward to reporting on their progress in the future!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1605879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To

This place is known for being very dynamic and the majority of its inhabitants work in agriculture and raising animals because it is a place with a lot of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThis is where Mar\u00eda lives. She is 31 years old, is in a common law marriage, and has four children, aged 13, 11, 9 and 3. The oldest is in high school and two are in primary school. Her husband is a master bricklayer. Mar\u00eda is a housewife, who in order to make her own income and help her husband with the household expenses sells clothing of all types and Yanbal (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume and women's accessories). She sells door to door and works every day morning or evening because it's easier for her to make her rounds at those times. She sells on credit and collects every week. She has been doing this activity for 6 years and with it she helps her children with their education expenses.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy children's under wear so she can take advantage of the season when these articles sell very well. She has been in the credit group for 6 years and she likes it because she started her business with the first loan. Her dream is to have a boutique. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1601057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy children's underwear.

The women average 35 years of age and four children each, all living in Kanadjiguila, in Commune du Mand\u00e9, Cercle de Kati. And they know one another through ties of kinship, community, and friendship. The group members have small-scale businesses involving secondhand clothing of the best qualities, milk, and cosmetic products. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing their business capital, the group members decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMs. Sitan (second from the right in the photo) is known for selling used clothing of the best qualities. She intends to use her loan to purchase 2 bales of used clothing in Bamako. At the market and by hawking, her sales are made at the retail level to a customer base composed mostly of women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Sitan hopes to make an average monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA that will be used for reinvesting in her business and meeting the various needs of the children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1605017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kanadjiguila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-05-20T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-19T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam             Sy    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nagnouma         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lala            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8ba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":133470.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961211},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":133470.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677599},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":133470.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677284},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":133470.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530210039},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":133470.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658766},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":133470.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561792957}],"funded_date":"2014-05-20T17:11:28Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":711364,"name":"Narcisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of three children, Narcisa works hard to support her family.

Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,500,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Adama requires a loan in order to pay for additional stock. She hopes that this loan will help support her to get more customers and help increase her profit margin. In the future, Adama plans to open another shop and to be a supplier. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1605815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for glass plates, glass cups, and small serving bowls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Freetown Central","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2014-05-20T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-19T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":851116.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504177534},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":851116.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517462173},{"amount":168.4,"local_amount":716600,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T09:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":731891.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542439495},{"amount":614.93,"local_amount":2616733.34,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T09:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2672573.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579487756}],"funded_date":"2014-06-18T00:10:59Z","paid_date":"2015-03-10T09:55:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":711377,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1054.75,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for flasks, dishes, pots, and Coleman stoves.

Runa helps her husband in his agricultural work like planting, sowing, and harvesting, while managing her household.  In order to grow more they want to cultivate a profitable crop.  They have chosen bitter gourd for cultivation in their farmland. Bitter gourd is a vegetable which is in great demand, as it is used widely in a tropical country like India.\r\n\r\nSo Runa has taken a loan from BJS to purchase seeds, fertilizers and other necessary agricultural inputs to start the cultivation as early as possible.

There is no doubt that seeing her mother work on the sewing machine awakened her curiosity.
