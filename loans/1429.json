He has a high determination inside himself. Sameer didn't receive enough financial support from his family through his studies in the institute as a student because the family was faced with bad conditions in that period.\r\n\r\nRecently, he has worked as an electrician in an electricity company. Over time, he could accumulate a good amount of money. Unfortunately, the money that he accumulated from his job is not enough to purchase a taxi. Sameer requested a loan of 500,000 YER (Yemen rials) from AMB in order to purchase a taxi for transportation. He says this business is good for him. Through this business, Sameer can save a lot of money that will help him provide his family with a lot of money. \r\n\r\nSameer looks forward to purchasing a piece of land and building a house on it.

In the future, Anju plans to raise the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. In the Kathmandu Valley, clothing is made to order. Tailor stalls line the streets where store owners sell material and work their sewing machines. These skilled tailors make school uniforms for children as well as the the traditional women's kurta surwal and men's daura surwal. With a Kiva loan, BPW borrowers are able to purchase additional cloth material or sewing machines that will increase production and profitability.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

Now, the family lives in a rented house and that costs him a lot of money. As a result, Mona is requesting a loan of 40,000 YER from AMB. She will use the loan to purchase construction materials such as cement and bricks in order to build their own house. Mona's dream in the future is building more than one floor and renovating them.

The family lives in a small house. This small house consists of two rooms, plus one bathroom, and one kitchen. This thing makes the family feel ashamed, particularly if any guest or visitor comes to visit them in their house. For this reason, Ebtisam applied for a loan of 60,000 YER from AMB. The family will use the loan to purchase construction materials, in order to build two more rooms and another bathroom, which will make the house spacious.<br \/><br \/>Ebtisam hopes to open a savings account in AMB.

Her oldest child is 28-years-old and the youngest one is 5-years-old. She is an uneducated woman, but she works hard inside her house. She works as a housewife.  Sa'ada says that her house lacks many home appliances and she can't afford them.  Inside the kitchen of her house, Sa'ada makes many kinds of drinks and sweets, but she doesn't have a refrigerator to keep all the drinks and foods in a cold condition. As a result, most of the food and drinks expire quickly. So, she puts them in the litter bin. For this reason, Sa'ada is requesting a loan of 50,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase a refrigerator to keep foods and drinks in a cold condition in the house. \r\n\r\n Sa'ada looks forward to building the second floor and renovating it.

It is comprised of four women. They all live in traditional and simple families, in Sana'a, Yemen. They know one another through friendship and neighborhood connections. They applied for a loan of 190,000 YER from AMB. <br \/><br \/>Asrya is a 36-year-old, married woman, and she has six children. She is the leader of the group. Asrya lives with her family in their own house. She is an uneducated woman, and she works as a housewife. She is very dynamic and vigorous. Her husband is the sole breadwinner of the family. Their house is very small. The family couldn't afford to change this condition, and they feel ashamed, particularly if any visitor or guest comes to the house in order to visit them. Sana'a has a cold climate in most of the year's days. The house has a small bathroom.

called Duajhar in the Nuapada district of Odisha, India formed a Joint Liability Group named Santoshi \u2019A\u2019 with the objective of expanding their existing businesses by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \n\nPadmabati, a lady of 47 years standing second from left with her hand raised, is one of the members. She is very active and always cheerful. Her present family members consist of her husband and one son, 25 years old.\n\nFor the last 30 years, Padmabati has been running a clothing vending business with the help and support of her husband. This is their traditional business. Her husband purchases ready-made garments and saris from a wholesale market 200 kilometers away. He moves to different weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her existing business. But her present income is not sufficient to manage the business expenses as well as the household expenses for her family. So Padmabati wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. This is her fourth loan from Mahashakti Foundation.

She is part of a family tradition of coffee farming which has been the family's strongest form of income for generations. It covers the different needs in their home. She learned the work, such as picking coffee, in her community as her only source of employment and income. Apart from working in this activity, she is also a merchant who sells vegetables in her community. She sells chayote, onions, beets, and other crops that she grows herself. \r\nHer property is the result of her effort and work because she did not inherit it. She has been with her husband for years. From her marriage, she has three children but only two live with her because the oldest son is already married and in his own home although he does contribute in different capacities in the field to help crops maintain their excellent condition. \r\nHer goals for this new year are to increase her coffee harvest by 100%. They want to have an excellent crop by slowly growing and generating more income every year. Last season, the harvest was affected by a blight destroying two fields [of approximately 3.5 acres] in which they were growing the Caturra variety of coffee. Thanks to this financial support that she is requesting, she can prevent this from happening again. Her dreams as a mother are to support her children's goals, projects, and helping them becoming good people and hard workers. she has asked for the loan from COMIXMUL with which she will buy agricultural inputs to maintain her coffee crops so that at the end of the season she will obtain excellent results. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1601541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and pay day laborers to maintain her coffee harvest ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-05-20T21:20:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-19T21:20:24Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cornelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8117.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762690}],"funded_date":"2014-05-21T00:36:07Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Megan Hinrichsen","image":1975748}},{"id":711044,"name":"Amahoriwacu Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"S.

hasta el 7\u00b0 grado, motivo por el cual ya no continuo sus estudios fue porque su padre una persona ya de la tercera edad comenz\u00f3 a ponerse mal de salud hasta el punto que falleci\u00f3 y fue \u00e9l quien desde ese momento tomo las riendas de su hogar en el cual le tocaba trabajar muy fuerte para llevar el sustento diario a su familia que est\u00e1 compuesta por su madre y sus 3

He earns his living in farming.  He learned the trade from his father, who showed him the path to being a good person in life.  He is 24 years old. \r\n\r\nHe used to live with his father, whom he helped with his work every day in the mornings, since in the afternoons he attended school, where he completed the seventh grade.  At that point his father was already elderly, and his health began to decline.  When his father died, Josu\u00e9 took the reins of his household, and he worked very hard to bring daily sustenance to his family, which is made up of his mother and his three sisters.\r\n\r\nSince then, the young man has worked in agriculture, managing egg-laying hens as well as butchering pigs.  His mother and sisters also are involved in this work, and his sisters are currently studying at the school in the community.\r\n\r\nJosu\u00e9 has 15 years of farming experience, since it is an activity which he learned from his father, who worked the land with a great deal of pride.  He has two years of experience managing egg-laying hens, since he took a basic course in the care and management of birds.  On top of this, every weekend he butchers pigs.  He started this six months ago, and it has become his main source of income.\r\n\r\nHe will use the funds to improve his operations.  The birds that he currently has have reached an age where it is not practical to continue with them.  Thus he needs to purchase new birds that will continue to produce eggs.   He will invest part of the money in improving his area for butchering pigs. In this way he will improve his income and therefore his family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn the future he plans to have a vehicle, so that he can travel and move his business.  He has plans to build a new shelter for raising pigs, which will require him to travel to the village to purchase feed for his pigs and birds.  He also plans to rebuild his home, since the one in which he currently lives with his family is built of mud.  With good investment of his profits and good management of a new loan, he will be able to build a new home and provide all the conditions needed for a better life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1601572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase new birds to produce eggs.

Luis Fernando is 15 years old. He is now studying at the Santo Toribio de Mongrovejo school. He is in the 10th grade. As a requirement for graduation, the school has asked Fernando to be in or to have studied a technical course. Because of this, Fernando decided to look for a technical class related to health, since he has a life plan to study for a professional medical career, and he is interested in being a medical assistant. He looked for options such as those at SENA, but because the extensive hours interfered with Fernando's school, some days later in the classroom he received the information that in the Campo Alto institution, they had a portfolio of technical programs that included Nursing Assistant, it had a good reputation as an educational institution, and it has the facility to have semesters financed. Without any hesitation, he enrolled. Now he is about to finish his first semester, satisfied with the education that Campo Alto offers him.\r\n\r\nLuis Fernando aims to obtain all the knowledge that the technical program for Nursing Assistant can offer him, with the goal of helping other people when their level of health or life is in danger, to exercise the knowledge he has learned in order to give good help at the moment of doing his work.\r\n\r\nFernando also wants to finish his high school degree satisfactorily in the school that he now attends. He has a goal of studying at a university, studying for a professional career in medicine, because he is passionate about it and would like to save lives, help everyone, cure them, and give them a healthy life without complications. \r\n\r\nThe agreement with Kiva will be a great help, since as he is studying in secondary school, the expenses that he has in school in addition to what he has at Campo Alto are a little difficult to pay. He would be completely satisfied if Kiva would be able to help him, and the payment of the bills would be a little more economical for him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1599939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester of school fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-05-21T00:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-20T00:20:15Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":290000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-11T09:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":167874.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":491286522},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":167874.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504225230}],"funded_date":"2014-05-21T00:53:01Z","paid_date":"2014-07-24T09:03:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":711008,"name":"Passionate Ladies Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience, 26, is the chairperson of the Passionate Ladies group, which consists of ambitious and hardworking ladies.

Ferdinand and his wife own and operate a local equipped palm oil processing mill and majority of his mill users are widows. Annually Ferdinand and his mill users process palm oil for the local market. One of the major challenges he is facing now is storage facility. The old storage container he has been using is fast rusting away and sometimes contaminates his final products.  \n\nFerdinand is requesting this loan from Nke-Anyi Farmers Multipurpose Cooperative Society which he is also a member of to enable him purchase plastic storage containers.\n\nFerdinand is a very mild person and loves to encourage and help the needy within his village, which makes him well-spoken off by relatives and other members of his village.\nFerdinand currently supports his grand sons in Secondary school and hopes that soon he will be able to modernize his mill through Nke-Anyi FMCS mills equipment loan.\n\nThe group thanks all those who lovingly contributes to their loan.

They are requesting a loan of 250,000 YER from AMB.\nAsma is the leader of the group. She is a 31-year-old married woman, and she has two children. Her oldest child is 11 years old, and the youngest one is 7 years old. Asma studied until the elementary school, but she couldn't complete her studies.  Asma's husband is an employee, as a soldier in the army. The salary which he receives from this work is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family.  Asma says that her house lacks a refrigerator, and she can't afford this.  Inside the kitchen of her house, Asma keeps many kinds of drinks and sweets that they need to be in a cold condition. Particularly, when the climate becomes very hot in the summer season. Unfortunately, she doesn't have a refrigerator in order to keep all the drinks in that condition.

He is a farmer who went to school until 9th grade.  He is married, and his wife takes care of the household chores.  They have had four children, three of whom go to school.  \r\n\r\nDon Claros has made his living in agriculture for the last 15 years.  He learned the trade from an older brother.  Don Claros makes his living solely from farming, and farming has allowed him to be a married man today.  The farming has served him well, as it has allowed him to support his household.  Don Claros works about 10 minutes from his home, and gets there on foot.  He works from 5:30am to 11:00am.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, Don Claros will purchase agricultural supplies.  He will buy six sacks of compost and herbicide, to kill the weeds that are affecting his crop, and pay the rent on the land he will be planting.  All of this will improve his situation a lot because with the help of the loan he will be able to plant more and then earn a greater income when the harvest comes in. \r\n\r\nDon Claros's dreams are to be able to keep planting and to help his children in their schooling.  He wants his children to excel academically, which is a legacy he will leave to them and will serve them greatly.  Don Claros will achieve his dreams with a lot of effort and hard work.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1596757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase 6 sacks of compost and herbicides, to kill the weeds that are affecting his crop, and to pay the rent on the land he will be planting.

He is 40 years old, and is married with 3 young children. He has seven years of experience as a teacher.

From Monday to Thursday, he works providing transportation services using his father's vehicle. He also works in a photo studio in his town. He grew up with his parents, who brought him up and supported him in his studies, until he graduated high school with a technical qualification in journalism. He then started working for a company as a sales representative. Over time he learned photography from a friend, who recommended Kevin for his position when he had to travel abroad. In this post, Kevin began to be successful as a photographer, and this is the work that is now most important to him. He also learned to ride a motorcycle, which gives him the advantage of being able to move around more quickly, and cover events where his services are sought for.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to consolidate his debts with a friend, who lent him money to buy a professional camera to take photos and videos. Using this, he is starting to set up his own business, offering photographic and video services. With his own business he will be able to free himself from debts and improve his income, and it will be much easier for him to make his loan repayments. \r\n\r\nKevin's goals for the future are to repay his loan, and then to seek a further loan to set up a photo studio in his local community, as well as a stationer's shop. He hopes to continue his studies, and his dream is to be a civil engineer specialising in construction, and support his siblings in their education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1601580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to consolidate his debts with a friend who lent him money to buy a professional camera to take photos and videos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-21T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-20T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kevin Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":26.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":27.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.21},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":32.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":37.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.03,"local_amount":27.03,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T11:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":27.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490818265},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":27.28,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":27.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243491},{"amount":28.59,"local_amount":28.59,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":28.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526626},{"amount":517.1,"local_amount":517.1,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":517.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501084}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T02:34:06Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:35:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Phipps","image":null}},{"id":711749,"name":"Lusila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lusila is 27 years old and married with five children. \r\n\r\nShe has a small garden where she grows cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplant and cabbages that she can sell in her community or at the market.

She does domestic work and works in commerce, since she is the proprietor of a mini store in the community, and she also takes care of her family. She grew up with her parents, who worked in commerce on Saturdays in the town plaza and worked in agriculture the other days of the week, as well as in masonry. She has a basic education through 4th grade in the national school, and she wasn't able to continue her studies because her family is of scarce resources and she is one of the older sisters, and so she left school and worked in the family business. With the passing of time, she decided to set up her own business, which began with the sale of basic products, and she now sells natural medicinal products. She is married and is the mother of three children, who go to the school in their community.\r\n\r\nThe loan granted will be used to invest in the expansion and improvement of her house, since she has begun to construct sanitary services and a wash area with a water trough, and she needs to finish them so that her house has basic sanitation services. Another part of the loan will be invested in agriculture, in planting basic grains, and in stocking her business; in this way she will keep her business stocked with products and will give better service to her customers, for which her economic earnings will improve.\r\n\r\nThe plans that she has for the future are to strengthen her business and have a larger shop, which will allow her to set up sales of pupusas (a typical Salvadoran dish) on weekdays in the afternoons and to support the schooling of her children until they are successful professionals. With the benefit that the loan offers her, she will use the proceeds to invest in and improve her house and expand and stock her business, and she will make a new loan application to set up a nixtamal (corn flour) mill in her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1601604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to expand and improve her house, since she has begun to construct sanitary services and a wash area with a water trough; she will also invest in planting basic grains and stocking her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-21T04:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-20T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Candida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":72.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":89.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":95.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":104.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.67,"local_amount":68.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":68.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243493},{"amount":73.71,"local_amount":73.71,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":73.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526627},{"amount":71.78,"local_amount":71.78,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":71.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009034},{"amount":75.38,"local_amount":75.38,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":75.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501086},{"amount":78.95,"local_amount":78.95,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":78.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419890},{"amount":80.28,"local_amount":80.28,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544674},{"amount":85.2,"local_amount":85.2,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":85.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145055},{"amount":466.03,"local_amount":466.03,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":466.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768694}],"funded_date":"2014-05-29T22:27:05Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:21:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":708201,"name":"Las \u00d1ustas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cLAS \u00d1USTAS\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.
