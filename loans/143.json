In the village she and her children lived a miserable life, so she came to Lom\u00e9 to engage in business. Having been cast in the role of breadwinner for her family, she began selling cosmetics, candy, and simple groceries, which has been quite successful. Since she is concerned, however, about educating her children, she is asking for a loan of  US$ 500 which will allow her to expand her inventory and thus keep her customers satisfied and coming back to her. In that way, she will be able to earn more from her business and do better by her children.<P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Ag\u00e9e de 50 ans, Madame T.

Jasray, his wife, works at the shoe factory, and the children go to school. He moved to Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, from the countryside a decade ago. During the last 10 years, he has been making traditional belts called Gyargan. The beautiful belts are made from woven silk. Before 1930, this type of belt was used commonly by the lamas, or Tibetan Buddhist priests (50% of Mongolians practice Tibetan Buddhism, or Lamaism, according to the CIA World Factbook). \r\n\r\nNowadays, very few people know how to make Gyargan belts. He learned to make the Gyargan belt from his aunt. At first, it was hard for him to find clients. But now he has many customers who buy the Gyargan belt to use during the lunar New Year celebration. Uuganbayar weaves only one belt in 3 days, or about 10-12 per month. His monthly income from his business is MNT 160,000-180,000 (1500 MNT=$1 USD).

She is 27 years old and lives with her partner and their daughter, Carol, who is 4, in her mother-in-law's house which she lives in happily.\r\n<p> For 6 years she has been selling sweets.  At the start she ran her business from a kiosk by the side of her house made, a little precariously, of rush mats.  She got up very early to help her mother in the kitchen so that she could serve in the kiosk afterwards as she did not want to leave it unattended as she feared it may be broken into by thieves.  Her kiosk now has some windows to display her products.\r\n<p>\r\nCatherine likes her business because it allows her to talk to and get to know many people - both clients and neighbours - and thanks to good sales she is now able to help out with her household's expenses and with the finances to help finish their house's construction.  She is very grateful to her parents and will stay on with her partner and watch over her parents' future.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future she plans to study dressmaking and set up her own workshop at home, as well as keeping on selling sweets.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her eighth credit with MFP and she affirms that she will carry on being punctual with the repayments, as she is very grateful to the members of this bank who have given her the opportunity to get loans.  The money that she is asking for at the moment is to buy biscuits, soft drinks and some other merchandise for her business.\r\n<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":472777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise\/Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-19T18:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124473},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960214},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":427.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993058},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717844},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751520},{"amount":149.4,"local_amount":415,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":425.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933988}],"funded_date":"2010-01-19T21:03:55Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Harvey","image":null}},{"id":173678,"name":"Querer Es Poder Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl Banco D.

They have three children who are between 19 and 26 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nVeronica joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, further uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan she is requesting PHP 250000 to buy feed and stock for her business so that she can continue to save up for family and business improvements. Veronica Z. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Florencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. Florencia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Florencia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

To make a living, Amihan owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration & tailoring services to local community members. Amihan has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Amihan joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amihan is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Amihan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

The group is located in the city of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.  It has ten members who have known each other for the last three years; they are neighbors and family members. \r\n\r\nThe group representative is Evodia.  She\u2019s 40 years old and went up to 5th grade.  She has five children: three girls and two boys.  She sells tamales and needs the loan to buy the food she needs to make tamales.  Her customers would like a larger space to sit down to eat with their families because the place where she sells her tamales is very small.  Evodia also wants to enlarge her locale to have more customers so that she won\u2019t have to go out to sell any longer and neglect her locale.  Evodia wants this loan to enlarge her locale and to earn more profits to start another business; she\u2019d like it to be clothes sales.\r\n\r\nGudelia Agustina is another member of the Esquipulas group.  She is 68 years old and has nine children: five girls and four boys, all adults.  She sells fish and needs the loan to buy more fish because she sells both at home and at the market.

She is therefore requesting a loan of $900 to build a kiosk and stock it with all kinds of generic pharmaceuticals. This will cause growth in her clientele and thus her income. As a result of this loan and the development of her business, Mrs. A.\u2019s socioeconomic standard of living will improve considerably.\r\n<p><b> Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\nAg\u00e9e de 35 ans, Madame A.

She\u2019s been immersed in raising animals since her childhood and, for that reason, she decided to remain in this industry. \r\n\r\nShe works very hard to obtain the income that will satisfy her family\u2019s necessities.  The immense love that she feels from her children and her faithful husband motivates her to keep working hard.  She wishes to buy more animals and, in this way, increase her income.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mariama does not have a shop, therefore she carries the cloth around on her head to sell to her customers; rainy can be very difficult for her business.<P>\r\n\r\nMariama has been running this business for 14 years and is grateful for whatever this business has done for her. Mariama has hopes of importing textiles from abroad and owning a store in order to make business easier for her, instead of carrying goods on her head. She sells good textiles at a reasonable price to encourage her customers to keep buying from her. <P>\r\n\r\nMariama needs this loan in order to purchase a variety of textiles that can serve her customers. She also dreams of making a better life for herself and her family.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 44 years old. Elsie is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Elsie owns & operates a business venture making & selling food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ground pork and beef products known as \"longganisa\". Elsie has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP average a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Elsie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to expand her sales of ground pork and beef products. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Elsie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Concordia municipality in Jinotega.  He is 41 years old and married with two kids.  He has a basic education, having only reached sixth grade.  Since then, he's worked in agriculture.  He began working in agriculture with his parents when he was very young, mainly cleaning and watering.  His father helped Lester with his personal finances so he could study.\r\n\r\nWhen Lester was 15 years old, his father died, leaving Lester in charge of his family since he was the eldest brother.  Lester dedicated himself to producing the five parcels of land his father left to the family.  In the beginning, Lester contracted a partner to help him sow the land, since he no longer had sufficient resources to do it by himself.  Taking care of the land stopped Lester from continuing school because now he had other priorities.  Lester also worked buying and selling beans and land.\r\n\r\nRight now, Lester is helping his children study so that they can improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nHe asked for this loan to grow vegetables, which he hopes will obtain good revenues.  His goals also include buying land to increase his crops, becoming completely independent from his brothers, and having his children become professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":700766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Growing vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-01-27T03:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lester Isidro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":821.04,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":821.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":821.04,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201324905}],"funded_date":"2011-01-27T07:15:34Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lydia Brantley","image":null}},{"id":272526,"name":"Sophy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sophy C.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 30-year-old Zelea G. from Mbarali. She is single but has 3 children, between the ages of 3 and 13.  Zelea has been running a local restaurant, \u201cMama Lishe\u201d since 2002. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13-16 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by her mother. She currently earns about 200USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase more rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Zelea  thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zelea M.

For the last 8 years she has sold \"juanes\" (a typical regional chicken and rice dish) and beverages from the doorway of her house, which is across the street from a school, which means that the students are her main customers.  What she likes about her business is that it keeps her busy and she feels useful, and she enjoys talking with her customers.  Also, the business is very profitable, because the food that she serves is very popular and she sells a lot of beverages due to the intense heat in the area.

Together, they have been selling wood furniture for many years.\r\n\r\nTeresita has been a regular member of Kiva's partner Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow 13 times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy more wood and lumber.   Her business lets her earn a profit of 8,500 Philippine pesos per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like a PHP 22,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for buying more wood and lumber for her expanding furniture business.\r\n\r\nShe prays that they will have earn enough resources to fix their house and that their children will have a better life in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":472809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

Its members are businesswomen.  Alicia and Veronica sell fresh cut up chicken.  Teresa, Leovigilda, and Angela sell tamales.  Margarita and Porfiria sell cosmetics from a catalog.  Andrea sells vegetables.  Dolores sells bread and Carolina sells fresh and dried fish and shrimp that she gets from Pinotepa or Corralero, where they fish for seafood.\r\n\r\nTeresa is the group\u2019s representative.  She is married and has two children, ages 14 and 5.  She sells tamales because she\u2019s been working for many years in this trade and this is an item that sells quickly and in good quantity.  She works so that she can help her husband with the household expenses and she hopes that her children will succeed and one day take professional careers.  She will use the money from this loan to buy ingredients, such as dried chili, lard, salt, oregano, banana leaves, corn, and firewood.  She will also use some of the money to pay for trips to Pinotepa, where she buys her ingredients.\r\n\r\nShe knows all of her fellow members very well and tells us that they are very responsible people who will not be delinquent with their payments.  She also says that in the future she would like to open an establishment where she can offer a variety of food, such as sopes, enchiladas, tamales, tostadas, etc.  She is thankful for the support that the Kiva lenders have given her through \u201cFundacion Realidad,\u201d and asks that they continue to offer loans so that the ladies can improve their lives.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":495766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Ingredients and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SANTIAGO PINOTEPA NACIONAL","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-03-05T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leovigilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Porfiria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1737.5,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":22100.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952440},{"amount":651.56,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":8287.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136681266},{"amount":1085.94,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13812.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715791}],"funded_date":"2010-03-06T13:33:56Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

He owns his home and shares it with his wife and their two young children. They live in the district of Tambogrande, specifically in the village of Guaraguaos Bajo. It is a rural region and fairly tropical. The majority of the population work on small fruit plantations and raise animals.\r\n\r\nRoberto owns a small parcel of land which he inherited from his parents. He raises limes on that land and also has a small herd of sheep.

She will invest the remainder in her business. \r\n\r\nHer ambition is to diversify her business activities and to become a clothing wholesaler in Sanankoroba.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":928468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase various items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sanankoroba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T10:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874371},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283193},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424701},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139968},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-28T08:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756945},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-22T08:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251720},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410760},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448940},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502712},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":30643.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268391}],"funded_date":"2011-11-29T16:22:00Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":366827,"name":"Genda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Genda is 54 years old and lives in the Philippines.

The two men and ten women members of the 5 de Diciembre communal bank meet in Portoviejo every two weeks.  The members carry out a number of different business activities like general commerce, services, and others.  They joined their efforts to be able to access the benefits that the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir lends. This is the first cycle of their communal bank.

She is in a common-law-marriage and has three children; ages 11, 9, and 7.  The children all go to school.  Her husband is a bricklayer.  In addition to being a great housewife, she sells Avon products (perfume, creams, jewelry, and women\u2019s accessories) in order to earn something on her own.\r\n\r\nShe sells door to door, and she goes to work every day.  However, she only works in the mornings because it is much cooler then and her children are in school.  In the afternoons she has to help her little ones with their homework.  She leaves her products on credit, and she collects payments weekly.

She is 27 years old, she has finished 7th grade and she lives with and supports 5 people.  She is married.  She used to live with her parents and siblings and go to school.  In her free time she helped her mother with fishing work.  The family did without basic necessities due to lack of fishing nets which were constantly destroyed.  So she pursued a new source of income selling food from her home.  \r\n\r\n<p>She began fishing 10 years ago, without any formal training.  She employs 2 people, one of whom has children.  She intends to buy nets with the loan of 13,000 MT [meticals, the currency of Mozambique].  Her workday begins very early in the morning, depending on the tide, around 3 am and ends at 6pm.  She buys nets and equipment in Maputo and brings them home on public transport.  Winter is the most productive season with the best catches, and the product doesn't deteriorate as quickly.  Her average daily sale is 1,000 MT, with shrimp being the most lucrative catch.  \r\n\r\n<p> Her biggest challenge is the systematic destruction of nets due to ships and boats, which means the nets don't last as long as one would hope and which affect the size catch and the cost of materials.  With her profits, she pays salaries, supports her family and continues with the construction of her home.  In the future, she hopes to build a boat, but it will depend on her productivity, as it will only begin after she pays back this loan first.  She is happy with her work flow, which has improved since she was able to buy more nets with the last loan.  \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated by Bianca Vargas, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jossefa

is 27 years old and is originally from the north of Mozambique. His family moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro 13 years ago, and today only his father and an uncle lives here, the rest of the family is in Maputo (the capital). Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village in the boarder with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans. Married, Alexandre has a 2 years old daughter. He also helps to support his 2 younger brothers that are still in school. He has another younger brother that is working in South Africa. \r\n\r\nAlexandre studied until 6th grade (only 7th grade missing to finish primary school) and worked as a construction worker for almost 7 years. Soon after, he got a job as a gardener at Ponta D\u2019Ouro campsite, where he worked for 5 years earning MTN 1,200 monthly until January 2008. He decided to resign to focus in what he really likes to be: a photographer. Alexandre charges R15 (~US$1) for a regular size photo and between R50 and R100 (around US$5-10) for posters. He goes to Maputo every week to develop all pictures, paying MTn 300 (around US$15) for both ways transportation. With this business, Alexandre makes approximately MTn 3,500 per month. On top of that, Alexandre has 4 rooms that he rents, making up to MTn 1,500 per month, and still does some construction work when asked. \r\n\r\nThis is Alexandre\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku. This MTN 5,000 was used to build a grocery shop next to his house. He lives in a distant part of Ponta D\u2019Ouro, and believes all his neighbors will use his shop. At this first step, he will sell food and basic products. His wife will work at the shop, from 7am to 6pm daily, and will be able to continue to take care of the house. In the future, Alexandre dreams with a second Hluvuku loan to bring electricity to his shop, buy a fridge and start selling drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and meat.

She lives on Francisco de Miranda 1915 Street, in the La Esperanza Alta district, in the Trujillo province, of the department of La Libertad, in Peru. \r\n\r\nShe completed her secondary education but did not continue studying because her family did not have the economic resources for her to do so. She married Mr. Jes\u00fas Brise\u00f1o Benitez, and they have three children together, one of whom is a student and even still depends on her. \r\n\r\nIn the past, she would seek out shoe repair orders, while her husband was responsible for the actual repair. This transpired until she learned how to produce shoes herself and since then she takes part in the family repair shop. \r\n\r\nWith the first loan of 200 soles, which she repaid in four installments, she bought material to produce footwear. And with this loan of 500 soles, which she will repay in four installments, she will buy glue, leather, etc. Her grand dream is to bring her products to Argentina.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Larissa Kravanja, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":216875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of glue, leather, etc. for the footwear repair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Esperanza - Trujillo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-11-04T21:40:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Perpetua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T23:03:52Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":134.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951534},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":134.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224561},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":134.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417283},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":134.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110864}],"funded_date":"2008-11-04T23:03:52Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:14:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Larissa Kravanja","image":null}},{"id":75046,"name":"Mejra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mejra was born in 1969 and she lives in \u0160eri\u0107i, a village in Bosnia.

R. is a 28 year old man from a rural community of Costa Rica situated 45 kilometers south of San Jose, called San Cristobal Norte.  San Cristobal is a mountainous area where people make their living from such activities as business; cultivation of vegetables, coffee, and other crops; handicrafts; cattle, and many other activities.  Jose Mauricio is single and lives with his mom, his sister, and his nephew.  He owns a farm where he grows vegetables and has dairy cows for the production of milk.\r\nDairy farming is a business that he learned from his family; his parents have developed the business over many years.  At the present time, Jose Mauricio milks six cows, which takes up half of his time.  He wishes to purchase a milking machine which would save him a great deal of time and allow him to improve other aspects of the dairy operation.  Jose Mauricio sells milk and cheese to his neighbors in the community, and they have been very satisfied with being able to buy fresh products made in an atmosphere of trust by someone they know.\r\nJose Mauricio has been a member of the group Empresa de Credito Comunal San Crist\u00f3bal Norte (SACRIN) for eight years.  This is one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  During that time he has received 15 microloans in order to run his farm.  He has paid off each one responsibly.  At this time he is requesting a loan of $1,200 to buy the milking machine over 24 months to be paid in fixed installments each month.  His intention is to increase production in order to improve his quality of life and that of his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristy Placido, Kiva

To make a living, Joi owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling of \"Longganisa\" processed meat in the local community. Joi has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Joi joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Joi is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Joi from PMPC.

Loreta has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Loreta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Loreta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Loreta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Loreta from ASKI.

To do so, Tamar is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,000,000 from TLM to purchase new stock to be sold. She hopes that TLM is willing to help her in improving her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":729445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before L., there have been a lot of women borrowing money to buy and sell copper.  However, L. is still afraid of not being able to pay the weekly repayment.  Until recently (2007), she decided to borrow 200USD.  She uses that loan to buy and then cast copper.  Her income is 8 to 10 USD per day.

She lives in her own home along with her four children: Jaime, 22; Paulo, 20; Jes\u00fas and Domenica, 14; who are the motivation for all her efforts. Selling liquor is a very profitable business for Laura since the product is in high demand and her sales are always good. She tends to her home and that's also where she receives cases of liquor to sell direct from the factory. She also takes orders from distinct provinces in the region. What she most likes about her job is being able to tend to her business and also take care of her household duties at the same time. She has been doing this activity for five years and considers buying the liquor to be the most difficult part since there are many adult beverages and she has to know all the differences. For the future, she wants to have a big store where she can sell everything and not limit herself to just liquor.

The association was founded in 1993 by twenty female entrepreneurs in order to increase their purchasing power by means of a tontine (a revolving finance system whereby each member contributes periodically an agreed amount and these funds are passed on in rotation to different members). Since this policy does not allow for the financing of all members on the same day, they decided to join l'U-IMCEC (an association of mutual savings and loans institutions) in order to obtain a loan without being asked for guarantees. The members have thus formed sub-groups of five women, with a designated president and a treasurer for each sub-group. These sub-groups, of which there are currently 52, may remain the same for many years, but often change members in line with their needs and other considerations. The AFDE organises monthly members' meetings to which all the sub-groups are invited, and it manages a cooperative for its members, which allows them to buy rice and other products at a better price. The AFDE is run by a president whose name is Mrs. Mame Diarra MAR and a treasurer, Mrs.Ndeye Ndella Diouf, both residents of Thi\u00e8s.\r\n\r\nMrs. A\u00efssata N., married and mother of four children, is the president of AFDE sub-group N\u00b0 11. She has been running a business for the past seven years through the influence of a friend. Mrs. N. is 44 years old. She hopes that her activity will supplement the quite insufficient family income and improve living conditions for her children and her five-year-old grandchild she has under her care since she was born.\r\n\r\nShe sells food products such as fruit, jujube, \u2026\r\nHer sub-group also includes:\r\n\u2022\tMrs. CoumB. Laob\u00e9 B\u00e2, who sells thiouraye (incense)\r\n\u2022\tMrs. CoumB. Kant\u00e9, who sells charcoal, peanut butter, palm oil\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Awa S., who sells beauty products, and\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Fatou D., who sells breakfasts.\r\n\r\nThey are requesting a loan of 500,000 FCFA for their businesses, which will amount to 100,000 FCFA per person.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

Her good repayment performance with her previous loans means she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her welding business.     \r\n<br>To ensure the success of her business, Mercuria would like to apply for a loan of 30,000 PHP. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying equipment and welding materials.

","en":"Adel is married and lives in Tyre with his wife and 3 children. He is ambitious, and is tired of his van, which he uses for the work he\u2019s been doing since 2000; selling coffee, tea, and hookahs as a peddler, roaming from one village to the other in Tyre. Adel often settles in one location where his regular customers hang out. The quality of his product and his hygiene standards encourage many people, including friends, neighbors, and tourists, to buy his products. Adel has previously dealt with Al-Majmoua and has a good borrowing history. His previous loan had a positive impact on his life, as it significantly improved his financial situation. This time, Adel is planning to open a shop to sell and repair mobile phones, thus increasing his income and first and foremost improving the financial and social situation for his children and family. Adel aims to expand his business in the future to include a small caf\u00e9 in which his customers can gather.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Arabic by Rebecca Saab Saade, Kiva

Her husband is Wilfredo. He is her business partner and father to her only child. Eden, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEden operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Eden earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEden hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

One is doing her \u2018O\u2019 level exams this year and the other is enrolled at a college in Nairobi known as K.C.C.T. Apart from his two sisters, his aging diabetic mother also depends on him in taking care of her medical needs.\r\n\r\n<p>Robert started saving money when he was still employed as a clerk at the Metropolitan Hospital in the city of Nairobi. This was in the year 2005; through hard work, sacrifice, and determination, Robert managed to save Ksh 200,000 (USD 3075). With this money he bought two computers, a printer and a scanner; with the remaining money, he rented a stall in the heart of the town centre. He then started operating his computer bureau business in the year 2006, where he provides services in processing documents. Robert is always busy due to the location of his business, and he has managed to attract a large clientele. \r\n\r\n<p>In recent times, he has had an increase in the number of customers who need to get photocopies of documents.

Ulugoy is 40 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is married and the loving mother of four children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. \r\n<p>\r\nNow she dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle and with the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and her best friends. \r\n<p>\r\nUlugoy asks for a $1,000 loan with the term of nine months in order to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They live in their own home. Ten years ago he purchase a motorcycle car and since then he has been providing taxi services in the different areas of his region. Also, two years ago he got a motorboat and every weekend he fishes. Carlos is very happy with his businesses because they keep him busy and they give him the means to provide for his family. In the near future Carlos wants to set up a mechanic shop because he loves that kind of work and finds it very profitable.  He is mostly interested in repairing motorcycles and motorcycle cars, being the most common type of transportation in his region.  With MFP (Kiva Field Partner) has has had 3 loans and even though there have been some difference of opinion with his colleages at the Community Bank, Carlos remains with the same gruop because he knows these types of discussions happen. His will for self improvement and the success of the group remains.  The funds that he is requesting will be used to purchase spare parts for his motorcycle car.
