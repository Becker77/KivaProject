Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She has a vocational education and is a primary school teacher. She has also been a farmer since 1996. She currently has three dairy cows, eight sheep, ten goats, and 2.0 hectares of land where she grows clover, beans, and potatoes. She sells milk to local residents and wholesalers and earns 13,000 som (KGS) per month. She sends the animals out to pasture in the summer and keeps them in her barn during the winter. Her spouse and children actively help her around the farm. Nadira requested a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) from the bank Bai-Tushum to buy a cow. Having more livestock will improve her family's living conditions and give her children a higher

good principles, of which love and truthfulness are first and foremost. However, they also taught them to believe in God, and in his fairness. \r\n\r\nBeing the eldest, she had to help raise her other siblings, and this has transformed her into a second mother. However, she says that it has been difficult to confront life and fight alongside her parents to raise her other siblings, but that she has always put her trust in God. Her parents are together with her still, and some of her siblings; but life has given them satisfactions that fill her with happiness, knowing that she has helped to raise her younger siblings, supporting her parents in everything.\r\n\r\nLucila is a government employee, and she works in the local Health Unit. Since she has been working there, things have improved noticeably for her family and this has made their quality of life better.

She has a good reputation and people only have positive things to say about her. She is very friendly and hard-working and works as a teacher. Dinara began raising livestock in 1990 when she started out with 8,000 som (KGS). Dinara has been able to expand her business so that her monthly income is around 10,000 som (KGS). She currently has two dairy cows, ten sheep, and two horses. In order to continue expanding her farm, Dinara applied with the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase a cow so that she can sell more milk and dairy products. She plans to reinvest the profits in her farm and to buy a kitchen set.

She is a married woman of 30 years. She has a small family of five members: her husband; one son, age 27; and two daughters, ages 8 and 10. The member standing second from left with a raised hand is Mathua. \r\n\r\nMathua set up her cottage industry making and selling leaf plates in the market. Her husband drives a rented auto rickshaw in the town and earns their livelihood. Although he earns about 500 Indian rupees (INR) per day, he has to pay 300 INR per day to the owner of the auto rickshaw.\r\n\r\nHaving been through tremendous trials and tribulations herself, Mathua along with another three members of her locality formed a group to avail a loan and improve their businesses.

They are requesting a loan of 160,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nSabera is the leader of the group. She is a 54-year-old married woman with 9 children. Her oldest child is 30 years old and the youngest one is 18 years old. Sabera works as a dressmaker inside her house. She started in this business more than ten years ago in order to help her husband with the expenses of the family. The money that she earns from this business is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family. Sabera says that her house lacks many of home appliances and furniture that she can't afford. Unfortunately, she didn't have enough money to furnish the house.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Additionally, she sells roses and some other flowers.\r\n\r\nNazakat\u2019s income doesn't cover the family\u2019s live costs. She applied for a 1500 AZN loan in order to buy new garden tools and quality fertilizer for fruit trees and flowers. Besides that, she wants to supply new sorts of fruit for other seasons in order to make her income constant through the year.

This is Sarah. She is the Director of Kireka Hill Infant School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Kireka in Wakiso with 570 students. Kireka Hill Infant School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

This is Philip. He is the Director at Zana parents Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Zana, Wakiso District with 350 students. Zana Parents has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nZana Parents Primary School will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Philip ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.

She hast two children; both are already independent adults and live separately. Zhamablubu has received a college degree in education. For many years she has been teaching at the local school. In addition, for some 25 years she has been growing farm produce and raising livestock. Thanks to Zhamalbubu\u2019s hard work, she now has a land plot of 1.6 ha [4 acres], where she annually grows grains. She also has one cow, one calf, and 10 sheep. Her monthly revenue is 18,000 KGs. In order to develop her farm further, Zhamalbubu has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 60,000 KGS to buy mineral fertilizers and high-quality seeds. She also would like to use part of her loan to buy a cow. Zhamalbubu anticipates having a good harvest, which will certainly bolster her family\u2019s finances. Zhamalbubu would like to use the revenues resulting from her loan for an additional increase of livestock. She also plans to save up for her son\u2019s

Even as a youngster she liked baking and was able to go to school to learn more about this field. She learned how to make cakes, biscuits, pastries, and special breads. Her husband has always supported her, but it was difficult for her to continue her studies and take care of her family as well. \r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to open a small shop to the public where she can offer her cakes as well as meat pies, juices, and soft drinks. This will allow the quality of life that she has with her husband and three small daughters to improve. This is why she is requesting a loan to open a bakery with her husband. Her specialty is cake-making, and his is making meat pies. Both of them are prepared to work hard so their business will

Now, he is married and his wife works in the house, doing all of the household chores. He and his wife have two children, aged 15 and 13, who currently study. His mother-in-law also lives with him, so there are a total of 5 people in the household: Santos, his wife, his two children, and his mother-in-law.  \r\n\r\nSantos has always worked in agriculture, sowing grains, corn and beans. He and his wife do the farming and his children always help him when they have free time and when they are not in school. Since he was young, Santos has always farmed, thanks to his father who taught him to work the land.  His crops are close to his house; he only has to walk one kilometer to get to them.

This is the home of the famous Panama hat. The group is composed of 11 women and 2 men who decided to get together to form a communal bank. This has helped them a lot as with the loans they have been able to improve their small businesses and their living standard. They are very modest people who live on the little they make from their businesses. They have different activities in commerce, service and selling food.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Antonio who is 55 years old. He is divorced and has 4 children from this relationship. Two of them still live with their mother. Antonio is very hard-working who always likes to get ahead with his effort. He is a carpenter and buys and sells recyclable materials. He goes out every morning on his tricycle through the city collecting and buying cardboard, metal, cans, bottles, car batteries and any material that can be recycled. When he has a good quantity of these materials he takes them to a local recycler who buys them at a good price. So he makes his living in an honorable manner and can send money so that his children have food. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy cardboard, metal, cans, bottles and all types of recyclables. He has been in the communal bank for two cycles and likes the support he gets from the loans. His dream is to have a vehicle to do his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6500,"image":{"id":1601721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy cardboard, metal, tins, bottles and all types of recyclable materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-05-21T20:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-20T20:40:09Z","loan_amount":6500,"lender_count":196,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stefania Pilar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bella Pascuala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jubenil Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yuly Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos Milyton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Annabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelby Janeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6476.45,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":809.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":809.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":809.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":809.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":809.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":809.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":809.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":809.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":812.51,"local_amount":809.56,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T13:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":812.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490833010},{"amount":1625.02,"local_amount":1619.12,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1625.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504259057},{"amount":2437.5,"local_amount":2428.68,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541311},{"amount":1624.97,"local_amount":1619.09,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1624.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530024505}],"funded_date":"2014-05-22T18:36:22Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T12:09:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":711971,"name":"Poliito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poliito is a married, honest, and hardworking Ugandan man living in Kagadi.

Meet Tobiko, an ambitious, presentable, taut, 26-year-old Maasai Extension Officer at Juhudi Kilimo. Tobiko hails from Narosura, which is a settlement on an often neglected road in the semi-arid Rift Valley region of Kenya. He has been with Juhudi Kilimo for 15 months now. His work mainly entails training smallholder farmers. With a professional career that straddles science and agriculture, he gets the best of both worlds.<br \/><br \/>Tobiko is seeking a loan of KES 500,000 to pursue a Master\u2019s degree in Agricultural Information Management. He is very comfortable with the repayment period and monthly installments. <br \/><br \/>\u201cMy main role at Juhudi is to offer technical expertise and oversee the adoption of new training models for training small holder farmers in rural areas in conjunction with other experts in the industry. My zest in seeing productive farms and sustainable livelihood was born out of the community I belong to.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Tobiko was raised in a traditional Maasai community. He takes pride in coming from the independent pastoral tribe. Members of this tribe live off blood, milk and meat from their cattle.<br \/><br \/>Growing up, Tobiko keenly observed the changes in the world outside his community and understood the adaptations they have to embrace as a community in order to keep up with modernization. He sees a lot of opportunities in education and commerce to improve his community\u2019s livelihood.  <br \/><br \/>Tobiko passed high school exams with flying colors. He was admitted to the University of Nairobi, which is the largest university in Kenya. He selected an undergraduate degree course in agriculture to learn diverse farm practices that would help communities based in arid areas ensure food security. He specialized in animal science.<br \/><br \/>His first job was as a technical assistant in an agrochemical company where he sold animal pharmaceuticals and trained farmers in Narok, his home county. Later, he joined Juhudi Kilimo. <br \/><br \/>\u201cThe knowledge and skills I will gain from furthering my studies will enable me to conduct complex agricultural research. Through research, I will contribute to knowledge on agronomic practices. I will also be able to provide information on weather, \u2018drought-bursting\u2019 technologies, water resources, and livelihood diversification. All this is to ensure economic development and food security in remote areas in Kenya.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Your loan will equip Tobiko with relevant skills to better train Juhudi farmers. He will also use his expertise to help impact, motivate and inspire members of his community to become better pastoralists and diversify into more lucrative farming practices. <br \/><br \/>Today, Tobiko is also a self-driven entrepreneur. He made a worthwhile investment keeping dairy goats and growing tomatoes on his father\u2019s farm. As a first born, he wants to set the bar high for his siblings and others who look up to him.<br \/><br \/>His life\u2019s mission is to drive economic development and poverty alleviation in communities living in arid and semi-arid areas. \u201cThese communities face unique challenges such as drought, poverty, illiteracy, forced early marriages and poor health,\u201d he said.<br \/><br \/>In the next ten years, Tobiko sees himself being an agribusiness advisor, a policy maker and a big time farmer."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1526.72,"image":{"id":1607227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

That is when she decided to make and sell tortillas at the door of her house. Little by little she started saving with the money that she received and then started her own general store, without putting aside the thing that gave her the opportunity to grow: the sale of tortillas. Since then everything has progressed a bit slowly, but surely. \r\n\r\nPaula counts on her united family, who provide her with support: her husband, who works as a policeman, and her children, who look after the business when she cannot attend to it. The loan that she requests is to buy milk, sugar, rice, and basic grains like beans to be able to offer the best products to her customers. This will allow her to increase her sales and revenue and that way be able to meet her goal of having a larger and more diverse store. Paula's prospects have always been positive, and she is full of smiles when she asserts that this is what has allowed her to succeed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1601776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, sugar, rice, and basic grains like beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-05-22T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-21T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":254,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.32,"local_amount":29.85,"processed_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T16:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":32.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490876462},{"amount":29.15,"local_amount":26.92,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":29.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504303732},{"amount":68.83,"local_amount":63.57,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":68.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517586556},{"amount":28.64,"local_amount":26.45,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":28.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542563007},{"amount":71.14,"local_amount":65.71,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":71.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695639},{"amount":44.92,"local_amount":41.5,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":44.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579627373}],"funded_date":"2014-05-24T03:30:39Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:33:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gabriela L."}},{"id":708353,"name":"Jessica Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 24 a\u00f1os, Jesica ha tenido que trabajar con todo su esfuerzo lavando y planchando ropa de otros para pagar sus estudios de Licenciatura en Psicolog\u00eda en la UCN de Carazo.

This is the road of studying at the university. Rodolfo is 24 years old and he is at the point of completing his degree in accounting at the UCN university in Jinotepe. Previously he suffered an economic crisis and had to work as a teacher to pay his studies. But he continued moving forward, as he has always like accounting and he considers it an economic tool within the home and the basis for sustaining life. <br \/><br \/>Every Saturday he remembers his plans to create his own business or his next goals such as studying for a law degree. It is then when he has greater desire to succeed and finish his first degree. For this reason he seeks a loan to be able to pay for his licensing fees for his professional certificate.

is 44 years old and she is raising three children with her husband.  She has a specialized secondary education in the field of healthcare and for many years she used to work as a nurse.  However she is currently involved in agriculture and animal husbandry, two activities which constitute the main source of income for her family.  She started in this business in 2001 with an initial capital of 30,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, she now owns one dairy cow and 10 sheep.  She also has five hectares of land and annually grows beans which are consumed within the family or sold. \r\n\r\nAnara makes a gross income of about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy mineral fertilizers, bean seeds and fuel.  She intends to get a good harvest from her land.  She would also like to increase her cattle headcount, which will directly lead to an increase in the family's capital.  She plans to invest the earnings from her loan to pay for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1594444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Each month, she makes 20,000 som (KGS) from her sewing business and the sale of milk.  In order to further develop her activity, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" and requested a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy some calves and increase her cattle headcount.  She plans to re-invest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her cattle headcount.  She would also like to save some money to build a large barn for her livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1594458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Industrial kitchens, making bathroom fixtures, refrigerated display cases, and other products are what he makes and sells in his home and in a local market. He began assembling food displays and artisan kitchens 20 years ago, but he saw the necessity to create a job that supported his family. Nevertheless, he saw beyond the assembly alone and his creative process began to emerge.

With this loan, she will purchase cloth in bulk to sell to customers. Her future plan is to construct a house and to provide a higher education for her children. She is very happy and thankful to Kiva's lenders for this support.\r\n\r\nThe other member of this group is involved in a different business activity; the other member is involved in health drugs (chemical shop).

She started in this business in 1988.  Thanks to her perseverance and hard work, she now owns two dairy cows and 1.2 hectare of land on which she annually grows peppers, beans and strawberries for the family's consumption and for resale.  Akylai makes a gross monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" and requested a loan of 80,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to hire farm workers to pick strawberries, and also to buy livestock.  After the harvest, Akylai plans to buy more livestock for further resale, as this will allow her to make nice profits and will, in turn, lead to an increase in the family's capital.

They have various small businesses that they are sustaining and expanding.\r\n\r\nBerta is a 25-year-old married member of the Trust Bank. She has one son who is 16 months old. Along with her husband, Berta is very hard-working as the goal of the couple is to provide a better life for their son and future children. Recently, she began her business which involves the manufacture and sale of a variety of iced fruit popsicles that she sells three days each week from her home and also in a nearby school. Berta is very excited to be requesting her first loan from Friendship Bridge which she will use to purchase a many kinds of fruit and transform it into icy treats. Her goal is to expand her business so that her popsicles will be more in demand.\r\n\r\nFriendship Bridge strongly believes that loans must be accompanied by non-formal educational trainings for the over 20,000 women who are clients of the organization. This is called \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer meets monthly with the women of each Trust Bank and shares information on useful and relevant topics like nutrition, hygiene and health, women\u2019s rights and self esteem as well as effective business practices and budgeting. Because most of the ladies have had little or no education, they are very excited to learn all that they can. They also realize how essential a good education is for their children.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on behalf of the 10 other women in the \u201cUvas\u201d Trust Bank, Berta expresses appreciation to KIVA investors for their kindness and generosity in providing capital for their much-needed loans. Armed with their new tools, the ladies are poised to step into a brighter future, benefitting themselves, their families and their

Chichicastenango is a large and colorful town located in the Highlands and it is well-known for its large weekly market, Mayan customs and traditions. Several years ago, the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cChutzoropence\u201d meaning \u201cPeople from Chutzorop\u201d was formed here. Chutzorop is a small community, near Chichicastenango, where the principle language is the Mayan dialect of \u201cKiche\u201d. Spanish is not spoken by many in the village.\r\n\r\nTomasa is the 28-year-old President of the Trust Bank. She is married and has three children. Two of them are in school. Tomasa is honored to be President of the Trust Bank in this new loan cycle. She is pleased to practice her leadership skills. Tomasa has a textile business and creates shawls as well as the colorful and ornate traditional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d that the women wear from Chichicastenango. They are among the most beautiful in Guatemala. Tomasa is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase a variety of good quality thread as she wants to maintain the high quality of her business and increase her clientele. She delivers her inventory weekly and sells on a retail basis two days in the local market.\r\n\r\nThe women understand the value of education and know that their children need to be in school in order to enjoy a better and more prosperous future. Participating in the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge (small loans + non-formal education), the ladies learn about many useful and relevant subjects from a Loan Officer at their monthly meetings. Some of the topics discussed include violence against women and self-esteem, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights as well as nutrition and health. In addition, subjects like effective business practices, customer service, budgeting and accounting are essential to insure the success of their small businesses.\r\n\r\nTomasa feels honored that people from other parts of the world want to invest not only in her but also in the 10 other ladies in the Trust Bank. The women have formed a strong alliance and together, they are committed to making a real difference in the lives of their families and their community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5250,"image":{"id":1607553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a variety of good quality thread for making shawls.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJosephine hopes that her business will last longer and dreams that her children will finish their education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.

The president of the group is Alice (seen with her hand raised in the photo).  She is 54 years old, has never attended school and is married to Andr\u00e9.  They have six children who all attend school, and they are responsible for five of the children.  Alice and Andr\u00e9 live with their children and, between them, they provide for the needs of their household.  To help to do this, Alice has been selling cassava flour, rice and fish at a market in Benin for nearly twenty years.  She buys her supplies in Benin.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the group would like to increase their working capital and improve their businesses so they work with the field partner, Alid\u00e9.  This will be their second loan.  Alice and the other group members will use their loans to grow their businesses, attract more customers and increase their profits.

She has a higher education and has been working as a math teacher in a school for many years. To earn extra money for her family, she also works in animal husbandry, a business she began 10 years ago with the purchase of 30 sheep for 120,000 KGS. She now has two milking cows and 85 sheep, with a monthly income of 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Kalicha has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase lambs for eventual resale. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her livestock head count, and wants to save toward her daughters'
