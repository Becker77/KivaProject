His level of education is very low since, at that time, the school was located very far away, his parents did not have the money for education expenses, and it was not a priority.\r\n\r\nHe is married and his wife takes care of the household duties. Out of all of his children, only one of them currently lives with them since the others now have their own households. For his whole life, Silvino has worked in agriculture and grown sugar cane. His father taught him this business since it is a very profitable business in the are. He leaves very early in the morning to work and works until it gets dark.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to purchase agricultural supplies like manure, seeds, fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides for his corn crops and to maintain his sugar cane crops. This will be beneficial because he will be able to have a very good production that will allow him go grow economically and provide his family with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to

He has been managing a photography business for six years now, since 2008. He is a married man in his early forties, with two children in school. From the beginning of his business, he has offered his services by walking door to door. He runs his service from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every working day and is able to make a fair monthly profit.\r\n\r\nCleophas now wants to rent a place where people can find him specifically to get a service. He think that by having a physical address, it will be easier to mobilize more customers and to create other opportunities, like selling photo frames and camera accessories and taking videos for different functions, because customers will know where to find him. \r\n\r\nThis is Cleophas' first loan from Tujijenge Tanzania, as Kiva's partner, which he will use to rent a room for his photography service. He dreams of managing a company and employing youth who are jobless. He will share this loan with his loan group, Mbogo, which has three members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

The total amount of her entire group loan is 3,800,000 KHR. 1,200,000 KHR is her loan portion. As the leader, she will spend her entire loan portion to pay for plowing fees and to buy good seed.

studied up to the third grade, but abandoned his studies because his parents were not able to provide studies as he would have liked. He started working tending to a family member's cattle and farming. He has been married for 13 years, but, before marrying, lived for 20 years with his current wife. Together they gave birth to 3 children all of which studied only up to the 9th grade because he was not able to provide them more studies because he did not have the necessary income to cover the home's expenses as well as studies for them. They all work in farming as a family to sustain the home. \r\n\t\r\nHe has been farming since his childhood, his parents taught him this job because they were also farmers. He also tends cattle because as a boy he would take care of a neighbor's cattle in the off-season, when he could not farm the land with his father, and learned a lot. He started farming seeing that this field of work provided the necessary income to sustain his family. His work is a 30 minute walk from his house and is a plot of land where he farms corn and beans which he uses to feed his family on time every day. \r\n\r\nWith the loan he will purchase the fertilizer and herbicides for his crops and will pay for the labor of the people who help him farm. In this way he will have the grain on time at home, he will see a small margin of savings because buying everything all at once will make it cheaper and the transportation to his residence will be cheaper because he has to hire a vehicle to transport everything from the city to his home and paying for it separately is more expensive. With the product at home he will be able to farm and apply the fertilizers to his crops on time and be able to have a good production of grains which his family will use during the summer season for consumption.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wants to reconstruct his residence to give his family better living conditions. He hopes his children are able to form their own families and they are close as he is with them. He also hopes to have a really successful production of corn and beans and in that way give his family the grains for consumption and also from his harvest sell a portion in order to start realizing his dreams little by little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1602688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"purchase fertilizer and herbicides for his crops and pay for the labor of people who help him farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-22T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-21T16:40:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoriano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":296.35,"local_amount":296.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":296.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201889},{"amount":703.65,"local_amount":703.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":703.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650535977}],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T15:21:16Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Samuel Martinez","image":null}},{"id":712460,"name":"Jesus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesus is 50 years old.

advance studies. She was accompanied, but has been single for 15 years. Her husband abandoned her and left her to care for her children having his help only for a certain time. Her children have studied up to high school thanks to her efforts which have allowed her to give them this level of study. The oldest works in farming and is accompanied, but lives with her. The daughter works in the production of handicrafts. \r\n\t\r\nSantana takes care of the chores at home and works in the production of hammocks and canvas bags. She learned this trade from her parents who, seeing as they could not give her the studies she deserved, made sure to teach her a job with which she could provide for her children's studies and the home's expenses. She has also worked as a housekeeper in various places which has given her the opportunity to met many people who always lend her a helping hand. In farming she is helped by her son and in the weaving by her daughter. The daily work schedule varies. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she will purchase fertilizer, herbicides and pay off the manpower she uses to farm 3,500 square meters of corn and beans. If she can have all the money on time she will be able to purchase everything at once and at a more affordable price than if she were to purchase separately. As the planting season nears she will have all the necessary supplies to plant the basic grains on time. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to make some repairs to her home in the future as her family is growing. She also hopes to have a good harvest and that the effort she is putting in right now will be rewarded with a good output which will allow her to have enough for the dry season during which no farming can be done.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1602693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"purchase fertilizer, herbicides and pay off the manpower she uses to farm 3,500 square meters of corn and beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-22T17:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-21T17:00:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santana Anidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803783}],"funded_date":"2014-06-18T15:49:24Z","paid_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Samuel Martinez","image":null}},{"id":712455,"name":"Hoey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a rural village of the Battambang province\u2019s Koh Krolor district, Hoey is 53 years old and married with two children.

Sharshenkul has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Sharshenkul works with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding, after having started in 1998 with 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Sharshenkul's purposefulness, hard work and responsibility, she currently has a dairy cow, three calves, eight sheep, one horse and one foal. She has a spacious barn to keep the cattle in, and she has also purchased fodder and hay. In addition, Sharshenkul and her family also work with field crop cultivation. They grow clover, beets and beans for own use and sale on their plot of land of 1.20 hectares. The total monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Sharshenkul turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows. She will also spend part of the money on the purchase of fertilizers and different high quality seeds. Sharshenkul intends to increase the number of cattle, which will led to an increase in the family's capital and enable her to save money for marrying away her son.

Her parents didn't want her to attend school at a time which was filled with delinquency. She has been married for the last 14 years and her husband works as a security guard in the city. With him, Ana has procreated 2 daughters, one of whom is 11 years old and in the 7th grade, while the other is 5 and in the 1st grade. They are a very united family, even though her husband's work doesn't allow him to spend much time at home. She has to take change of all household obligations.\r\n\t\r\nAna does all the household tasks and, in addition, administers her small store by means of which she adds to household earnings. This way, she doesn't feel so dependent on her husband. This skill she learned some 6 years ago while working in a store. Then she decided to establish her own store in her house where she could sell and care for the family at the same time. Ana also, in addition to her store, sells products by catalog which produce extra income to cover her personal expenses. She is the only person involved in the store, because her husband lacks the time to do so due to his work.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ana will purchase fertilizers and herbicides for cultivating corn and to pay laborers. Since her husband doesn't have time to cultivate the earth, she grows corn and beans with the help of workers she searches for to do the tasks. With the loan, Ana will buy all the agricultural inputs needed at one time at a lower price, receiving a small savings on the purchase. By having all this in her house at the moment of application to the crops, she will not have to go looking for fertilizers. Rather, she will be able to transfer the chemicals directly from home.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Ana wants her store to continue growing more and more to have a better monetary income with earnings from sales. She wants her daughters to complete their studies, which was denied her by her parents, and for them to have stable, well-remunerated work. And, Ana wants her agricultural efforts to be  well compensated with an abundance of production, so that her family can sustain themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1602708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy fertilizers and herbicides for cultivating corn and to pay farm workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-22T18:20:37Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-21T18:20:37Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maril\u00fa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":159.42,"local_amount":159.42,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":159.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683483945},{"amount":340.58,"local_amount":340.58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":340.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730975973}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T15:08:05Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:59:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":712481,"name":"Elsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsa owns and operates a retail business to earn a living.

Having started in 2008 with a purchase of 1 calf, today she has 2 dairy cows in her business, and a profit of about 18,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and milk products. In order to further develop her business, Begimai requested a loan in the amount of 75,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy bulls for fattening up. Begimai plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock headcount and building a large house for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1595280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

In search for an additional source of income for her family, Zamira started her own business of breeding livestock in 2000, having started with a sum of 8,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her drive, persistence and hard work, Zamira was able to grow her business to have a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS). Today Zamira's business contains 4 dairy cows and 15 sheep.  In order to further develop her business, Zamira requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a cow and sheep.

Sonunbu has finished technical college. For many years has been working at the local school. As an additional source of income for her family, Sonunbu raises livestock, having first started in 1984. Thanks to Sonunbu\u2019s hard work and dedication, her farm now includes five cows, 18 sheep and one horse. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to develop her farm further, Sonunbu has applied to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 30,000 KGS to increase her livestock by buying a cow. This will allow her to increase her revenues from selling milk and dairy products. Sonunbu plans to use the resulting revenue for an additional increase of livestock.

Hassana attended Koranic school but dropped out early, while he was still a child, in order to get involved in income-generating activities.  He tried several activities without much success, before focusing on selling candy, chocolates, sugar, powdered milk, cigarettes, tea and cookies.  He learned this activity 15 years ago from one of his uncles.\r\n\r\nIn order to boost his business and strengthen his sales capacity, Hassana has decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, and this is his first individual loan.

She has three children and lives with her husband in his polygamous family in the Djicoroni neighborhood of Bamako.  Because of unfortunate family circumstances, she dropped out of school when she was still very young and she has been involved in income-generating activities ever since.  She tried several activities without much success before starting to sell food, an activity she learned 15 years ago from her mother.  Minata is well known because she cooks the best food in her neighborhood.  In order to increase her business and boost her sales capacity, she has decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and this is her first loan.  She is planning to use this loan to buy new stocks of merchandise (one bag of potatoes, three packets of spaghetti and one basket of tomatoes) from condiments sellers at the market.  Minata resells her food in Dibida.  Her customer base consists of both men and women and they pay her in cash or on credit. Thanks to this loan, she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 40,000 CFA francs which will be used to repay the loan's interest to Soro Yiriwaso, meet her family's needs and reinvest the rest of the money in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1607134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy food (potatoes, spaghetti, tomatoes) for the preparation of dishes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-05-23T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-22T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-06-17T19:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25922.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":490961212},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-18T09:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25922.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504677603},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25922.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677290},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25922.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530210048},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":25922.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658769},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":25922.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561792960}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T06:16:41Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T15:12:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":708960,"name":"Juan Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Juan tiene 45 a\u00f1os, tiene tres hijos de las edades de 5, 9 y 10 a\u00f1os,  el se dedica a la venta  de comida y almuerzo este negocio lo realiza junto a su esposa tiene su puesto de venta en la zona de Plan 3000 de la ciudad de santa Cruz, este pr\u00e9stamo es su primera secuencia con la instituci\u00f3n,  El se\u00f1or Juan va a usar este pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mesas y sillas para  su negocio, su raz\u00f3n para solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo es que  El se\u00f1or Juan necesita esto para brindar mayor comodidad a sus clientes que en ocasiones comen parados, El se\u00f1or Juan enfrenta retos en su negocio que son que  tiene que levantarse muy temprano cuando hace  frio para ayudar a su esposa preparar su comida,  que es propensa a agarrar reumatismo el cual es muy frecuente en personas con esa actividad,  va a utilizar los beneficios en comprar insumos y ofrecer a sus clientes un buen servicio su deseo  para su negocio es el de tener una pensi\u00f3n de comida variada m\u00e1s grande donde pueda vender m\u00e1s y mejor y poder superarse en la vida.","en":"Juan is 45 years old and has three children ages 5, 9 and 10.

world! Meet Erick, a resilient, big, 28-year-old, Kenyan, Business Development Officer at Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organisation serving Kenyan rural smallholder farmers. He has spent all his life in Nasianda which is a very small village in the foothills of Mt. Elgon in Trans-zoia County. For a year now, he has been training and helping small-scale rural farmers find loans to acquire income-generating assets such as dairy animals, poultry and farm equipment. \r\n\r\nEric is soliciting a loan to take a Strategic Management Degree Course at Mount Kenya University. \r\n\r\nThe reason Erick is seeking an education loan is because the high cost of going to a quality university is quite prohibitive. Besides, Erick and his family are going through a series of misfortunes. His family lost the land they grew up on and in which they had invested 20 years of blood, sweat and tears, following the post-election feuds in 2007. His father lost all his retirement savings trying to seek justice. This incident deprived Erick off his opportunity to go to college. Moreover, Erick\u2019s mother has been diagnosed with Arthritis, a condition which had paralyzed her for 12 years. She underwent a 10-hour operation at the start of the year which led the hospital bill to go through the roof. To date, the family is struggling to take care of the KES 900,000 hospital bill. \r\n\r\nAfter high school, Erick was forced to get a paying job to support his family and worked as an untrained teacher. The meagre salary only afford him a Business Administration diploma course from an institution that had long lost government funding. He later moved to a private college where he completed the diploma course in 2010. \r\n\r\nHis first official job was with a suitcase manufacturing company in Mombasa. He later joined National Bank as an intern. After six months, he started working with Trans Kenya Sacco. It was here that he made up his mind never to be a corporate sellout by only working for social enterprises. Erick later learned about Juhudi Kilimo\u2019s impact on his community and decided to apply for a job. \r\n\r\n\u201cI believe so much in investing time and other resources in lives of people. When I saw an advert for Juhudi Kilimo Company, I couldn't resist jumping on the opportunity. After going through their website, learning about their core values, mission and vision, I decided this is the company I want to work with. Acquiring the knowledge from degree course in strategic management, will help me adapt to the changes in internal and external environment of my company. Building my capacity and fully exploiting my talents, skills, expertise and passion will not only help me have more impact on smallholder farmers but also take bigger challenges in my career.\u201d\r\n\r\nHopeful and undeterred, Erick is focused on a better tomorrow filled with dreams, accomplishments and opportunities. Holding it together when everyone else would understand if he falls apart is Erick\u2019s sign of true strength. \r\n\r\nErick's favourite quote is from Nelson Mandela: \"Education is the engine of personal development, it is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that the child of a farm worker can become the president of a great nation\".\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1526.72,"image":{"id":1607018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
