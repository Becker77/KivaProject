This will lead to an improvement in her children\u2019s education and also in her family\u2019s living standards. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1608227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-05-23T14:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-22T14:00:09Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1886.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2342.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2380.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2444.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2529.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2578.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2662.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2719.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2792.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2891.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3027.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.8,"local_amount":9634.48,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10161.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054250},{"amount":31.07,"local_amount":2585.25,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2726.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547782},{"amount":31.83,"local_amount":2648.15,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2792.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561681016},{"amount":31.41,"local_amount":2613.23,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2756.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625482},{"amount":33.37,"local_amount":2776.18,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2928,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194891},{"amount":120.47,"local_amount":10942.71,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11541.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.05,"payment_id":711505014}],"funded_date":"2014-05-23T18:44:28Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":712753,"name":"Leonidiza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonidiza operates a farm, growing and harvesting rice for sale.

He is married and has two children aged twelve and three. In 2011, Mohamed Chernor established his business selling extension cables, light bulbs, mobile phone accessories, switches, CDs and pure water. \r\n\r\nHe began his business because he dropped out of school after Year 3 and began to learn carpentry but was not much interested in carpentry. He made some hangers and sold them, and the money he gathered was used to start a cosmetics business. Mohamed then changed his cosmetics business into a business selling phone accessories and electrical items because his profits in the cosmetics business were low. \r\n\r\nMohamed's current business is located in the city center and his main customers are young women and men around town. He works fifteen hours a day, seven days a week. He would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL in order to buy more mobile phone accessories and electrical items. He hopes that this loan will help him attract more customers. In future, Mohamed plans to complete his building and educate his children. This loan will help him achieve his plans.

He will be able to save some money with these purchases because he can transport it all at once and it will be less expensive.  He will also have it at his home and can apply it to his crops when he needs to and have better production.\r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to have a better built home because his current one is metal and he wants to build one out of cinder blocks so he can provide better security and living conditions for his family.

She began her business because she realized it was the only means for her survival and better living standards for her and her family. Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are adults. Working 6 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 2,000,000 SLL every month from this business.\r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL.

She is married and has four children aged 7, 11, 18 and 26. She has two additional dependents who live with her just to help with their education. In 2011, Haja Jaka established her textiles business. She began her business just to be self reliant and help her husband run the affairs of the home. Her business is located in city center and her main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,945,000 every month from this business.

Her idea for the business was born four years ago when she felt the need to improve their wellbeing.  She started selling food that she prepared herself and little by little she was able to build a small group of customers.

Now he would like to start a feed sales business, because a majority of his community works raising cattle.

Then, lack of economic resources caused her to work from a very young age to provide for herself. Despite having a job that demands much time and effort, she also takes care of her house and children because her husband works outside of the city. Rosario lives with her children and husband in the city of Latacunga, in the Eloy Alfaro parish, in the Latacunga canton, located in the province of Cotopaxi.\r\nRosario has been a clothing merchant for several years. She works weekends and also when she has free days; she also works at a baby clothing store.\r\nRosario, through the experience she has acquired from several years, is experiencing growth in her business.

The ladies are quite happy to welcome two new members to the group. They are also looking forward to securing new loans to sustain and expand their small businesses.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is 52-year-old Maria, who is married and has nine children. She has had six years of formal education. Maria is involved in various productive activities with the goal of generating enough income to meet her large family's daily needs, including their education needs. Maria's businesses include poultry (purchase and sale of chickens), tamales (on weekends) and products made from palm leaves. Maria is requesting a new loan which she will use to purchase additional chickens, spices for her tamale business and materials for her palm leaf creations.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of the clients of Friendship Bridge place a high priority on education, both for themselves and for their children. They are keenly aware that knowledge is a powerful tool and opens up many new opportunities. They understand that education is essential to realize a better and more prosperous life. Four of Maria\u2019s children are in school and she works very hard to pay for all of their school expenses, including their uniforms and supplies. Her highest hope is that they graduate and find successful careers and enjoy more success than she has been able to achieve. \r\n\r\nThe ladies in the Trust Bank meet each month with a Trust Bank officer who presents non-formal participatory educational trainings. The women are eager to learn about effective business practices, including accounting, budgeting and customer service as well as women\u2019s rights and self esteem. They also learn about nutrition and health as well as the use of medicinal plants. It is the combination of the loans and education that comprises the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cLas Trenceras\u201d Trust Bank extends gratitude to KIVA investors for believing in them and investing in their loans. They are committed to working hard, empowering themselves and stepping into a brighter and more prosperous

is the name of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank in a rural area of Momostenango, Guatemala. It is made up of ten closely-knit women who form a strong allliance. There are two new members in the Trust Bank. Their small businesses include animal husbandry and traditional textile production.\r\n\r\nDunia is the 25 year old Secretary of the Trust Bank. She is married and has four children. She has had five years of formal education and her friends in the group have great confidence in her ability to keep track of what transpires in the monthly meetings. Dunia sells cosmetics like make-up, lip balm, creams, and perfumes to her friends, neighbors, and relatives. She is requesting a new loan to increase her inventory and generate additional income.\r\n\r\nEach month, Dunia and her fellow Trust Bank members participate in educational trainings presented by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. The ladies are eager to learn about managing their loans successfully and so topics like accounting, budgeting and customer service are very relevant and useful. Also discussed are subjects like health and nutrition, medicinal plants, and self-esteem. Friendship Bridge characterizes the combination of the loans and the education component as Microcredit Plus. It is unique to this organization in Guatemala. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Dunia and the women are aware of the value of education for their children and this goal motivates them to succeed in their businesses. Indigenous women typically complete less than two years of schooling. Experts estimate that for every ten students who begin first grade in rural Guatemala, fewer than three will continue on to seventh grade, and only one will complete tenth grade. Family members must purchase textbooks, uniforms, and other necessary materials for their young students. \r\n\r\nKIVA investors are greatly valued and appreciated by the clients of Friendship Bridge. Empowered by the acquisition of new knowledge and their small loans, these women can envision a successful and more prosperous future for their small rural community in Momostenango, their families and themselves. Thank you, KIVA investors!"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1608982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to increase her cosmetics inventory.

Bridge Trust Bank composed of ten hard-working women in Guatemala. Their average age is 39 years and their average number of children is five. Most of them have had an average of three years of formal education, as their priority since childhood has been to help to support their families. The women are strongly motivated to empower themselves and eliminate poverty. They are happy to be members of the Trust Bank and thus, the name \u201cLa Felicidad\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe group is in its second loan cycle and has elected 24 year old Gloria as their Secretary. Gloria has completed her primary school education and is married with two small children. She easily carries out her role as Secretary and makes her fellow Trust Bank members feel confident in her abilities. She only speaks the language of her community which is \u201cel kich\u00e9\u201d.\r\n\r\nAlong with her husband, Gloria has been selling shoes for several years. She has shoe stalls in two different markets in her community. Because her business is increasing, Gloria is requesting a loan which she will use to purchase additional inventory, increase her earnings and offer her children a better future. She realizes that they are still quite young but can see a more prosperous and successful future for them with more opportunities. The couple is laying the foundation now.\r\n\r\nEach month, the ten women of the \u201cFelicidad\u201d Trust Bank participate in non-formal educational trainings provided by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. The ladies are eager to learn about so many topics like self esteem and women\u2019s rights, medicinal plants, nutrition and health. They immediately apply new knowledge about effective business practices, accounting and budgeting to their small businesses. Customer service is another relevant and useful subject for them.\r\n\r\nThank you, KIVA investors, for your kindness and generosity in providing funding for the small loans of these women. You are valuable partners in the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge and our over 20,000 clients!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1609008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more shoes to sell.

She has 3 children. Aside from her, her partner (to whom she is not married), her 3 children and her mother-in-law all live in her home. She shares the household expenses with her partner. She dedicates herself to selling food for breakfast, lunch and dinner and works 10 hours a day. She has been in this business for two years and serves a great number of people daily who come to her stall mainly because of the great flavour of the food. Nancy mentions that she is proud of what she does as with her work she has been able to support her family. Before she began her business she was a beautician, however she had to stop that line of work when her husband had an accident and she no longer had enough time for it. Mrs. Nancy saw that the sale of food was more profitable. She was forced to use her talents in the kitchen to start her business which has to date given her many satisfactions, including being able to give her children good nutrition and education.\r\nNancy feels excited about her loan from EDAPROSPO and with it she will be able to buy more ingredients to make the food for her business as she is experiencing high demand.
