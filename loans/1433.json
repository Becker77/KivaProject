She is married to Gerry, a driver, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEvelyn operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round, palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers create every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread, and other materials for her business.\r\n\r\nEvelyn hopes to expand her business and dreams for her children to finish their studies.

It consists of four women who are all hard working. They live in Hodeidah, Yemen. They have taken a loan of 140,000 YER. \r\n\r\nMona is a 29-year-old divorced woman with three children. Her oldest child is nine years old and the youngest one is four years old. She studied in elementary school, but she couldn't complete her studies. She is a very active and dynamic woman. She has a strong determination to look after her children. After getting a divorce from her husband, she decided to start her own business in order to cover her children with the necessary needs. In the beginning, she started with a small amount of money that she had saved herself.  Mona invested that money in her own business. She worked in that business for two years selling ready-made women's clothes. She sees this business as a profitable one for her.

Since her husband died, she has been raising seven children by herself.  She has a specialized secondary education and is a retailer by profession.  However, for the past 35 years, she has been working in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. Thanks to her hard work, she currently owns six dairy cows, 40 sheep, three horses and five goats.  In addition to her livestock, she also owns a mill and a tractor and makes an additional income by providing services to the local residents.  She makes a gross monthly income of over 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy sheep and increase her livestock headcount.  She is planning to re-invest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her number of domestic animals.  She also intends to save enough money to educate her youngest daughter.

Mohanad lives with his family in Taiz, Yemen. He studied until secondary school but could not complete his study. Recently, he works as a driver in his minibus. <br \/><br \/>In the beginning, Mohanad decided to improve the condition of his family by opening a cafeteria.  Although he could accumulate a good amount of money from his cafeteria, he found that business unsuitable for him. Then he decided to sell it and purchasing a minibus for transportation. He has started in this business for one year as a driver. Mohanad found this business to be profitable. He works most of his time as a driver. <br \/><br \/>His bus became old and needs daily maintenance. He earns good profits from this business. Unfortunately, most of what he earns from this business goes to repairing the bus, but he does not have enough money for that. For this reason, he applied for a loan of 100,000 YER from AMB.

","en":"Chinara is 43 years old, married, with five children. Chinara has received secondary education. From 1992 she has been working as a farmer. She had only 30,000 KGS as a starting capital. At present Chinara's farm includes two dairy cows, one sheep, one horse and one goat. Chinara also provides a service herding other people's livestock. Her monthly income is about 10,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Chinara has applied to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 20,000 KGS to buy a cow. She plans to use the rest of the loan for growing farm produce, and specifically to buy high-quality barley and sainfoin [a herb used for animal fodder] seeds and also mineral fertilizers. These steps will allow Chinara to increase her income and allow her to save up for her daughter's

She has a secondary education and she knows how to make wise financial decisions to achieve the goals she has set for herself.  She has been working in agriculture and animal husbandry for the past 18 years, two activities which provide her family with its main source of income. She currently owns four dairy cows.  She gets feed and hay from her own fields.  She also has 1.5 hectare of land on which she and her family grow watermelons for resale.  This year, Orozgul and her family are also planning to sow some rice.  Orozgul makes a monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and agricultural crops.  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy a horse for farm work as well as high quality seeds and mineral fertilizers, which will help her to get a good harvest in the fall.  Orozgul is planning to re-invest the earnings from her loan into further expanding her farming business.  She would also like to save enough money to build a house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1595668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a horse, seeds and mineral fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sary-Kolot village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-05-25T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-24T09:40:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orozgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T08:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25172.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463308},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":25172.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578489},{"amount":456.41,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":25172.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.09,"payment_id":610751308},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25172.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513576}],"funded_date":"2014-06-16T19:15:14Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:38:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":713472,"name":"Fotemogoban A Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les 10 membres du groupe FOTEMOGOBAN A sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 37 ans et ont en moyenne 6 enfants et vivant la plupart  dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 KOKOUNA un village dans la commune de SANZANA  dans le cercle de SIKASSO 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur cinqui\u00e8me pr\u00eat solidaire avec l\u2019institution de microfinance soro yiriwaso, les pr\u00eats pass\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est  le sorgho  avec  FANTA debout au milieu.sur la photo dans ce groupe de femme. \nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter un sac de 50 kg d\u2019engrais, 1 bidon d\u2019herbicide et payer les frais de labour  pour entretenir 0,5 hectare. \nApr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte la production est vendue au niveau du village, au march\u00e9 de SIKASSO \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019homme et de femme au comptant et \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de  73 000 FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer d\u2019une part son pr\u00eat et son int\u00e9r\u00eat et d'autre part aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes de la famille.\n","en":"The ten members of the Fotemogoban A group are married women who, on average, are 37 years old and have six children.

She has a secondary education and has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture for the past 24 years, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She currently owns three dairy cows and 12 sheep, and also has 0.90 hectare of land on which she cultivates cotton which she sells to buyers in bulk quantities.  She makes a monthly income of about 10,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and cotton.  In order to further develop her farming business, Gulchehra has turned to the \"Bai Tushum\" bank for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy cotton seeds, mineral fertilizers and pesticides for farm work.  Thanks to these purchases, she will be able to improve her soil fertility and get a better harvest.  Gulchehra is planning to re-invest her profits into further expanding her farming business, which will improve the overall living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1595672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

raising two children with her husband.  She has a secondary education and works in agriculture and animal husbandry, two activities which provide her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business in 1990 with the purchase of two calves.  Thanks to her determination, hard work and perseverance, she currently owns two dairy cows, two calves, two horses and eight sheep.  She makes an average monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  She has turned to the \"Bai Tushum\" bank for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) and will use her loan to buy young bulls.  Part of the money will also be used to buy fuel for spring field work and the preparation of feed for her livestock.  Begaiym is planning to increase her cattle headcount, which will directly lead to an increase of the family's capital.  She is also planning to use her profits to buy a plot of land, so that her son can build a

","en":"Kenzhekan is 52 and married with two adult children who live on their own. She has a high school education and has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture for 22 years as the primary source of income for her family. She now has one milking cow, one calf and 15 sheep as well as everything necessary to take care of them, including feed and hay. In the summer the animals go out to pasture and in the winter they stay in the barn. Kenzhekan also has a piece of land on which she grows corn, clover and potatoes for sale. In addition, she has two small mills, thanks to which she can offer services grinding corn and sunflower seeds to local residents. Her total monthly income is about 18,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Kenzhekan has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy calves. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her livestock head count and into improving her living

He is 29 years old and he is married. He lives with his parents, who are retired. Both of them are pedagogues and for many years they worked at the school. \r\n\r\nMnacakan has no higher education and for many years the only way of providing for his family financially was doing construction work abroad (in the Russian Federation). During the period that he worked abroad, the nice and rich orchard of apricot trees that his father had planted dried up since his parents were old and could not take care of it. \r\n\r\nSince now Mnacakan has his own family, he decided never to leave his village again and also to restore their beautiful orchard. He hopes that after two or three years, he will have the sweetest and the best harvest of apricots as it used to be when he was a little boy and his father took care of those trees. \r\n\r\nMnacakan requests a loan in an amount of 1,200 US dollars in order to start restoring his apricot orchard (to clean and to mold the soil, plant new tress, organize its watering system, etc.).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1609656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to restore his apricot orchard.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ararat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2014-05-25T14:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-24T14:40:09Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mnacakan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":94},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":101},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":102},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":193,"local_amount":193,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T16:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":193,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504373569},{"amount":94,"local_amount":94,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517719864},{"amount":95,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530122190},{"amount":818,"local_amount":818,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-22T09:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":818,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542631961}],"funded_date":"2014-06-01T04:33:17Z","paid_date":"2014-10-22T09:51:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":713554,"name":"Mao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a wooden house located in the Prasat Balang district of Kampong Thom province, Mao is a 30-year-old married woman with three children.

Isomiddin's wife Shohsanam helps with looking after the cattle. \r\n\r\nThanks to the livestock breeding, Isomiddin and his family's life has become better. Slowly, Isomiddin was able to purchase a plot of land in order to build a small house. He also married away his daughter. Isomiddin sold his cattle not long ago, and currently he would like to purchase not one but two heads of cattle and fodder. However he does not have enough money for purchasing the cattle. Therefore Isomiddin applied for a loan.

lives in the country. He is married and has three children. Rustam does seasonal agricultural work as a hired labourer and receives a small salary, but his primary source of income is fattening and reselling cattle. His wife is a homemaker who actively helps her husband around the household and takes care of the livestock. Rustam himself takes the cattle to the market and sells them, then uses the money he receives to buy young cattle and fatten them for further resale. He doesn't have enough education to get an adequate job. Like all rural residents, his financial situation is difficult, and he wants to increase his head count of livestock in order to increase his turnover.\r\n\r\nRustam says that he wants to take care of his family so that their needs are met and the children get a good education and become specialists in their fields. He has turned to Arvand for financial support in hope of achieving this. He wants to buy cattle and increase the number of livestock he has. He thanks organizations such as Arvand in advance for their help and support to poor people who have very little, as it is thanks to such organizations that people can improve their quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1604812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.
