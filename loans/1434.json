His wife stays at home doing the housework but she goes out to help him when she can.

The loan he is requesting is to buy manure, fertilizer, herbicide and seeds. He will have the opportunity to improve his quality of living. It is time to seed and with the rains already falling he says it is time to clear the fields. He is only waiting for the loan to be approved to buy the fertilizers he needs. He says that he will feel very content as this year he proposes to plant more as they have another mouth to feed. His dreams are that God gives him the time to continue to work his corn fields to earn the daily bread for his family.

She cooks some of the fish herself to sell to people on the street, and the rest she sells to small local restaurants. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Marie dreams of being able to build a home for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5350,"image":{"id":1604185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fresh fish from the river to sell as well as additional pots and pans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2014-05-26T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-25T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":5350,"lender_count":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"F\u00e9licit\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ev\u00e9line","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":2550000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":187100},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":191300},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195700},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200200},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":204900},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":209600},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":214400},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":219200},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":224300},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":229400},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":234900},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":239000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":429.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":439.75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.29},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":501.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":793.89,"local_amount":378400,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":380044.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504277867},{"amount":1260.51,"local_amount":600800,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":603410.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517560450},{"amount":889.57,"local_amount":424000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":425842.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530043252},{"amount":930.48,"local_amount":443500,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":445427.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542536073},{"amount":974.12,"local_amount":464300,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":466317.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561669178},{"amount":500.72,"local_amount":239000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":240038.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"payment_id":579588872}],"funded_date":"2014-06-03T20:40:18Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:41:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":713804,"name":"Freedom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These women are part of the group called Freedom and Gifty is the featured borrower of this group.

She lives in a rural area, and has been farming livestock since she was young.  She doesn't have any formal education, as she's had to work to support herself all her life.  Her husband earns some additional money for the family by working as a driver at night; during the day, he helps Sayora around the farm.  All the money he makes goes towards their living expenses, and as it's sometimes not enough to pay for everything, they depend on livestock as their main source of income.  Sayora takes care of their animals, while her husband buys and sells them.  They work day and night so that their son lacks for nothing, including education.  She is seeking a loan to add more cattle to her farm, and is very thankful for organizations like Arvand, which give people of modest means the opportunity to improve their quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1604111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

","en":"Soro, as a responsible woman, launched her business a few years ago in order to provide for her children. Soro processes and sells dried fruits.  She owns an apricot orchard. Every season Soro harvests apricots and also buys them from other farmers; then she processes, dries and sells the fruits at the local market. She has been in this business for several years and has her steady customer following. This season, Soro would like to increase her working capital and buy more apricots. The new season is about to start,  which is why she is applying for a loan of 6,000 TJS to buy boxes and other accessories for processing apricots.

daughter. She has been elected to be the team leader of Noong Luong 7 Group, which consists of seven Thai ladies. Her family's earnings mainly rely on agriculture activities, such as cultivating rice, growing bananas, raising chickens, ducks and fish. To have further income to cover better living expenses and pay tuition fees for their daughter, her husband works extra for local construction employers. \r\n\r\nHoa also wants to expand her business, so she has taken a loan from Anh Chi Em, and this time, she will use the loan to buy small fish. This is the third time Hoa has had a loan with Anh Chi Em. Recently, she has faced some difficulties, such as lacking money to buy food for fish or buy fertilizer for the rice field; supplies are high-priced while her products are low-priced.

Their parents are old and weak; their daughter attends kindergarten and their son is in grade 2. \r\n\r\nTo cover all living expenses, Anh's husband works for a local construction employer while she works in agriculture production and constantly expands her farming activities. Specifically, Anh raises fish, chicken, and pigs and cultivates rice and cassava. \r\n\r\nAnh said that she has benefited a lot since she joined the Anh Chi Em Program. Indeed, she has earned a high profit from using the loan from Anh Chi Em and has gained plenty of knowledge on agriculture and hygiene from the program's training. Hence, Anh decided to continue taking out loans from Anh Chi Em. This is her fourth loan, which she will use to buy piglets. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that her family's income will be improved significantly and her children will have a better education and a better future than she has. \r\n\r\nIn the picture, Anh is holding a paper and stands on the

She is married and has ten children, four of whom are daughters (two of them are already married). With her loan she will buy peanuts to process them into oil and \"rakal\" [animal fodder]. She will buy peanuts at 500 West African francs per kg [2.2 lbs] in Ndangalma, a village hosting a weekly market, or in Bambey S\u00e9reres. She owns equipment for processing peanuts and obtains 80 liters [21 gal] of oil and 45 kg [99 lbs] of \"rakal\" from 200 kg [440 lbs] of peanuts. She resells oil for 1,000 francs per liter and rakal for 350 francs per kg. The revenues from her business will allow her to grow her savings, pay off her interest and improve the life conditions of her family by buying clothing for her children and grandchildren, as well as

Department of Solol\u00e1 . Seven women have gathered together and have formed a new Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cMujeres Central La Cuchilla\u201d. The ladies are quite excited to take out their very first loan. They will use the funds in their small businesses, which include the sale of flowers and vegetables, items for daily consumption and the sale of gifts. Others work in agricultural endeavors. \r\n\r\nMaria is a 26-year-old member of the Trust Bank and has had two years of education. She is single and works with her brother in their new small store with the goal of laying the foundation for a more successful and prosperous future. In the store, Maria offers various gifts and other curios. Maria is requesting a loan that she will use to expand her inventory and offer her customers balls, toys, plates, glasses and other kitchen items, cleaning supplies as well as certain items of clothing including socks. She is pleased that her business generates satisfactory income but sees possibilities for expanding it as the demand for items in the store is increasing. Besides working with her brother in the business, she has employed an additional helper to attend to her customers. Maria is happy and enthusiastic about the possibilities of additional capital to invest in her expanding business.\r\n\r\nBesides obtaining a small loan from Friendship Bridge, clients benefit from the monthly non-formal educational trainings that are presented by a Loan Officer of the organization. The ladies are hungry to acquire new knowledge about healthy meals, medicinal plants and hygiene, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, as well as self-esteem. They are greatly aided by information about effective business practices including accounting, budgeting and customer service. It is this educational component combined with small loans that comprises the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge. The ladies, their families and their community benefit.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly impossible for an impoverished woman in Guatemala to walk into a bank and take out a loan. Kiva  investors, with their generous loans, are so greatly valued and appreciated by  over 20,000 clients of Friendship Bridge. Thank you!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":1610282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In order to earn money to support her family, Sareoun has been farming for ages. In addition to that, she also struggles to earn some money from a fishery. These jobs provide Sareoun\u2019s family an average of 10,200 KHR daily which is barely enough to cover basic expenses of the family.  \r\n\r\nSareoun has been a borrower of Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund for two cycles already.

At this time it was difficult to study so she decided to postpone her studies. She has three children but she never got married. The son that lives with her is studying and she pays for those costs. No one else lives with them. <br \/><br \/>Her business is selling chickens ready to be cooked. She buys them when they are small, one day after birth, takes care of them and fattens them. Later she sells them, cleaned and ready to be cooked. The need to have income for her household motivated her to work with these small animals and today she has a large clientele. For any type of event that takes place she is the one to order chickens from. She has no other commercial activity. <br \/><br \/>Her farm is at her house and she sells about 100 chickens per month.

She also looks after a grandson whose parents went to live abroad in search of a better future.\r\n\r\nShe makes a living selling quesadillas, cassava and pastries etc. Since her husband died she has had to work hard to find income for the household, even though she gets sent payments. She is not someone who will just sit back and wait for money to arrive. She does not have any other jobs. She makes her sales from her home, but when she does not sell as much as she had hoped, she goes out selling from door to door. She walks about 2 km doing this. She works every day, selling quesadillas in the morning and the other items in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for the loan to buy sand, cement and iron to improve the passageway in her home.

He and his family live in a rural village where they grow crops such as onions for a living.  After gathering his harvest, he takes it to a big bazaar and sells it there.  Previously, he was a dekhan farmer and decided later to sell his own harvest instead.  To earn additional money on the side, he raises cattle for resale.  Currently, Utkirjon is seeking to grow more crops, but lacks the money to do so; as such, he's turned to Arvand for a loan to buy seeds for sowing.

In addition to getting good-quality pigs that can become fat and of good quality in the short term, with this purchase, he could develop the activity and also have some savings that will allow him to have more animals and invest more in the project at the same time as providing more income for his family.

She previously accessed a 12,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and in their personal, household and business expenditures.<br \/><br \/>Evangeline owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg and others. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price and then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby and the people in the community. She earns PHP 300 a day.<br \/><br \/>To be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting another PHP 10,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.<br \/><br \/>Evangeline hopes for her business to earn more profit and she desires to be successful someday.

and hardworking 56 year old man. He is married and has two children. He came to Arvand initially when he found out about the possibility of receiving financial support. Ravshan himself lives with his family in a rural area. He doesn't have a higher education because the family's difficult financial situation kept him from being able to attend a university. Ravshan's wife doesn't have a higher education either. As a housewife she takes care of the house and raises the children. \r\n\r\nTo earn a living Ravshan runs his own business feeding and selling cattle. He also works on the side as a contractor. He earns a good income from his business. His wife helps with the work. She sells milk from the cows. Now Ravshan wants to expand his herd and his business.

He has two children. He came to Arvand when he found out about the possibility of receiving financial support. Anorboy lives with his family in a rural area. He does not have a higher education because his family's financial difficulties made it impossible for him to attend university. Anorboy's wife doesn't have a higher education either, and takes care of the house and children as a housewife. To earn an income Anorboy runs his own business feeding and selling cattle.

is an optimistic and hardworking 34 year old woman. She is married and has four children. She lives in a small rural town. Since childhood Dilovar dreamed of becoming an educated woman, earning a higher education and having a good job. But her life didn't turn out that way; her family's financial hardships kept her from being able to attend a university. She married immediately after finishing high school, and thus became a housewife. But even being at home all the time she is never idle. Dilovar and her husband do everything to provide their children with what they need. In order to earn a stable income, Dilovar and her husband started their own business, practicing animal husbandry. Dilovar raises the animals and then sells their meat and milk. She receives a good income from the business. Dilovar's husband also works in a local workshop and earns additional income for the family. Their incomes together are enough to support the family at an average level, but they still don't have enough resources to cover all needs. Currently Dilovar and her husband want to buy a few more cattle for feeding. To do this she came to Arvand, wanting a loan for purchase of the animals. Dilovar thanks Arvand in advance for the support, which will lead to improvements in her family's quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1591942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-26T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-25T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilovar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":327.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":351.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":354.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":364.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":381.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":390.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":405.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":425.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.13,"local_amount":327.03,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":334.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562220},{"amount":73.31,"local_amount":351.91,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":359.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694908},{"amount":73.94,"local_amount":354.89,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":362.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626689},{"amount":75.88,"local_amount":364.2,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":372.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209174},{"amount":333.74,"local_amount":1601.97,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1637.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752149}],"funded_date":"2014-06-18T15:22:00Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":711174,"name":"Lorenzo Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lorenzo de 30 a\u00f1os de edad es una persona muy trabajadora y responsable quien vive junto a sus dos hijos y su esposa.

and hardworking 65 year old man. He is married and has three children. He first contacted Arvand when he learned of the possibility of receiving financial assistance. Jabar lives with his family in a rural area. He doesn't have a higher education because his family's financial difficulties kept him from being able to attend university. Jabar's wife, Latofat also lacks a higher education, and is a housewife. She takes care of the house and raises the children. To earn a living Jabar runs his own business raising and selling cattle. His work earns him a good income and allows him to provide for the family's needs. His wife also helps with the work: she sells milk from the cows. Now Jabar wants to expand the herd and his business. To do this he came to Arvand for a loan to buy cattle. He hopes for a good result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support.

She is the featured profile member pictured with her hand raised. She lives with her family of seven, including her husband, three sons and two daughters. She is very energetic, hardworking and enthusiastic and always devotes her time to get her family ahead. \r\n\r\nPhalkhohat has been doing a tea stall business with her husband in the village for the last five years to maintain her family. Initially, with the first loan from Kiva, she started a low-budget tea stall business in her house. She gained a little profit and with the second loan, she moved the tea stall to a nearby roadside where more people could reach easily.

lives in Coron, Palawan, Philippines. Coron was one of the affected areas when typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines last November, 2013. She is 33 years old and she is married to Eugenio, who works as a driver. They have one child who is not yet attending school. Few months after the typhoon, Marjorie\u2019s business is recovering and she continues to work so her business will expand and grow. \r\n\r\nMarjorie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 23,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMarjorie dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her family will have a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1610560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The group members run small businesses selling cosmetic products (ointments, hair extensions...), breads, clothing, and prepared foods. With the goal of resupplying for cash, the group members decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their third group loan cycle. Ms. Sadio (the woman seated third from the right to the left in the photo) has a great reputation in the sale of the finest-quality cosmetics products. She expects to use her loan to buy 30 packs of hair extensions and 4 boxes of ointments at wholesale at the large market. The resale of the products takes place at retail in Kalaban-Coura to a clientele mostly composed of women. Ms. Sadio hopes to make an average monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA with this loan, which will be used to reinvest in her business.
