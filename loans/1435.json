His daily schedule is from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m.  His wife and children help him when they can.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from Credicampo is to buy fertilizer for his cultivated fields, as well as other supplies that he uses on them.

With this loan he thinks he will cover the expenses that are coming up soon, for winter has already started and that is when he needs to prepare the land for sowing.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to always have good health so that he can keep on farming for his family.

Lhingkhoneng lives in a village in Manipur, in the northeastern state of India, with her brothers and sisters. Her parents died when she was very young. Her elder brothers and sisters got married so the responsibility to look after her younger siblings rests entirely upon her. \r\n\r\nInitially, she did not have any source of income to manage the family. The only source to sustain the family was her father\u2019s pension. She used the money to manage the family and for her younger brother\u2019s education. To generate more income she engaged herself in doing quarry work near the river bank and earned daily wages. Unfortunately, the hard manual work took its toll on her health and she was forced to stop physical work on the doctor\u2019s advice.\r\n\r\nAs she wanted to start her own income-generating business and needed financial assistant, she inquired among a few of her friends who are members of Kiva and they informed her that a loan could be accessed from WSDS, a partner with Kiva. She was delighted to know that there are generous people who could help her. With the first Kiva loan, she set up a small variety store near her house and in second and third loans she expanded and filled in more expensive items like sugar, rice, lentils etc in the store. Now, her store also deals in selling mobile recharge cards,  too.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of saving money enthused her and she started saving some amount daily. Thus the money she saved was used in repaying the loan amount, bought two calves, a refrigerator and a computer.\r\n\r\nLhingkhoneng is very happy that she could help in maintaining the family in some ways and in repaying the loan without any default or even much difficulty. She said, \u201cI am so happy and satisfied with WSDS\/Kiva as it helped me in changing my life and my family's. Previously I had to do manual labor for income-generating but now, I am settled in my business. I will try to access loans in future as well and try to help others in changing their lives as much as I can.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike her the rest of the group members are engaged in ginger farming and variety stores. \r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1610592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy items like mobile recharge cards, rice, sugar, lentils, etc. and sell them for more profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-05-27T13:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-26T13:30:16Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneivah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingvei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneilhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingnei ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":190000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":190000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T12:46:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":710798,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":233.51,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to re-stock her business with 500 layers.

good-natured and very hard-working man. He is married and has two children. Bahrom lives with his wife and children in a small house in a rural village. Despite his age he is full of strength and the desire to work to help his family. Bahrom works doing farming and rearing animals. He has a plot of land of around 12 hectares. 8 hectares of that land is rainfed and the rest is irrigated. Bahrom grows carrots, potatoes and grain on this land. His wife helps him care for and rear the cattle. Since their land is big, they also graze their cattle on it.\r\n\r\nThe animal rearing business brings a good income and for that reason Bahrom wants to grow the business, increasing the quantity of his cattle. But now he needs to buy food to stockpile for his cattle but he does not have enough funds. Therefore he turned to Arvand, to receive a loan to buy food for his cattle. Bahrom thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

She is a mother to her two children, and all by herself she manages their household while operating her business. She is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.<br \/><br \/>Lolita owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business.* She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. The income she gets from this is called boundary (daily quota).** The regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.<br \/><br \/>To help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income, as she expands her business.<br \/><br \/>Lolita dreams of having another jeepney unit and hopes to have a better living. She meets up with her co-fellowship members*** every week, to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/><br \/>*Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.<br \/><br \/>**In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. Essentially, the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the boundary payment, minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.<br \/><br \/>***All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Before the loan, she only had one pig and now, because of the loan, she has four piglets and one sow. The sow gave birth to nine healthy piglets. She sold the piglets after two months to pay off the loan. She also set aside savings and fulfilled her family's daily needs. All the member of Sari Karya feel the benefits from this business. They can support their husbands' incomes. The group expects another training from MUK for better knowledge of pig breeding.\n\nAfter the success with her sows, Ni Ketut continue her business as a piglets seller. Her piglets have good quality because she keeps them well and gives them nutritious feeds and vitamin. She also became an example to other breeders, not only in her group, but also in her village.\n  \nWith same loan size, she will use her loan to purchase superior quality feed and renovate the cage. Now Ni Ketut and the Sari Karya group hope that they can be independent in terms of capital. She hopes her plan can run smoothly.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1603815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

One of them is Minati, who was selected as their president. The lady standing with her  hand raised is Minati.\r\n\r\nMinati got the idea of doing paddy and vegetable cultivation from People's Forum, so she gathered some other women from her neighbourhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. Initially, she started with growing only few vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, and onions but later on she grew bitter gourds, snake gourds, cucumbers, lady fingers (okra) and brinjals (eggplants). She has very good relationships with her customers as she sells fresh vegetables to them. Now she has a new idea to rent some more land for cultivation so that she can grow more vegetables on a large scale and do paddy cultivation also.

Although, she is always at home, Sokina never sits without doing anything. She tries to do everything possible to provide herself and her parents with all of the necessities.\r\n\r\nSokina started her own business in order to have a regular income for food. She is involved in animal husbandry. Sokina raises livestock and then sells meat and milk. She earns a good income from this business. Sokina's parents also help her with the business, and for now they do not have enough money to cover all of the existing needs. At the present time, Sokina wants to buy several more heads of livestock for fattening up. This is why she came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock. Sokina thanks Arvand in advance for the support, which would result in an improvement in her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1591273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-27T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-26T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":300.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":325.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":328.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":338.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":355.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":364.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":380.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":405.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.73},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.73,"local_amount":300.59,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":302.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562218},{"amount":513.27,"local_amount":2499.41,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694905}],"funded_date":"2014-06-17T14:41:50Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":707442,"name":"Abesigamukama Farmers Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nMable previously used her Kiva loan to buy more chairs that she rents to the public for functions, being a festive season in which there were many activities.

He acquired a YOUTH loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner Al Majmoua in order to increase his merchandise, which promises progress in new extra income. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he intends to explore a certain piece of land to enlarge his market in more scrap and pre-used electronics.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1610766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":["Youth","Arab Youth"],"use":"to increase his merchandise, which promises progress with new extra income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Qana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2014-05-27T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-26T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Refugee"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mouhamad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504160596},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517444298},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529928240},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542420628},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561558299},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579467275},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595074050},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T10:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610476597},{"amount":332,"local_amount":332,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":332,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624151127}],"funded_date":"2014-06-23T01:01:56Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T10:25:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":707624,"name":"Daysi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

years. She is married and has three children. She lives in a small village. Since childhood, Shoira dreamed of becoming a teacher, however circumstances were such that she was not able to get higher education due to the family's insufficient finances. \r\n\r\nRight after finishing secondary school, Shoira got married and became a housewife. Together with her husband she tries to do everything possible in order to provide their children with all necessary things. To have a stable income for food, Shoira and her husband started a business. They work with agriculture and livestock breeding. Shoira breeds cattle, and then she sells the milk and meat from it. She gets a good income from this business. \r\n\r\nShoira's husband also works as a local master carpenter, and his work brings the family an additional income. Their combined income is sufficient for living at a middle-class level. Still, they don't have sufficient funds to cover all their needs. \r\n\r\nCurrently Shoira and her husband would like to purchase some additional heads of cattle for breeding. Therefore, she turned to Arvand and would like to take a loan to purchase cattle. Shoira thanks Arvand in advance for the support, due to which the family's life quality will improve."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1591260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-27T19:50:51Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-26T19:50:51Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":42.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shoira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":701.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":758.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":765.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":787.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":826.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":846.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":881.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":932.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.05,"local_amount":701.76,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":701.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562219},{"amount":154.71,"local_amount":758.96,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":759.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694906},{"amount":156.08,"local_amount":765.68,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":765.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626687},{"amount":160.43,"local_amount":787.03,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":787.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209172},{"amount":168.4,"local_amount":826.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":826.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752147},{"amount":168.53,"local_amount":846.55,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":846.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.04,"payment_id":624277404},{"amount":330.88,"local_amount":1813.9,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1814.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.88,"payment_id":636634827}],"funded_date":"2014-06-25T16:04:05Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":714540,"name":"Nahid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nahid has expertise in hand embroidery.

To help her to continue her operations, she has requested a loan of PKR 40,000 to buy reels of thread in different colors and packs of beads, sequins and stones for embellishment. In this way she would be able to cater to more customers consistently. She is hopeful to get an increase in her income by targeting more customers. She is in her seventh loan cycle with a good credit

They guide and help one another to empower themselves in their businesses and help improve their lives. \r\n\r\nLhaineilhing is the featured member, pictured with her hand raised. She is 36 years old, a mother to three daughters and two sons. Her two older kids are in pre-secondary and three younger kids are in primary and intermediate grade. Her husband is a carpenter by profession; he makes furniture such as beds, chairs, shelves, tables and wardrobes, etc. per customer\u2019s order. \r\n\r\nIn order to construct the furniture her husband requires materials such as planks, nails, paint and good tools. Therefore, Lhaineilhing wanted to access a loan to invest money to buy all the required materials for the carpentry work. The family\u2019s income relies on this business as this is one of the main income-generating sources and failing to complete the customer\u2019s order on time means the income of the family is scant, too. \r\n\r\nWith the little extra savings she has after managing the household and children\u2019s expenditures, and in order to supplement the income of the family, Lhaineilhing buys meat from the butcher and sells it for a profit in the market. From the little profit she gets she will repay the loan, says Lhaineilhing. She wishes to access another loan to start a piggery farm as this business could generate lots of income. Likewise, the rest of the group members also need loans for their respective income-generating activities. Piggery farming, vegetable vending, and grocery store are some of the activities of the group.

and hardworking woman of the age of 54. She is a widow and has two children who depend on her. She turned to Arvand for the first time not long ago, as she learnt that it was possible to get financial support. \r\n\r\nHaticha lives with her family in a village. She does not have higher education, as it was not possible for her to study at the university due to her family's financial difficulties. However, since her young years, she learnt needlework and sewing from her mother. Currently this knowledge helps her to survive. To have a normal income for food, Haticha has her own business. She is a seamstress. She sews women's clothing on order. Haticha also earns money sewing kurpachas (traditional blankets) and pillows on order for wedding events. She gets a good income from this business. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Haticha would like to purchase a more modern sewing machine, which will work better, of higher quality and also produce better goods. She also needs to purchase a few rolls of fabric. Therefore she turned to Arvand and would like to receive a loan to purchase the sewing machine to expand her business. Haticha hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1606849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vahdat","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-05-27T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-26T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haticha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":141.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":143.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":144.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":157.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":161.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":170.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":179.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":185.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":190},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":204.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.03,"local_amount":141.33,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":147.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302959},{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":143.71,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":149.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585757},{"amount":30.74,"local_amount":144.65,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":150.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081341},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":152.91,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":159.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562222},{"amount":33.53,"local_amount":157.78,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":164.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694910},{"amount":34.31,"local_amount":161.48,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":168.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626691},{"amount":35.69,"local_amount":167.97,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":175.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209176},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":170.36,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":177.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752151},{"amount":37.27,"local_amount":179.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":187.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.89,"payment_id":624277407},{"amount":35.32,"local_amount":185.72,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":193.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.15,"payment_id":636634829},{"amount":71.98,"local_amount":394.52,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":411.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.86,"payment_id":649616168}],"funded_date":"2014-05-30T18:29:36Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":714550,"name":"Aneela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aneela is a 25-year-old married woman.

He started this business not long ago and tries to develop it gradually. He has his own stall where he sells spare parts and accessories for mobile phones. He gets a good income form this business. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Firuzjon would like to expand his business. He needs to purchase some spare parts for mobile phones, but does not have sufficient funds. Therefore he turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase spare parts and accessories for mobile phones. Firuzjon hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the

She also sells milk to generate an extra amount of income. \r\n\r\nIjaz needs to improve her business to bear her household expenses. For this reason, she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of PKR 40,000 to purchase more animals. She is very experienced and has good contacts in the market. With this loan, she will definitely expand her business and income level. She is in her fourth loan cycle, with good credit history. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1610462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more animals.

","en":"During the warm time of year the work doubles for farmers and farm workers, especially those involved in planting agricultural crops. Uktam also works on a field. He is a very hardworking and kind person. He is 48 years old, married. His wife, Sharabniso, works as a farmer in a rural area. They have a very friendly family. They always support each other in everything, especially in hard times. Uktam plants various types of agricultural crops every spring. He does not just plant them in the field, but also at home. He has a large plot of land. Uktam's entire family business consists of growing agricultural crops, with which he provides for and supports his family. He planted various types of agricultural crops with the onset of the season. As we can see on the photograph, the first seedling have already started sprouting, which makes Uktam happy. He gets inspired by his work and handles the planted crops with a lot of love and care. But for better harvest and empty space, he needs financial means for fertilizers and purchase of seeds. This is why Uktam came to Arvand for a loan. Uktam expresses his gratitude in advance for the support and timely service of the organization staff."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1605552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Due to the financial situation of his family it was impossible to continue his studies. He is in a common-law relationship and his wife works as domestic labor, taking care of children. They are parents to a daughter who does not yet go to school. His parents,  two siblings, his wife and daughter all live with him. His wife and daughter are dependent on him.<br \/><br \/>A few months ago Andr\u00e9s joined the armed forces. It's been about 4 months since he joined. It was something he wanted to do since he was small. He also gets remittances from family members. He worked as a laborer in a metal fabrication company where they made doors, windows and roofs. The place where he worked was 25 km from his house and he traveled there by bus. He worked from 6 in the morning until 4 pm and then rested. <br \/><br \/>Andr\u00e9s will use the loan to pay off a debt he has and with the rest he will buy part of the material he needs to finish the room he is building.

Through a lot of sacrifice, he studied through the fifth grade. He is married and has three children. His wife is a homemaker.\r\n\r\nHe is a farmer. He has been working in this for more than 30 years. From the time he was very young, his father taught him to work and be responsible. He also raises cattle. He has three cows that he milks and a pair of oxen that he uses for his work. The distance he has to go is variable because he works two parcels of land and he doesn\u2019t always go to the same place. When he harvests his crop, he sells part of it and keeps the rest for his own consumption. No helps him with his work. He works from 6:00am until 12:00 noon. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in buying agricultural inputs (fertilizers, herbicides). An improvement would be to have his own working capital. \r\n\r\nHis dearest dream is to be able to continue working, as long as his health allows. He hopes that his children, like himself, will be successful people. With the earnings that his work produces, a percentage will be for paying the loan and the rest will be for investing in his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1606319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs (fertilizers, herbicides).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-28T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-27T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Salom\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":307.31,"local_amount":307.31,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":307.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201906},{"amount":342.69,"local_amount":342.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":342.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650535998}],"funded_date":"2014-06-25T17:58:30Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":714642,"name":"Victo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victo lives in Kampala with her husband and two children, both of whom attend school.

through sixth grade. He is married and his wife takes care of the work at home and of their children.  Their two children go to school; no one else lives with them so their income is only for the use of the family.\r\n\r\nHe is a bricklayer and a farmer, and is a fighting person who wants to get ahead in life.  Jose learned to work as a bricklayer by  paying attention to the work when he was an assistant at construction jobs.  He is also a farmer; when he was small his father taught him to farm  land and benefit from it.    He has no other occupations.  The distance he travels varies, since it depends on where the work is.  Today he is working in the town where he lives and can make the trip to the work site by bicycle.
