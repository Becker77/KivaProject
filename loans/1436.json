Four years of careful training had not been undertaken for common standards. Also, my background knowledge of woodwork helped me.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Bernadette is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products such as shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. \r\n\r\nBernadette dreams of expanding her business and hopes to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week where she can draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

As for many rural dwellers, the main source of income for his family is raising livestock and growing farm produce. He is married and has four adult children, in whom he instilled work values from their youth. His family is very hard-working. The older children are now in Russia as migrant workers and help out the family financially. Narzullo was able to bring up four wonderful children thanks to his income from working a small land plot and raising livestock for meat. However, as his children grow, his living quarters need to be expanded as well. This is why Narzullo keeps working tirelessly.

to study. He is in a relationship and his partner is a housewife. They have six children, one of whom is in school. Miguel has made a living from farming for 15 years. He learned the trade from his father who would take him to the maize field to assist him in his spare time, where he learned about farming work at the same time. The children help out with planting, and even help when the maize is ready to be harvested. He works rotating shifts, sometimes from 6am to 12 noon. The loan he is requesting will be invested in a bag of fertiliser, maize seed, beans and other fertilisers that are needed for planting and for monitoring the maize field. He feels that things are going to improve as he has thought about planting 2.6 acres of maize and beans. His dreams, wishes and hopes are that God will give him good health and support his children in their studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1606332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

","en":"Sharofat is 54, married and has two children.  Her husband has left for Russia to find work and send money back home to help feed the family.  Sharofat has a number of good traits, such as an inability to idle the day away.  She works just as hard as her husband does to earn a living, toiling in the fields and taking care of the livestock on her farm.  Sharofat's children are still in grade school; she wants them to have a better quality of life than they have now, and hopes they'll be able to get a good education.  She sets aside what money she can from selling produce and milk for her children's future.  She is counting on a large harvest this year, which will help her improve her family's living conditions.  With this in mind, she's seeking a loan from Arvand to buy mineral fertilizers and seeds.  Sharofat hopes that the people at Arvand will hear her out and grant her the help she needs.

The group paid off the loan on time. With seven members, one member had enough saving and used her capital to continue the business by herself. The group decided to borrow a new loan to increase the business.\n\nNi Wayan, as the head of the group, sold her three pigs for 3.500.000 IDR and still has one left to sell later. After deducting all the costs, she earned a profit of 1,000,000 IDR. She feels so happy because all of her hard work after five months of maintaining the pigs earned results.\n\nShe used the profit she earned for her daily needs and saved for her family's future needs.\n\nThe Taman Indah group received their new loan of 9,600,000 IDR. Each member received 1,400,000 IDR. This loan was used to purchase superior piglets and feed. With her loan, Ni Wayan purchased two superior piglets for fattening and used the rest to purchase feed. To reduce the costs, Ni Wayan combines a mixture of feed. She hopes that in the next five months, the progress for pig growth will be fast and she can sell at a high price. Her husband helps her in the business by finding a traditional feed such as banana leaves from his garden. With this business, she hopes she can save and renovate her kitchen.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1611406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase two superior piglets and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-05-28T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-27T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.12,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"I Putu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"I Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Dayu Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Umi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":847.88,"local_amount":9600000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9778910,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.12,"payment_id":579615576}],"funded_date":"2014-05-29T13:23:41Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T13:13:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":714964,"name":"Naroeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naroeun is a 34-year-old married woman and a loving mother of five children.

She used the previous loans which she has paid back successfully, to buy more fruit and vegetables. Marry manages to resell her business stock safely and she believe that with this business, she will have a place to sleep (nice house) and greatly improve her life. She used the returns from the business to buy a plot of land where she started building. Marry covered also school fees and home food expenses. She will use this loan to buy stock for her genge (a grocery stall).  \r\n\r\nMarry will share this loan with her loan group \u201dPrado\u201d which totals two members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

They have three children, but only two of them live with the parents and they go to school.\r\n\r\nMiguel is a farmer, he learnt this from his father when he was very small. He did not study a lot and put all his efforts into his work, therefore he does not have any other source of income. His work is seasonal, because on his land he has planted sugar-apple trees and during the season he sells the fruits in the neighboring municipalities.

Her cafe is the only business Monika is depending on to meet her family's needs. Her project was planned to be restaurant, but it failed to reach the expected target. Later, she replaced it with a cafe, selling fresh milk, juices, sodas and tea with snacks. She believes that, with loan support from Kiva, her business will grow with enough capital to serve more customers. She starts her business from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily and is able to make a fair profit each month. \r\n\r\nMonika is requesting a second loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loan (which she repaid back successfully) to grow her business with more new stocks (bought take-away soft drinks), and bought a gas stove and flasks for keeping tea and milk. She managed to make a profit, which she used to pay school fees and home food expenses. \r\n\r\nMonika will use this loan to grow her service; buy water, soft drinks and packet milk; and pay for electrical and rent charges.

In spring and summer these hardworking women joined hands to support themselves through loan facilities. They belong to a Kuki tribal community in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. It is about a 40 km drive from the main city of Imphal. \r\n\r\nChinneithem is the featured member pictured with raised hand. She is 40 years old and a mother to two sons and a daughter. Her husband is a cultivator by profession. Her older son is in pre-secondary and the younger son and daughter are in high school.\r\n \r\nPrior to shifting to the present village, Chinneithem and her family lived in an interior and remote village. Unfortunately, one day her younger son fell seriously ill and since the village lacked medical facilities and easy means of transportation, they were forced to leave the village to find better amenities for their survival in a new village that is nearer to the main town of Imphal. \r\n\r\nSince there is no other source to generate income in the family apart from the paddy field, in order to supplement the family income Chinneithem started a business using her weaving expertise. She weaves three to four wrap-around skirts every month and sells them for 2,500 to 3,000 INR. With the first loan of 5,000 INR, she bought the required materials like yarn and weaving tools to start the business and she used the little amount left for her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nLike every mother, her dream is to give a good education to her children so they can get decent careers. Chinneithem is very happy and content because her effort is not being wasted. Her children are very brilliant and studious; they are her hope and therefore she gives her best effort raising them to become somebody in the future. \r\n\r\nNow, Chinneithem needs another loan to continue her weaving activities. She will use the loan to buy more yarns of different qualities and colors to increase the production of traditional wrap-around skirts for her business. Likewise, the rest of the group members needed the loan to upgrade their respective business undertakings. Weaving, vegetable vending and tea stall are the primary activities of the group members.         \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1611548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy yarns of varied colors and texture to weave traditional garments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-05-28T14:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-27T14:20:18Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenghoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengboi Thangkhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongpi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahneilenn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":145000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-05-29T14:16:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":715115,"name":"Naseem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naseem is a 42-year-old married woman.

This is 41-year-old Greatmore from Harare. She is married with four children, three of whom attend school. For the past year, Greatmore has run a business where she produces clothes. Her main business challenge is frequent power cuts and she ends up using alternatives such as generators which lead to increased cost of production. \r\n\r\nGreatmore is requesting a 500 USD loan to buy fabric for sewing skirts. She says the extra income generated as a result of her loan will allow her to increase output which, in turn, will increase her profits. In the future, Greatmore plans to own a factory with all the necessary equipment for a tailoring business.

He has a higher education, his own profitable business, and a loving family - a wife and three children. He and his wife have been selling sausage and cheese products wholesale for 10 years. They have a shop in the city's main market from which they sell sausage and cheese that they have bought in large quantities to smaller retailers. Murodjon is a goal-oriented man. He doesn't want his business to stagnate, so he is planning how to further develop it. In order to achieve his plans, he needs a large sum of money. He is preparing to bring in more goods and in order to store them, he needs two more large glass-front refrigerators, which are very expensive. Therefore he is requesting a loan in order to buy them for $2,500 dollars each. This loan is very important to him and he hopes for the support of lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1609284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is very happy to have the opportunity to expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbdurahim's wife and children help him with tasks around the property, but he can't have his children taking care of him entirely, so he himself helps by looking after his growing grandchildren. He is a hardworking, positive man who loves his family very much. After a long, hard winter he has run out of stores of animal feed and with the onset of spring he needs to acquire enough feed for his livestock, since keeping cattle and processing their milk is his primary source of income and he wouldn't want to sell them just because he didn't have enough feed, and in such a way lose his means of earning a living. In order to buy enough feed for his cattle, Abdurahim needs a loan, for which he has turned to Arvand.

She is a young 23-year-old single mother of a five-year-old child who is her motivation to succeed on a daily basis. Because she became a teenage mother, Aura was unable to finish school but realized how important education was to a successful life. With the help of her parents and double effort on her part, she continued her studies and now she has a Certificate in Accounting from high school\r\n\r\nShe began to sell fruit in a nearby park to earn a living and the business is coming along well. Aura is requesting a loan in order to purchase more fruit to meet the increasing demand for it. With a proud voice, she reports that she feels happy alongside her son who is enrolled in school. She wants to provide everything that he needs and she realizes that she has many opportunities to take advantage of.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cMargaritas\u201d Trust Bank are very thankful to obtain their small loans funded by KIVA investors. They learn a great deal from the monthly educational talks given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer on useful and relevant subjects like effective business practices, indebtedness, accounting and budgeting. They also are pleased to learn about women\u2019s rights and self esteem as well as nutrition, health and medicinal plants.

","en":"Idigul is a young 24-year-old widow. It has already been a year since she lost her husband. Her support in this life are her two adorable daughters, ages 3 and 6. \r\n\r\nIdigul educates and provides for them herself. Thanks to her mother, Idigul started to sew in her youth and has already worked as a professional seamstress for two years. \r\n\r\nInitially it was very difficult for Idigul to reconcile with the loss of her beloved husband.

her conservative community whose restrictions limited her to fields of business traditionally designated for women. Raghad faced the same challenges when she accompanied her husband to work in Libya. But, Raghad\u2019s dynamic personality and eagerness to work helped her rise above these challenges. She taught in kindergartens for five years while she lived in Libya which equipped her with valuable experience and skills.\n\nBuilding upon her experience and entrepreneurial spirit, Raghad opened a private kindergarten three years ago with very little money and support from her husband. Today, her successful business of six classes employs 12 women and generates enough income to support her family and improve their living conditions.\n\nHer growing business and willingness to learn and develop her business skills qualifies her to participate in the WLIFT program and take a SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of 10,000 USD. Raghad is responding to her clients\u2019 demand and increasing the number of classes; therefore, she plans to completely renovate her kindergarten by building a  second floor and adding a play and exercises hall, thus creating job opportunities for members of her community and extra income to support her family.\n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for her protection.

Group, which consists of eight Thai ladies. Xuan lives with her husband and her two children in an old Thai traditional house in a small village far from the city center. Her son is 21 years old and is learning to become a car driver while her daughter is 14 years old and is attending very fully secondary school with good study results. <br \/><br \/>To provide favorable conditions for the children, Xuan has worked very hard in various business and production activities. Indeed, she not only works at agriculture, such as raising chickens, ducks and planting vegetables, but also is dynamic at doing business. Specifically, she is a trader of aquatic products (fish, eel, shrimp, crab, etc.), which helps her a lot in improving her family's income. Together with her in the effort of earning a living, her husband works extra for the local construction employer. Their achievements meet their expectations and endeavors and currently, they can afford to pay completely the tuition fee for their two children as well as buy some furniture for the old house. <br \/><br \/>Xuan is very grateful to Anh Chi Em because of the support that the program has offered her family since she took out the first loan from here. This is her sixth loan with Anh Chi Em and this time she will use a portion of the loan to buy more aquatic products to sell in the city market.

He asks for a loan in order to buy merchandise (basins, pails, plastic plates, etc.) and vegetables (onions, tomatoes, sweet chilis, cabbages, etc.). This is his second loan and he is asking for 5,000 lempiras. Ismael is a very humble person who struggles to improve his standard of living. He used his income and part of his previous loan to improve his house, installing a sink, a toilet, and building walls. His dream is to have a house made of solid materials where he would be able to live decently with his family. \nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - March 2014"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1591671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise and food to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2014-05-28T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-27T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.76,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1313.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504388522},{"amount":34.3,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":656.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":517665517},{"amount":34.14,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":656.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"payment_id":530167267},{"amount":67.97,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1313.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":542646693},{"amount":34.24,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":656.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.12,"payment_id":579738573},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":656.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595306440}],"funded_date":"2014-05-31T14:12:36Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T15:08:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":715499,"name":"Godfrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Godfrey is a sixty-two year old married male with six children of which four attend school.

She needed to help her mother and her grandmother with the business.  It is now a family business where her sister also contributes by selling the product at her house and in an itinerant manner in nearby places.\n\nBecause they do not have other income, they need a loan to buy dough, plastic, charcoal, and other products wholesale in order to get a better price.  This will allow her to increase her production, to extend her business to a place with a greater flow of customers, and to continue growing.  She will do this in order to save and to improve her house as they have always dreamed of doing.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1606760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy dough, plastic, charcoal, and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Matagalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-05-28T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-27T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geraldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":268,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":29.78,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":30.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504303742},{"amount":31.17,"local_amount":30.38,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":31.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517586565},{"amount":29.95,"local_amount":29.18,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":29.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530082117},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":29.78,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542563016},{"amount":31.69,"local_amount":30.88,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":31.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695649},{"amount":60.07,"local_amount":58.54,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":60.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209846},{"amount":33.14,"local_amount":32.3,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":33.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610605099},{"amount":4.5,"local_amount":4.39,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624461655},{"amount":23.36,"local_amount":22.77,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":23.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636864971}],"funded_date":"2014-05-29T02:59:36Z","paid_date":"2015-04-19T11:21:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":711521,"name":"Las Amapolas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Las Amapolas forma parte del programa de eliminaci\u00f3n de la pobreza y tambi\u00e9n del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres de la fundaci\u00f3n paraguaya, est\u00e1n en su sexto ciclo, y demuestran que tienen muchas ganas de poder crecer, superarse y salir adelante.\nVioleta es una miembro ejemplo, ella se dedica a la venta de edredones y tambi\u00e9n de sabanas, que vende de manera ambulante.

She lives with her family in a humble house in Hodeidah. She is an uneducated woman, but she is a very active and dynamic woman. Asmahan decided to improve the condition of her family. For this reason, she has started her own business selling ready-made children's clothes door-to-door. She found this business to be good for her. She has been in this business for two months. She earns good profits from this business, but most of what she earns goes to the expenses of the family, so she wants to improve her business. To do so, Asmahan asked a loan of 20,000 YER from AMB to purchase more ready-made children's clothes to resell to her customers in her area. \r\n\r\nAsmahan looks forward to expanding her business

He is in a common-law marriage and lives with his wife and their children, who are his first priority. With his loan, he will purchase a variety of rice seeds that adapt well to conditions in his area so that he can have a good harvest. He will also purchase fertilizers and other products to apply to the crops so that he will have a good germination and quality seeds. He will also pay laborers to apply the products and assist on the plantation once he has it developed. This way, he will ensure that he does a good job.\r\n\r\nWhat he hopes is that he can take advantage of the good weather conditions and ground that the area has for this crop. He would also like to put his years of experience with this crop into practice. In addition, he hopes to be able to purchase the best products so that his plantation will have good development and health, as well as a good harvest, and he hopes that he will have an important production in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nWith the income that he hopes to receive from the harvest, he hopes to use it for the well-being and education of his family, achieve some family goals, and continue investing in his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that he has received from FUDECOSUR.

She is a single mother to her son, because her partner abandoned her and doesn't help with the child.  She lives in her home with just her son, the only person who depends on her.\r\n\r\nVeronica works at domestic tasks in the home and takes care of her child, but she also has her own business.  Her business is a beauty salon from which she gets an income for herself and her baby.  She comments that she has been working as a hair stylist for 10 years, work that she learned to do in cosmetology school.  She does all kinds of hairstyles, cuts, dyes, etc.    She maintains the salon in her house and  thus does not have to travel to another place to work.  The day's work begins early, at 7 in the morning, and ends at 7 at night.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from the loan to pay off some debts and also to buy a hair-cutting machine to make her work easier.  With this financial help she can offer more variety in haircut styles for her clients and better service.   Thanks to the loan she will generate more income and she and her son will have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn the future Veronica mainly wants to enlarge her beauty salon, employ more people, and also have an academy with classes in cosmetology.  She has also always wanted to continue studying and finish her university degree, and wants her son to grow strong and well and be a good person.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1607264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay some debts and also to buy a hair-cutting machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-29T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-28T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glenda Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":22.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":22.94},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":24.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":26.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":28.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":32.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":38.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.94},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.18,"local_amount":35.18,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":35.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243526},{"amount":74.52,"local_amount":74.52,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":74.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526665},{"amount":73.96,"local_amount":73.96,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":73.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501121},{"amount":22.47,"local_amount":22.47,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":22.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145082},{"amount":67.46,"local_amount":67.46,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":67.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768718},{"amount":226.41,"local_amount":226.41,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":226.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832460}],"funded_date":"2014-05-30T22:20:26Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":715647,"name":"Sally","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sally is a 20-year-old unwed woman with one child.
