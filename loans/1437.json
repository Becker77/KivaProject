This would also take advantage of the soil's fertility and climate conditions and other factors that favor papaya growing.

His parents could not send him go to school because they lived in poverty. When he grew up, they took him with them to the field, at first to take food to the workers and, when he was older, they taught him how to work the land. This is how he learnt it and how he decided to work in farming. He has always been a farm laborer.

Also, he will invest a part of the loan in planting beans.

He studied through the 9th grade; he was not able to finish school because his father fell ill and Tony had to begin working in order to support his family. Currently, he is married. His wife attends to work around the house and taking care of their two children. Tony makes a living as a baker in a bakery in the city. His work schedule is from 4 a.m. to 5 p.m. He has a very heavy schedule and the long hours prevent him from commuting from home. For this reason, he works from Monday to Saturday. In order to travel to work on Mondays, Tony must leave at 3 a.m. in order to be at work on time. During the week, he sleeps at work. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Tony also works as a farmer since this is how he made a living before he was hired by the bakery. While Tony is at work during the week, his wife takes care of the crops and the cow they possess. This loan will help Tony to buy fertilizers and weed killer to help cultivate his corn crops as well as to pay for labor. \r\n\r\nTony hopes for the future that his children will grow up in a healthy environment and become good people.

He plants corn and sorghum, and his day begins at 4:30 a.m. He arises early to milk his cow and then take her back to the pasture.  It takes him thirty minutes to walk to his job, where he works for six hours and returns home.  In the evenings, he works on the crops.  He will invest the loan in the purchase of seeds, manure, and weed killer.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is for his daughters get an education and be prepared for the future, since he didn\u2019t have that opportunity.

Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Dante, an electrician, and they have children. Together with her husband, Evelyn manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nEvelyn maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Evelyn's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Evelyn is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. \r\n\r\nEvelyn dreams to expand her business more and hopes to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1612721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nLilibeth desires that her business will continue to grow, and she dreams for her children to finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week.

Triunfo, Santa Lucia Milpas Altas, about 20 minutes away from the city of Antigua, Guatemala. They named their group Faith because they have faith that working with Namaste will have a significant effect on their businesses. They will be provided with basic financial training, a business advisor to help them develop and follow a business plan, and a small loan. Within the group there are a variety of businesses such as tortilla sales, making and selling furniture, selling shirts, and a very small store.\nDora (second from left), the woman with the small store, is 52 years old, married and has four grown children, who have finished their education and live with their own families.  She looks after two of her grandchildren. Dora has a fourth grade education and her husband works as a metal worker to contribute to the family income. In her little storefront she sells goods people want daily such as food, drinks and snacks.  She is open every day and doesn\u2019t have much competition because she is one of the few stores in her neighborhood.  She buys her products in Antigua to get a better price.\nHer current net profit is 800 Guatemalan Quetzales and she is projecting a 50% increase to 1200 Guatemalan Quetzales by the end of the nine-month loan cycle.  She will be using her loan to buy more products for her store and also for a new shelf so she can display more of her wares.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1607491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more products for her store and also for a new shelf so she can display more of her wares","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Lucia Milpas Altas, Sacatep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2014-05-29T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-28T16:30:04Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Amalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda Ericelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivania Mariel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":15500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1722.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1722.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.23},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":222.23,"local_amount":1722.22,"processed_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1724.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504261242},{"amount":222.22,"local_amount":1722.28,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-26T09:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1724.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517543542},{"amount":222.22,"local_amount":1722.25,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-26T09:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1724.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026846},{"amount":222.22,"local_amount":1722.13,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1724.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542519114},{"amount":408.62,"local_amount":3166.84,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3171.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561652794},{"amount":157.71,"local_amount":1222.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1224.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581607294},{"amount":319.06,"local_amount":2472.69,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2476.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595165309},{"amount":225.72,"local_amount":1749.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1751.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610562060}],"funded_date":"2014-06-26T12:00:49Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:51:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":712160,"name":"Orbelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Orbelina tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad y habita en casa propia junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus cuatro hijos.

She works as a housewife, and her husband is the sole breadwinner of the family. \r\n\r\nShe is a very dynamic and ambitious woman. She has a lot of housework. Her house lacks many home appliances such as an oven and washing machine and the others, a television and refrigerator, are very old. She wants to change them, and she can't afford them. \r\n\r\nAs a result, she decided to improve the condition of the family. Unfortunately, the income of her husband is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family. For this reason, Sa'ada applied for a loan of 80,000 YER from AMB in order to buy home appliances.\r\n\r\nSa'ada looks forward to renovating her house.

","en":"Dmytryi is a 38-year-old entrepreneur from Pavlograd.  He sells men's leather clothing & other seasonal men's clothing at a local marketplace where he has his own market stall.  He's been at it for 8 years, and is currently seeking a loan of 40,000 hryvnia to stock up on seasonal items: sportswear, T-shirts, shorts and the like, which tend to sell well in the summer.  In spite of the slump his profession has seen due to various economic and political factors in the Ukraine, Dmytryi has seen no reason to despair.  He is committed to replenishing his stock for the summer, and will keep his chin up in the meantime.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1610810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The group's representative is M'Bene, the woman standing to the right of the photo taken of the entire Benkadi 1 Group. With this loan, she is planning on buying one 50-kg sack of fertiliser, one can of herbicide, as well as the labour costs to maintain half a hectare of land. After the harvest, the produce is sold on a village level as well as at the markets of Sikasso to a customer base made up of both men and woman, accepting both credit and cash as payment. She is planning on making an average profit of 90,000 FCFA per season.

It is composed of nine business women who are the backbone of each of their families. They work in textile production and animal husbandry.\n\nMaria is the 31-year-old President of the Trust Bank who is married with four children. She is an enthusiastic and very responsible businesswoman, leader and mother. Each of her children is in school and she is thrilled about this as she realizes that education is the key to a successful future. Fortunately, she was able to attend school but was not able to graduate from high school as she had to work. Maria raises chickens and cattle and hopes for a good return on her investment. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase more chickens to fatten up, sell, and thus create additional income. Her goal is to take care of the daily needs of her household and to see that her children finish school. \n\nMaria takes her job as President of the Trust Bank very seriously and tries to guide the ladies in an intelligent and compassionate manner. She urges them to use the information that they receive each month in the non-formal educational trainings given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. Some of the topics covered include women\u2019s rights and self esteem, nutrition and health as well as the use of medicinal plants. Other subjects covered include effective business practices including accounting, budgeting and customer service. It is the combination of the small loans and non-formal educational segments of the monthly meetings that Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\n\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank are quite grateful to KIVA investors for funding their loans.

She took advantage of her mom\u2019s experience in clothes making, she also saw that her mom worked really hard and decided at 17 years old to work with her to help. This is how, with her income she bought her mom a simple sewing machine, so that her mom could be independent and worked from home.  Katherine used to buy the fabrics, her mom would make the clothes and then Katherine sold the final product. Little by little she bought more sewing machines and negotiated good contracts with education institutions from the area, which she still does to this day.  Her goal is to have an independent shop that can also be a store, this way her children\u2019s future will be secured with a good professional education.\r\nHer biggest challenge is not having the financial resources to achieve her goals quickly.  Katherine is requesting a Kiva loan to buy an embroidery machine, because she usually outsources this and it\u2019s expensive to do.  This way she will be able to satisfy her customer\u2019s needs with finalized products and offer embroidery service that will generate a new source of income making her Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1607447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She had saved some money that she first invested in merchandise such as gold and silver jewelry and clothing. Yakeline later connected with international companies in order to gain access to specialized product lines and boost her sales. Yakeline's husband had previously been the family's sole source of financial support, but purchasing merchandise in higher volume soon increased Yakeline's income. She was then able to contribute financially to her family's well-being. \r\n\r\nYakeline now sells shoes, jewelry, women's and men's clothing, and a variety of cosmetics and personal items.

Her greatest challenge, however, is saving enough money to invest and grow her business. She is now applying for a Kiva loan, her first from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and will use the loan funds to purchase perfume, cream, and clothing. These purchases will boost her inventory, increasing her sales and therefore her profits. \r\n\r\n

previously obtained a 14,000 PHP loan, which she used to purchase more grocery items and other products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education, and in the family's personal, household and business expenditures.<br \/><br \/>She would like to apply for another loan, this one in the amount of 18,000 PHP. She will use this loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products, to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase, with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.<br \/><br \/>Lucila dreams of having her own supermarket some day, and desires to operate a public transportation unit, like a jeepney.

","en":"Lubov is from Ordzhonikidze. She leases a retail outlet at a local shopping center and sells souvenirs and mobile phones there. She has been running the business for 4 years. She opened it at a time when the textile factory, where Lubov then worked as a supervisor, had experienced difficulties and employees stopped receiving salaries. Lubov understood that she had to decide what would be next. And then she got an idea to work in retail in order to open her own store with time. Lubov wants to use the 30 000 hryvnia received from Kiva to purchase souvenirs and mobile products for resale. Lubov then plans to use the additional profit to spend on developing her business and on some personal needs. Her future plans include opening her own store and purchasing a space for
