The new members work in textile production as do most of the women of the Trust Bank. The traditional textiles of Chichicastenango are among the most colorful and beautiful in Guatemala.\r\nJuana, better known as Juanita by the ladies, is the President of the trust bank. She is an enthusiastic 26 year old with three children. Together with her husband the couple works hard to generate enough income to support the family. They produce and sell different kinds of textiles. Taking the long range view, Juanita decided that having one business just was not enough and so she began selling fruit in her community. She is quite happy and pleased with the progress of her fruit business. Juanita is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase thread for her textile business and supplies for her fruit business.\r\nJuanita and the ladies in the \u201cChutzorop Segundo\u201d Trust Bank appreciate the monthly educational training given by a Loan Officer of Friendship Bridge. They learn how to manage their small businesses with seminars on effective business practices, budgeting, accounting, customer service and savings. Other topics include nutrition and health, self esteem and women\u2019s rights as well as the use of medicinal plants. Learning together, the women of the Trust Bank bond even more and encourage each other to be successful.\r\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, for an indigenous women in Guatemala experiencing poverty to walk into a banking institution and secure a loan. KIVA investors are valuable assets to these women who are working quite hard to empower themselves and create better lives for themselves, their families and their rural community in Chichicastenango.

She manages her own household while running her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNelda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she increases her sales.\r\n\r\nNelda dreams of expanding her business in the coming years.

He is married to Virginia, a housewife and mother to their child. Artemeo, together with his wife, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArtemeo maintains a tricycle business. He owns and drives one tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. He starts working early in the morning until late in the evening. There are times when he drives late evening until the wee hours in order to have bigger profits. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 300 in his transportation business every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting an amount of PHP 9,000 for his loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy motorcycle parts for the maintenance of his tricycle unit. He has to maintain his unit in good condition in order to have a regular income for the daily needs of his family. \r\n\r\nArtemeo hopes to open another business and dreams that his relationship with his family grows fonder. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

and at least a three-hour drive from Kenya national grid power. The village sits just a few kilometers from the Masai Mara and serves as a commercial hub for both the Masai residents who live in the town and for those in surrounding smaller villages. Without access to electricity, the residents must rely on generators, kerosene, candles, and small DC solar systems for their energy needs.\r\n\r\nChrispian currently uses kerosene lanterns to light her home and the boutique. Kerosene is expensive and smells unpleasant, leading Chrispian to close the boutique in the evenings. With connection to the micro-grid, Chrispian will keep her shop open later and expand her business to include phone charging. Both of these will allow Chrispian to generate additional revenue, which she plans on saving so she can open her own hair salon in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe solar micro-grid will provide Chrispian a constant and reliable power source to use for lighting and other energy services, such as radios and phone charging. Chrispian will pre-pay for electricity in small bundles using her mobile phone. The solar system will require no maintenance from Crispian, and a large battery bank ensures there will be plenty of power, even on cloudy days. Chrispian will be spending less money on the micro-grid power than she was on kerosene. Furthermore, the solar micro-grid is a lot better for the environment and Chrispian\u2019s health than smoky, toxic kerosene lanterns.\r\n\r\nAside from Chrispian, five other business owners in the village are also a part of the loan connecting to the micro-grid: Lillian, Joseph, Florence, John, and Mikai. They are all looking forward to having reliable power at an affordable rate, which they will also use to grow their businesses. The micro-grid will thus spur economic activity in Nkoilale and provide better and cheaper options for more residents to use energy to improve their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":13425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2574.55,"image":{"id":1613024,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2971,"youtubeId":"h6jv3qb8cOk","title":"Kiva

Her husband is a farmer and they have three children, but only the youngest lives with her.  She is in the 5th grade.\r\n\r\nDoris has been selling clothing for 18 years, but she started a fruits and vegetables business a year ago.  She knows both businesses very well because when her father died it was her mother who taught her these things.  This is how she learned to sell products.  The place she sells from is five km away and she takes the bus every day.  She gets up at 4:30am to prepare breakfast for her husband and daughter, then she goes out to sell and gets home at 3:00 pm. \r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy merchandise so she can continue with the business of selling clothing.  This loan will help Doris do what she enjoys most and she will have an income for the household.\r\n\r\nDoris has many dreams and one of them is to be able to leave her children a place to live, but she needs to remodel her house and build a perimeter wall to provide more security.  She would also like to have a small store in her home and be able to buy a grinding mill for her son so that he can work on his own.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1607377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-05-30T19:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-29T19:40:17Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":32.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.1,"local_amount":30.1,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":30.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243539},{"amount":34.21,"local_amount":34.21,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":34.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526678},{"amount":35.96,"local_amount":35.96,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":35.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009082},{"amount":31.93,"local_amount":31.93,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":31.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501131},{"amount":35.96,"local_amount":35.96,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":35.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562419934},{"amount":37.77,"local_amount":37.77,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":37.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579544720},{"amount":394.07,"local_amount":394.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":394.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145093}],"funded_date":"2014-06-27T19:01:03Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:00:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She is a very well-known woman in her community. She dedicates herself to domestic chores in her home and she also raises and sells chickens. Francisca was raised by parents who were very humble people. They were workers who were also engaged in the sale of chickens and eggs on their own farm. She had three siblings and she is the oldest of them all. She helped with chores on the farm and, for that reason, found it difficult to complete her basic education and only studied to the third grade. She is the mother of 2 children who study in the community's school. They are Francisca's family.\r\n\r\nShe works on her household chores around her home. For 31 years she has raised chickens and sold eggs, after she was taught this work by her parents. She owns a farm of 50 laying hens and 50 broiler chickens. She has been doing this work on her own for more than 10 years and she continues because it is her primary source of income to meet the basic needs of her children. Her husband also does this work in the evenings after working in agriculture in the mornings. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase chickens and laying hens because their flock is lacking and they need more hens and chickens. Some of the money will be invested in improving the farm and buying concentrated feed.\r\nThe dreams she has for the future include having a farm with the best facilities and getting a loan to purchase an incubator to provide a better income and support the education of her children until they are successful professionals. One of them wants to be a veterinary doctor.

He learned this work from his father and remembers that when he turned ten, his father told him, \"It's time to work the land, because this is your lot.\" \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan he is requesting from CrediCampo to buy seeds, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizer in order to grow corn and beans. He will also pay the laborers that will help him prepare the land, plant the crops, and harvest.\r\n\r\nRufino intends to increase his income by selling what he harvests and to improve his quality of life, because loans like this give people with the firm desire of overcoming poverty the support they need in order to keep fighting and get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1608730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to

","en":"Vera works with selling men's shoes and women's clothing. She travels around in the different regional centers of the area, such as Stavische, Skvira and Brusilov. Vera has been in this business for 19 years already, and she has a vast experience with this work. Vera often stores the goods in bags in her garage. She rents sales stalls in different places. Not long ago, Vera's husband suffered a stroke. She continues to nurse him, doing everything possible for his full recovery. \r\n\r\nVera did not ask for a loan of 12,000 hryvnia for business purposes. She has been repairing her home for some time already, but she never had enough money to finish the repairs. The money received from Kiva will be invested in paneling the facade of the house, after first insulating it. She has needed this repair badly for a long time, since the inner walls are moist and fungus will eventually start growing on them. This is very harmful for the health of the entire family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1610819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is currently studying her third year of bookkeeping school. She is single and lives with her parents. \r\n\r\nShe spends her weekends studying since she has to work throughout the course of the week. She is a tailor and learned this trade at age 15 thanks to a course provided by a non-governmental organization in the community where she lives. This work is very good for her since she gained a lot of experience in a short amount of time. She currently works with the government making uniforms for school students. Aside from this work, she has a family business that is a laying hen farm. This brings an income with her family that is apart from her own work. She has it in her home. Thankfully, she does not have to travel to another place to do her work so she saves time and money. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy laying hens and to make repairs to the place where they are kept since the rainy season is near and she has to protect her investments in a good way.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to buy cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy more products, like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings and other products, needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarmen hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her grandchildren a good future.

His wife works in housekeeping. He completed the fifth grade. The children go to school. They are three boys and two girls. The eldest is in the sixth grade, the second in fourth grade, the third in second grade, the fourth in first grade, and the youngest is four years old.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is a farmer. He has done this work since he was with his father who taught him to grow corn and beans. However, he became independent 23 years ago. He also grows basic grains on the side. He does not have other work besides growing corn and beans, but this is for family consumption. Sometimes he works as a day laborer to cover other food expenses. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is applying for with CrediCampo is to buy four sacks of fertilizer, two of sulfate, two of formula, and to grow corn and beans. With the loan he will greatly improve because without it, he could not farm. This is an important necessity because there are five children and two adults - seven in total. It would be difficult to survive without corn and beans since for them they are the basics in the community. \r\n\r\nHe has one, very big dream to be alive with good health to work hard to give his children an education, because the life of a farmer is hard and does not make a lot of income. He does not want this for his children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1608864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy four sacks of fertilizer, two of sulfate, two of formula, and to grow corn and beans.

However, she is going through an economic crisis that will not allow her to continue helping Carrosio to pay for his studies.

He is in his thirties and since 2010 he has supported his family by running several businesses. He has a shop selling phones and phone accessories and another selling shoes, radios and TVs.  Price advantages (selling at low prices) and quality products from his rivals with high business capital, are challenges facing Robson. Together with those challenges, he makes sure that he keeps good relations and improves through problem solving so as to compete. Robson starts his business from 7 am to 8 pm daily and is able to make a good profit. <br \/><br \/>He is applying for his twentieth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. With his previous loans, all of which were paid back successfully, Robson opened a new branch and restocked more products.

As the family has only seasonal income, she decided to start dairy farming and seek a loan from local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. The startup program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Patma's application was approved under the framework of this program for a loan of 3,000 GEL for purchasing cattle and building a cattle shed. After this, the family will have a stable income that will enable them to cover everyday costs as well as expand their agribusiness in the future.

Meet Emmanuel, a father of three from Kisii which is a rural town in Kenya known for tea and dairy farming. For the last 10 years, Emmanuel has been selling eggs and tea from his farm as well as engaging in other small businesses to take care of his family. \r\nTypical of smallholder rural farmers in Kenya, Emmanuel leads a low income lifestyle. He wants to changes this. Emmanuel is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. His biggest challenge has always been raising capital to purchase inputs and expand his agribusiness enterprise. By purchasing a dairy cow, Emmanuel will get an alternative source of income that is sufficient to repay the loan. Cows produce milk every day, providing a more regular and predictable income. \r\nEmmanuel enjoys selling his farm produce. \"I've grown up farming, and selling produce to generate income for my family is the best part of the cycle. I always look forward to selling my produce at the market\" he stated. \r\nEmmanuel promised to name the cow he will acquire Nyakanga. He is very optimistic that Nyakanga will be full of health and productive. He has already set aside land for growing fodder. \r\n\"I am too committed to diversifying to divert funds to other projects. My highest monthly expense is family related... but I am focused on increasing my income so I will not be tempted to spend a KIVA lender's hard-earned money on consumables.\"\r\n\r\nYour loan will go a long way in helping Emmanuel boost his income levels and elevate his family's quality of life. \t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1612941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3268.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3853.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3957.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4099.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4174.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4315.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4403.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4522.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4694.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4770.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4907.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5031.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.2,"local_amount":7904.37,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8021.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570898},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":3828.76,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3885.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054258},{"amount":48.35,"local_amount":4190.18,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4252.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547432},{"amount":49.52,"local_amount":4292.14,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4355.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680402},{"amount":48.5,"local_amount":4203.23,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4265.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624698},{"amount":51.91,"local_amount":4498.86,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4565.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193771},{"amount":106.16,"local_amount":9200.36,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":9336.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261738},{"amount":113.01,"local_amount":9794.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":9939.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600005},{"amount":44.91,"local_amount":4087.75,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4148.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"payment_id":681376881}],"funded_date":"2014-06-03T18:33:37Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:47:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":716554,"name":"Robina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robina is a mother of three children, two of whom go to school.
