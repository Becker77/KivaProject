Meet Peter, a mixed farmer in Kisii, which is a rural town in Kenya. For the last 16 years, this father of four has been selling milk and tea leaves to earn his family a decent living. \r\n\r\nToday, Peter is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. The purpose of the purchase is to increase his milk output. \"There is a high milk demand in my village. Families are relying on the milk I produce, and I am afraid my supply cannot meet the demand,\" he stated.\r\n \r\nPeter's biggest challenges are raising capital and finding affordable labour. He already has two dairy cows on his farm named Osamo and Nyabarati. The third cow will help use pasture he has already prepared.\r\n \r\nPeter plans on using the extra income from milk sales to pay the loan.

spouse. By profession he is a retailer with a bakery shop that is the only source of income to fulfill all of his needs. Iqbal wants to purchase different types of eatable items e.g. biscuits, Nimko, cold drinks and juices for reselling purposes.

Gudia hopes the loan will help her increase their income, which will help her purchase the needed study materials for her children's education and pay their school fees.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are grateful to Kiva and its lenders for this help and support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1613793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Vulnerable Groups","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Deoghar, Jharkhand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-05-31T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-30T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumiya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bechu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asiya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-01T18:48:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":713154,"name":"Santusa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santusa se dedica a la venta de caldo y comida, ella es una persona responsable por ese motivo le invitaron a participar en el banco comunal \u201cLlapallanchis Llankasunchis\u201d y en esta oportunidad  requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar insumos como por ejemplo papas, verduras, fideos y carnes, ella agradece y valora el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas mensuales con mucha responsabilidad.","en":"Santusa sells soups and meals.

He sells sequins, pearls, thread, precious stones, silk, needles and wooden frames for embroidery. The embroidery material for bridal dresses is very expensive, but its turnover is very high. \r\n\r\nDue to the high cost of materials, he is facing a shortage and is unable to purchase expensive raw materials to sell. Therefore, Asia has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan. With this loan, her husband can fill the shortage of embroidery materials.

A supplier comes to her home and provides all the raw materials she needs to make the embroidery; and she completes her tasks with her daughters using wooden frames. \r\n\r\nYasmeen wants to start buying her raw materials directly, and to sell her embroidered items herself in the market so she can make more profit. Therefore, Yasmeen has asked for a Kiva loan to buy raw materials and wooden frames, so she can make more embroidered dresses to sell, and make more income.\r\n \r\nShe hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her increased sales.

He sews leather and rexine shoes through a machine, and after that attaches the soles through stitching with his hands. In this way he is getting income for his family. He has been making shoes at home, and now he wants to increase his business on a wider level. But he does not have the amount needed to buy initial raw materials for making shoes. Therefore, Safia has requested a loan for her husband so he can buy the necessary materials. This will help him to continue his business.

He has been feeding his family through the generated income from this fruit shop. \r\n\r\nNowadays, the needs of his family have suddenly increased and he does not have other sources to cope with these needs. So he decided to expand his current business. He wants to increase his stock on a daily basis so that he can maximize sales of his fruit.

In addition, he has another land plot nearby, with two unheated greenhouses. In the past Sergei used to work in the fire safety department of the town of Enerhodar.  Then he started to gradually develop his own business. There was not enough time to do everything, and he left his firefighter's job. At present the vegetable garden is the main source of income for Sergei and his family.\r\n\r\nSergei needs a sum of 10,000 UAH in order to buy seeds for a second planting of tomatoes. His plans include expanding his business, building additional greenhouses, improving the heating system on his main land plot and install heating at his secondary land plot. Sergei has a well-managed farm and a nice house; he keeps everything in good shape. It is evident that he is dedicated to his work and wants to be successful in it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1610831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase tomato seeds for planting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-05-31T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-06-30T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":151.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":363.9,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5131.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":73.6,"payment_id":561669494},{"amount":359.26,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5131.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":78.24,"payment_id":579589179}],"funded_date":"2014-05-31T22:48:45Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:43:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":713276,"name":"Justina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He also engages in personal businesses to make extra money.\r\n\r\nJulius is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. He enjoys very much taking care of animals. His hobby is milking early in the morning and late in the evening. He chops fodder in between the day and fills water in troughs for the cows to drink. He regularly inspects his animals to ensure they are healthy and the milk quality is great. \r\n\r\nJulius finds farming enjoyable, lucrative and full of growth opportunities. However, his biggest challenge is the poor roads leading to the market. This makes it expensive and time consuming to ferry farm produce.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Julius seeks to improve his family's living standard.

There is a lot of demand for fodder for those people who keep cattle. His shop is situated in a poor society and most of his customers took fodder on a credit basis and do not pay back for many days. Now, his credit amount has gone out of its limit.  Even he cannot buy fresh fodder to sell. \r\n\r\nSafia is a poor lady and cannot sustain such kind of irregularities in payments because fodder selling is the only one way of getting income for her family. Therefore, Safia has requested a loan for her husband so he would be able to buy fodder to sell.  Now, her husband will avoid selling fodder on a credit basis.

Meet Rebecca from Kisii, an area of Kenya with constant rainfall throughout the year. The mother of three has been a farmer for 21 years! She keeps poultry and dairy cattle for eggs, meat, and milk. It is on the same small plot of land that she grows tea and bananas. She makes a living selling produce from her farm to the local market.\r\n \r\nRebecca is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. Compared to items from other sectors, promotion of milk is very easy. There is no need for unique stores and costs of promotion are very low for any dairy. \"The only way to grow as a dairy farmer is by producing more milk through improved management, improved cattle breeds, and purchasing more cattle,\" said Rebecca. Tending to animals is what she stated to be the most enjoyable thing about her business. \"Keeping animals is like having different type of babies. They need all the attention they can get if you want them to be productive,\" she said. \r\n\r\nPoor roads and lack of market are big challenges to farmers from Kisii like Rebecca. She also finds her children's high school fees prohibitive to business expansion. With your loan, Rebecca will increase her income and improve her family's standard of

Since joining Juhudi, she has had access to a low interest rate loan without even having a collateral; this enabled her to have some assets in her name. Today, Rodah is before you seeking another loan to purchase a dairy cow. She has the room and resources on her farm to sustain more dairy animals. With more milk, Rodah will be able to generate enough income to comfortably repay the loan and meet her high monthly family-related expenses.

The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\r\n\r\nJeniva is married and has ten children. She is a landlord as well as a treasurer in her church. Both she and her husband are farmers. They have been farming for forty years now and they are currently growing maize, beans, vegetables, bananas, and sugarcane on their farm. Jeniva is excited about beekeeping as it will earn her some income from the sale of honey.\r\n\r\nThis is Jeniva's first loan with Honey Care and she plans to use the proceeds from her beehives to educate her children through high school.

This fertile area supports a thriving agricultural community where fruit like plums, peaches and apples are grown. Many also work in textile production. Some time ago, a group of ten women organized a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cFlores de Chontala\u201d or \u201cFlowers of Chontala\u201d. Their goal is to expand their businesses, acquire knowledge, empower themselves and eliminate poverty in their lives. The Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge, which combines small loans and education, is a wonderful and effective way for them to achieve these goals.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is Herminia. She is a formidable woman with one year of formal education and eight children. She has a tamale business and her entire family participates in the preparation and sale of this delicious and typical Guatemalan dish. Herminia and her children sell tamales each weekend in their community. Because of the success of the business, she added more items to the menu, including a corn drink called \u201catole\u201d, and \u201ctostadas\u201d which are tortillas topped with black beans, salsa and guacamole. At the same time, Herminia has a traditional textile business. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase ingredients for her tamale business as well as thread and supplies for her textile business.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Herminia is quite pleased and happy because she has been able to watch her four youngest children not only complete primary school but also to attend higher educational institutions. She knows that education is a vital key to a more successful future. Her fellow Trust Bank members also realize this and are eager to participate in the monthly educational seminars given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. The women learn about relevant subjects which they immediately apply to their small businesses. Some topics include budgeting, accounting, customer service and indebtedness. Other themes are self esteem and women\u2019s rights, health and hygiene as well as nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cFlores de Chontala\u201d Trust Bank extends gratitude to KIVA investors for supporting their goals and dreams. They are committed to a more prosperous future. We look forward to reporting on their progress! Thank you, KIVA investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1614019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping.\r\n\r\nSimon is married and has eight children.

She and her husband work in agriculture fields as daily wage workers. \r\n\r\nRajeshree has rented agriculture land, where she cultivates crops. As per the deal, she is supposed to share half of the harvest with the landowner and keep the rest. She usually sells the crop to make some profit. Her family earns 5,000 Indian rupees (INR) per month. This income is hardly sufficient to manage the day-to-day expenses. Rajeshree is also finding it difficult to pay for her children\u2019s education.

He is doing effort and earning money for the survival of both of them. \r\n\r\nHe wants to buy billy goats to sell on the Eid-ul-Azha because many people like to buy billy goats to immolate on Eid-Ul-Azha. This is very profitable, but he does not have enough savings to buy billy goats.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Afshan has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can buy billy goats to sell.

Her husband has been running a General Store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap biscuits etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store as well. He speaks with monotonous tone which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relations his sales have increased a lot but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Asmat requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits etc. Asmat thanks Kiva and field partner BRAC

with his family. He is the father of three sons and two daughters. He is a cattle trader and does most of his trading from within his home area. He breeds cattle in his yard as well and sells the bull calves to the butchers. He has to feed the calf for one or two years until they have grown up and are healthy, which is a very lengthy and expensive procedure. He also trades buffaloes as well. He buys buffaloes at a low price and sells them to the people at a profit.\r\n\r\nHe has been producing milk and breeding from his buffaloes. His production of milk and his breeding procedure have been effected because he is unable to cope with the demand. \r\n\r\nTariq Mehmood wants to buy a buffalo to keep his income constant but he has already invested all his savings into the expenses of his dairy farm. He does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy a buffalo to continue his business smoothly.  Therefore, Tariq Mehmood requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so he would be able to purchase a new buffalo for his business.  He hopes that lenders will support him and this loan will prove productive for his business as well.\r\n\r\nHe is very impressed with the Kiva loan cycle system; he is thankful to the lenders.

For many days his rickshaw has not been working properly because of the amount of use it regularly gets. He feels that most of its parts are out of order, so he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However due to a lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore Parveen has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw.
