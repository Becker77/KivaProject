in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. He owns a general store in which he sells shampoo, bath soaps, detergents, biscuits, rice, sugar, cooking oil, etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store, some of his relatives like to purchase from his general store as well. He speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town, and that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relations, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stocks to cope with the demand. To cope with the demand of his customers, he wants to buy more stocks for his store, but he does not have a sufficient amount to buy more stocks.

His wife is a housewife. They are very humble and hardworking people. She is the one who is in charge of the duties of the home. They have hens and he helps her husband with milking the cows. Only two are studying and the rest support Ra\u00fal with the work.\r\n\r\nHe is a cattle trader; he buys and sells. When the business isn't so good he works in agriculture. He has been doing this activity for more than 30 years; when he was little, his father taught him that life is only lived well when one is respectful and is respected as the person that he is. Because of this, he has achieved being able to get ahead up to today: he milks 4 cows that produce cheese and milk, with which he has secured the livelihood of the house a little. The distance he travels is variable since he does not always go to the same place. When he takes in the harvest, he sells one part and the rest is for consumption. He works in the morning from 6:00 AM to 12:00 noon. In the afternoon he works with the cattle business.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy cattle for grazing, to sell it later. With this, he will generate income for his home, with which he will improve his assets and will be able to grow production.

A supplier comes to her home and provides her with all the raw materials for knitting embroidery, and she completes her tasks over a wooden frame. She wants to sell knitted embroidery directly into the market so that she can earn more profit for her family. She has become expert in her art and wants to buy raw material on her own so that she can sell her handmade embroidery in her hometown.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Nafeesa has requested a loan to buy raw material so she can knit more embroidered dresses to sell and could generate maximum income. \r\nShe hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her large sales.

He is living happily with his family in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. He is a metal turner by profession and he works over a lathe machine. He manufactures and renews the spare parts of vehicles such as motorbikes, motorcars and auto rickshaws. He renews the interior parts of vehicles' engines, turbines and radiators. He has been doing this business for ten years and until this time, his business has been stable. Due to continuously working over lathe machine, some of the machine's important parts have been tearing off, and urgently needs to be replaced. Without the replacement of affected parts, the whole lathe machine mechanism is affected. He does not have a sufficient amount to buy spare parts to fix the problem of his lathe machine and could buy cutting tools. Therefore, Bilal Ashraf requested a loan so that he would be able to cover the cost of repairing his lathe machine.

Shabana has been saving for many days to buy a new auto rickshaw for her husband but the savings are mostly spent on household expenses. Now she wants to buy a new auto rickshaw for her husband, but she does not have enough cash in hand to buy one.

He lives with his family in Lahore, Pakistan.\r\n\r\nSheikh Waseem owns a bakery and sweets shop in his hometown. He sells a variety of cakes, rusks, milk, biscuits, juices, cold drinks and different kinds of sweets. Earlier, his father ran the sweet shop but due to his old age, Sheikh Waseem looks after all the matters. He purchases the inventory in large quantities from a nearby bakery and general store and sells it at his shop. Now he wants to offer more types of sweets to his customers, but he does not have a sufficient amount to buy these additional sweets.

With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is an old member and she has been taking loans according to the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nSabiran belongs to a poor family and it is very difficult for her to cover all the household expenses with poor earnings. In fact, her husband is a hawker by profession and sells different kinds of hair oils by bicycle. He sells mustard oil, avocado oil, castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, safflower oil, etc. He calls in the streets loudly to consumers and offers all these hair oils. He is famous for his oil to protect hair from falling. He wants to buy a large quantity of hair oil to sell for the growth of his business and to overcome poverty. Therefore, Sabiran requested a loan for her husband, so he can buy more hair oil. Sabiran is very impressed with this honorable support. She thanks Kiva and Field Partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1609526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

Recently his rickshaw has not been working properly through regular use. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of new rickshaw. Therefore Shakeela has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

He is a married person, and he has to look after his old parents also. He spends little time with his family, due to his busy business. <br \/><br \/>Hassan Dar owns a hardware shop in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. He sells hardware goods, such as iron nails, nuts, bolts, door locks, door handles, and cutting blades. His shop is situated in the hardware market, and it is challenging for him to sell his products among his competitors. Because in his area, there are many industries available. To cope with the competitors he has to maintain the stock of each spare part, so that he will not have to refuse any customer. He wants to increase the stock of his shop to cope with the demand, and to earn maximum profit as well. <br \/><br \/>Nowadays, he is unable to buy inventory for his shop, because he has been spending most of his income on household expenses.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of two daughters and two sons. Her husband is a rickshaw driver, by profession. He has been running an auto rickshaw for the past ten years.<br \/><br \/>Due to excessive use, the rickshaw body has become damaged, and some parts of it are not working properly. Because of this, he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair the rickshaw and replace its body, as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost. Therefore, Nazmeen has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will use the loan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairs and body replacement for the rickshaw. This will enable him to continue his business. Nazmeen is so much thankful to Kiva and BRAC

is a 54-year old married woman living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. Her son has manufactured spare parts for sewing machine for many years. He buys steel scrap material from the market, melts it, and then  injects it into the dies to give it a specific shape. In this way, he manufactures the spare parts, sells them at the market and makes enough income to contribute to the family's livelihood.\r\n\r\nHer son wants to change the nature of his work; he wants to buy new sewing machines and its spares parts rather than manufacturing the parts. However, due to lack of funds, he is unable to purchase sewing machines.  This is the reason that Munawar requests a loan for her son to buy sewing machines and spare parts so that he can increase his sales. She expects a boost in her earning and wishes to spend part of the profits on the expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nMunawar has four children and barely manages to meet their needs. She needs to provide them with good food, proper health, and an education. She needs to earn additional income to support her family. She is in her seventh loan cycle with BRAC Pakistan and it will be first loan with Kiva. \r\n\r\nMunawar is very thankful to the Kiva and field partner, BRAC

Her son has  run a tailoring shop for many years as he takes orders from boutique owners and sews ladies clothing on order. \r\n\r\nHis shop is situated near the house in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. One of his brothers and a few appointed tailors, help him to sew the fabric. In this way, he generates  income for his family and employs others. He belongs to the middle standard family. Due to low earnings, he is unable to provide a better living standard for his sibling, parents and his own family. A major portion of his income is divided among the tailors. \r\n\r\nHe faces tough times due to the low income. He can not do any other business because he is not skillful in any other profession, so he decided to expand his current enterprise. \r\n\r\nHe does not want to sew the garments on order because the contractors criticize and find drawbacks in his completed shipments.  He wants to buy his own fabric and a professional sewing machine to sew garments and sell them directly to the retailers.  \r\n \r\nNasreen has requested a Kiva loan through BRAC Pakistan for her son to buy  a professional sewing machine, equipment, and fabric to make garments. She  is happy to receive the loan and thanks Kiva and their field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

The group is comprised of nine members and is managed by a board of directors where Rufina is president.  The members of the association are engaged in various businesses including a carpentry workshop, artisanal reed flutes, sewing aprons, and selling cheese, automobile accessories, food, and T-shirts.  \r\n\r\nThe loan they are taking out will benefit small businesses where Rufina is a member.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago by the invitation of an advisor that came to visit her in her home.  Currently, she has a carpentry workshop business and discloses that her husband worked in a carpentry shop before they got married.

She was married but is now a single mother of 4 children, of which none are at home with her since they have started their own families.  She only takes care of two grandchildren that live with her, and they are the only ones who depend on her financially.  \r\n\r\nFelicita is a farmer, and she learned the trade from a young age because her family worked as farmers and her father taught her how to grow corn and beans among other produce.  Her sources of income include agriculture, raising poultry, planting vegetables, and raising pigs and some cattle.  Since she separated from her husband, she has had to fight through her work to get her children ahead.  She works five hours a day.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase agricultural supplies to grow corn, beans, sorghum and others.

However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult. Therefore, his wife Parveen has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at profitable prices.

After her divorce from her husband, she was left alone and became financially dependent on her retired parents.  She didn't have experience or education to work and feed herself or her child.  Fotima became a saleswoman in a shop selling food and cold drinks, but earned a tiny salary, which was not even enough to buy food.  Work in retail became Fotima's only option to pay off her debts, and she decided to open a stand at the local market and start her own business.

She is a housewife and looks after her family at home. \r\n\r\nHer husband owns an oil shop in which he sells different types of hair-using oils, such as Avocado oil, Castor oil, Coconut oil, olive oil, Safflower oil etc. He has been running this business for the last seven years. He buys hair oils from the main market at wholesale rate and resells at profit rates in his shop.\r\nHe manages his household necessities from his own shop as well. He speaks with monotonous tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. \r\n\r\nDue to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His hair oil shop is very famous in town, which is the reason his business is running well. He wants to increase his business, therefore,  Zahida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband so that he would be able to buy more stocks of hair oils for resale.\r\n \r\nZahida seems very glad, and thanks Kiva and it's field partner, BRAC

She has a primary education.  Due to their poverty, she was not able to provide education to her sons. Now they are grown up and are working as masons.\r\n\r\nAfter her husband's death, Arati has been engaged in her husband's business of puffed rice. She sells the puffed rice as tiffin (tea-time) snacks in their area.  Puffed rice is a very popular and a common snack in India.  It is made by heating sand in a pot, and then throwing in grains of rice.  The rice puffs up and is separated from the sand with a strainer.  It is called 'MURI' in the Bengali language. It is very popular and used on a wide variety of secular and religious occasions, or even just munched plain. So Arati works hard all day long to make this, and her sons help to deliver it to different shops in the market.  In order to cope with the growing needs of her family, she wants to enlarge her business.\r\n\r\nSo Arati has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase more ingredients for her business.  She hopes it will help her to fulfill the local demand and earn more profit through her business.\r\n\r\nShe wants to expand her business in order to strengthen the family economy and have a secure future for her family.\r\n\r\nShe will always be grateful to BJS and Kiva for this financial

However, due to financial constraints he is not in a suitable position to buy all of these products for his business. Therefore Lailma has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

She is the mother of three children. Her husband is a turner by profession; he works over a lathe machine. He manufactures and renews the spare parts of vehicles such as motorbikes, motor cars, and auto rickshaws. He renews the interior parts of vehicle and bike engines, such as turbines and radiators. He has been doing this business for many years, and his business is well established. He wants to buy damaged spare parts at a low cost, and then sell them for a higher price after repairing and renewing them. He is a poor person and does not have sufficient cash on hand to buy used parts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sumaira has requested a loan for her husband so he can buy used parts for renewal. She hopes that this loan will prove productive for the business, as well as for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1610437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machine

She is a hardworking and brave mother who is helping her family by providing tailoring services in her community. Being a mother she wants to provide better facilities to her children. This is the reason she is doing extraordinary, hard work to keep her children smiling. She has been sewing cloths since the birth of her two children, when she observed that her husband failed to provide all necessities for her children. Then she decided to start tailoring at home and now she is sewing clothes in her community. She wants to enhance the beauty of her stitching, so she wants to buy a Juki machine. The professional people use this machine for tailoring because of its good speed and its work is very fine. She knows the techniques of tailoring very well. Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives and the local community people.  She has requested a loan to buy the new sewing machine and some packs of zippers and buttons to meet the increasing demand.

Bimala and her husband, Paresh, both attended school until grade 10.\r\n\r\nBimala is a housewife, and her husband is a farmer. Her husband decided to farm, as they have their own land and her husband has experience in this field. He grows different vegetables in different seasons, but it does not provide much profit to run the family well. So, they have decided to cultivate rice paddy on their land.

At one time he was in a relationship, but he separated from his life partner for personal reasons.  He is currently single, and he has five children.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been farming for five years.  He learned this from his father, who has been farming forever.  Besides growing corn and beans he also does extra jobs like cutting wood, for example.  Every time someone looks for him he goes because he knows that he will earn a couple of dollars that will be used for food for his children.  The land that he will cultivate is 15 minutes from his house.  He gets there by walking.  His older children help him when it is time to clear the field in order to have it prepared.  He says that his schedule depends upon how much work he has.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in preparing the land for planting.  He will buy fertilizer, seeds, pesticides and herbicides now that the winter season is approaching.  He will do this with the help of his children.  He does not pay people to help him.  However, he does invest in the agricultural supplies.  It behooves him to buy them in order to work the land.  This way he will securely have a start on the food for his children and for himself.  His wife abandoned him, and the children are under his care.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he wishes to have what is most needed by his family.  Therefore, he hopes to always work while God gives him health and life.  The loan will help him to satisfy the need that he now has to buy supplies in order to be ready.  Now that winter is coming he will be prepared to start cultivating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1610094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, seeds, pesticides and herbicides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-02T01:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-02T01:20:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Sim\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":54.16,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":54.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833898},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":145.84,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":145.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536026}],"funded_date":"2014-06-03T09:37:38Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":717061,"name":"Raquel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raquel is 38 years old, married, and has one child who is in school.\r\n\r\nRaquel is in the agricultural business, pig fattening in the Philippines.

She learnt the agricultural trade at a very early age from her parents. She wants to utilize her experience. She plans to cultivate and sell the tea leaves in the local market and in the stores of the city.\r\n\r\nSo, she has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase tea saplings, good manure and other necessary agricultural inputs.\r\nHer goals are to improve her quality of life and strengthen her assets for her family.

her second year of college study via distance learning.  She's still single and living with her parents and two siblings, and only her mother and father depend on her.\r\n\r\nIsirma is currently working in a restaurant where she sells pupusas [stuffed tortillas].  She has done this work for two years.  She decided to work in this place to support herself in her studies.  Her parents, because of their level of poverty, could not send her to school.  However, she has decided to work hard so she can keep on studying this year and, God willing, she'll be able to graduate.\r\n\r\nHer job is about 15 minutes from her house on the bus.  She works from 6 a.m. until 1 p.m. from Monday through Friday, because she studies on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's requesting from CrediCampo is to buy three sacks of soil amendments and a liter of poison.  They'll rent the plot of land where she'll grow the corn.  They already have it but with the loan she'll finish paying.  This will help her a lot because the salary she earns making pupusas doesn't give her enough money all at once.  That way she'll buy everything for the farming.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to be able to keep on studying, get an education, get a good job, and help her parents.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1610115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to

Muhabbat herself sells men's and women's shoes at the district's central market. Muhabbat bring the goods in from the city. In addition, she also sews traditional women's dresses from her home. She has been doing this for the past 12 years. She enjoys sewing the dresses in various styles. \r\n\r\nMuhabbat and her family worked indefatigably to build their home. She always dreamed of living in a beautiful home with every comfort. To do this she has been saving money to install plastic rimmed windows and doors. These plastic windows and doors have become very popular and convenient recently. But this isn't their main benefit. These doors and windows are useful: they keep heat in, which is quite important for humans, especially in the cold winter months. Muhabbat doesn't have the money to buy the windows and doors so she has applied for a loan. She thanks the organization Arvand in advance for the timely assistance, and hopes to continue to work with them. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1610696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":" purchase and install plastic windows and doors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-06-02T02:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-02T02:40:07Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":758},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":754.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":767.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":805.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":814.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":835.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":860.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":873.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":899.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":934.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":996.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.39},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":702.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302965},{"amount":155.39,"local_amount":758,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":760.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585764},{"amount":154.64,"local_amount":754.33,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":757.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081347},{"amount":1596.47,"local_amount":7787.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7816.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562229}],"funded_date":"2014-06-17T12:43:39Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":713934,"name":"Pedro Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pedro tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad vive en la comunidad de el sardinal desde la edad de 9 a\u00f1os, el estudio en la escuela de la comunidad hasta tercer grado de primaria aprendi\u00f3 lo b\u00e1sico  como es leer y escribir dice que hubiera deseado haber podido ser un profesional pero lamentablemente no fue posible ya que el era el \u00fanico hijo var\u00f3n y se dedico a trabajar con su padre en labores del campo siembra de granos besicos y hortalizas, tambi\u00e9n trabajaba en haciendas en las temporadas de corte de caf\u00e9 para ganar dinero extra y asi comprar sus cosas personales.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1614404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

He sells apples, bananas, and oranges in his shop. Presently, he is interested in offering more variety to his customers, which will help him to increase his net income and savings as well. Moreover, he has decided to sell vegetables from his shop as well. However due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult. Therefore, Kalsoom has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her elder son to purchase variety of fruits and vegetables from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price. With the profit, her son wants to grow his business in the future.

He is 45 years old. He went to school through the 6th grade. He wasn't able to stay in school due to the death of his father. He had to take the reins in the home and support his family Now he is married and has three children. One of them is still in college. His wife travelled to another part of the country to work and thus help her husband give their child and education. The other two children are married.  \r\n\r\nJuan worked as a bus driver, but he had to stop working because of the crime that wouldn't let him keep working. Now he has been growing jicama for about 6 years. It gives him good results to cover his son's education expenses. He also has a small automobile tire repair workshop which generates daily income to pay for his son's education expenses along with what his spouse contributes. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking  CREDICAMPO for is to buy an air compressor. The one he had before was ruined and can't be repaired. In addition, he needs to stock his tire workshop so he can have some ready for sale. \r\n\r\nJuan is planning on not farming any more and spending more time in his workshop. It is more profitable and brings in daily income to help his son finish his education, because he never had that opportunity. His biggest dream is for his workshop to be in better condition so he can better serve his customers and thus have more income to allow for a dignified life. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1610175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an air compressor since the one he had before was ruined and can't be repaired.

Her husband has no steady income to fulfill the basic needs of his family and give them a decent lifestyle.\r\n\r\nTulsi is very energetic, enthusiastic and determined to shape her future through sheer hard work and cooperation.

He feels that most of its parts are out of order, so he is unable to generate any amount of income. He decided to buy a new auto rickshaw because it is useless to pay more as a repairing cost on this ten years-used rickshaw. \r\n\r\nDue to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of new rickshaw. Therefore, Naseem has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

To increase income, he wants to turn his enterprise toward progress. For the purchasing of fruits, he does not have sufficient cash in hand; he tried to borrow some money from his friends and relatives but nobody helped him. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Aroosa has requested a loan for her husband so that he would be able to buy additional fruits to sell in the evening.

For the past many days his rickshaw has not been working properly, because of regular use. He believes that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to a lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. Therefore, Fouzia has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. She will use this loan to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will enable him to continue his business.

has spent eight years in rice production. She is married and has four children. She would like to use a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer, during rice production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase production. She wishes to invest profits from her farming in her business, so that in the future she will be able to acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.<br \/><br \/>The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

","en":"Farrogat is a female entrepreneur. She has   good analytical abilities. This is why she is always able to project what kind of wares will be in demand in her region, stocks up on these wares and makes a profit from her sales. She has a small store at her home. She offers everything that is needed for the home and that homemakers may wish for: household goods, groceries, office supplies, beverages, ice cream etc. Farrogat has five years of experience in this business. She started slowly by buying small quantities of goods every day. Now she has expanded her business, and sales agents deliver their merchandise to her store themselves. It can be said that her small vending business is able to  stand up against the competition, and her wares always find buyers. Farrogat plans to buy a vertical refrigerator. She estimates that she needs additional funds to realize these plans. If she were to save up for the purchase, she will lose an opportunity to increase her sales and earn more. This is why Farrogat has applied for a loan. She truly hopes that Arvand will help her and she will be able to continue growing her business successfully.\r\n\r\nFarrogat is the loving mother of four and a devoted wife. Her husband is a migrant worker and sends money transfers to help the family. Farrogat has a college degree. The theoretical knowledge acquired during her college years help her develop and manage her business. Farrogat thanks everyone in advance for their support and wishes prosperity for every family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1611033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator for ice cream","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-06-02T19:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-02T19:10:14Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farogat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":644.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":665.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":690.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":136.86,"local_amount":644.07,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":670.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302966},{"amount":141.38,"local_amount":665.3,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":692.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585765},{"amount":146.76,"local_amount":690.63,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":718.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081348}],"funded_date":"2014-06-02T20:36:20Z","paid_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":717003,"name":"Fatoumata's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe  a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place durant le second semestre de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013.
