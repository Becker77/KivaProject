Es hijo \u00fanico y vive con su madre, su t\u00eda y su primo. Su madre y su t\u00eda ya est\u00e1n retiradas y su primo trabaja en la Alcald\u00eda de Cali, vinculado a proyectos sociales. A pesar de las dificultades econ\u00f3micas que tuvieron y gracias a las becas de padrinazgo que obtuvo por su excelencia acad\u00e9mica, David se pudo graduar como Comunicador Social\/Periodista en la Universidad del Valle.\n\nDavid tiene el sue\u00f1o de realizar una Maestr\u00eda en Guion en University College of London y para lograrlo necesita solicitar el apoyo de Kiva, puesto que es la \u00fanica forma para poder cubrir los gastos de ex\u00e1menes de idioma y aplicaci\u00f3n a las universidades. Una vez realice su maestr\u00eda y regrese a Colombia, David anhela trabajar haciendo cine documental para contribuir al desarrollo del pa\u00eds y poder mostrar no solo las situaciones que se viven en Colombia, sino tambi\u00e9n para mostrar las posibles soluciones. \n\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia: \n\nA pesar de que cuento con el apoyo de mi familia para cumplir este sue\u00f1o, mis padres no pueden llegar a cubrir gastos tan elevados como estos debido a su limitada situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica. Actualmente, soy parte de un grupo de investigaci\u00f3n  y trabajo como voluntario en una junta de acci\u00f3n comunal. Durante los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os de mi carrera en Comunicaci\u00f3n Social y Periodismo trabaj\u00e9 en la Cinemateca de Universidad del Valle, junto con el profesor y realizador Oscar Campo y la Directora Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, con quienes coordinaba la programaci\u00f3n del \u00e1rea de no ficci\u00f3n. All\u00ed present\u00e9, investigu\u00e9 y publiqu\u00e9 textos sobre los trabajos presentados, que esencialmente se caracterizaban por los cruces que se generaban entre las coyunturas sociales de la educaci\u00f3n y medio ambiente y el documental. \n\nEsta experiencia me motiv\u00f3 a desarrollar como tesis de grado un documental-ensayo llamado \u201ccon una gota empieza el aguacero\u201d sobre la Conservaci\u00f3n las cuencas que surten de agua diversas ciudades de Colombia, el cual hice apoyando a la Junta de Acci\u00f3n Comunal de la vereda La Carolina-Corral de Piedra. Este trabajo fue premiado con la Beca Colombia Biodiversa de la Fundaci\u00f3n Alejandro \u00c1ngel E. El haber trabajado en la Cinemateca y haber participado del Diplomado en Documental de Creaci\u00f3n \u201cMirada de dos mundos\u201d en el a\u00f1o 2008, me llevaron a profundizar m\u00e1s sobre la representaci\u00f3n de la realidad, mediante el uso de nuevas tecnolog\u00edas, soportes y formas de contar.\n\nAl realizar estudios de Maestr\u00eda en el exterior podr\u00e9 tener otros referentes culturales. El cambio de perspectiva puede ayudarme a ver con otra \u00f3ptica las virtudes y riquezas pero tambi\u00e9n los problemas que la sociedad colombiana tiene a\u00fan por solucionar, y las posibilidades de contribuir a estas soluciones sobre todo desde un mundo acad\u00e9mico, teniendo como referencia otros modelos sociales. Conocer otra realidad hace parte del intercambio cultural que realizar\u00eda a manera de un \u201cembajador\u201d: mostrarle a otras personas, que probablemente conozcan poco acerca de este pa\u00eds, los valores de nuestra sociedad. \nKiva ser\u00eda el apoyo que necesito para superar los primeros pasos de este largo camino y el impulso para poder realizar esta maestr\u00eda en el exterior, dado que gracias a Kiva podr\u00eda realizar los estudios que necesito para perfeccionar mi segundo idioma y poder aplicar a la Universidad que me permitir\u00e1 cumplir mi proyecto de vida. \n","en":"David is 30 years old and was born in Cali, in Valle del Cauca department in south-eastern Colombia. He is a single child and lives with his mother, his aunt and his cousin. His mother and his aunt are retired and his cousin works in Cali town hall on social projects. Despite the financial problems they had and thanks to the scholarships he received for academic excellence, David was able to graduate as a social commentator\/journalist from the Universidad del Valle.\r\n\r\nDavid's dream is to study a master's degree in screenplay at University College London. To do this, he needs Kiva's help, as this is the only way he can cover the cost of language exams and the university application process. One he has completed his master's degree and returned to Colombia, David wants to work making documentary films, in order to contribute to the country's development and show not only the situation in which Colombia finds itself, but also the possible solutions. \r\n\r\nHe recounts his story as follows, \"Despite the fact that my family are supporting me to achieve this dream, my parents are unable to cover costs as high as these due to their limited finances. I am currently part of a research group, and I work as a volunteer on a community action council. During the final years of my social communication and journalism degree, I worked at the Universidad del Valle film archive with the lecturer and producer Oscar Campo and the director Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, with whom I coordinated non-fiction programming. There, I presented, researched and published texts on the works submitted, which were mainly characterised by the crossroads generated between the social conditions of education, environment, and the documentary.\r\n\r\nThis experience motivated me to develop a documentary-essay called \u201ccon una gota empieza el aguacero\u201d [a downpour begins with a drop] for my dissertation, about conserving the basins which supply water to various cities in Colombia. I produced this in support of the Community Action Council of the hamlet of La Carolina-Corral de Piedra. This work won me the \"Beca Colombia Biodiversa\" scholarship from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alejandro \u00c1ngel Escobar foundation. Working in the film archive and participating in the creative documentary \u201cMirada de dos mundos\u201d [gaze from two worlds] diploma in 2008, led me to explore in more depth the representation of reality, through the use of new technologies, media and storytelling methods.\r\n\r\nBy studying a master's degree outside of Colombia, I will gain new cultural references. This change in perspective may help me to see not only the virtues and riches of Colombian society from another viewpoint, but also the problems that remain to be solved, and the possibilities to contribute to these solutions from the academic world, with other social models as a reference. Experiencing another reality forms part of the cultural exchange I will take part in as an \"ambassador\". I will show other people, who probably do not know much about this country, the values of our society. \r\n\r\nKiva will be the support I need to take the first steps on this long road, and the impetus to study this master's degree abroad, since thanks to Kiva, I will be able to undertake the studies I need to perfect my second language and apply to the university, so that I can achieve my life project."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1610226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to study a master's degree at University College London","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2014-06-02T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-02T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1755,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1775,"local_amount":1755,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650529946}],"funded_date":"2014-06-17T15:46:49Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":714011,"name":"Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santiago tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en el municipio de Solol\u00e1, departamento de Solol\u00e1, tiene 6 hijos; 4 hombres y 2 mujeres, se dedica a cultivar repollo, papa y cebolla, tambi\u00e9n compra verduras por cuerda y luego los lleva al mercado del municipio para vender, Santiago solicita un prestamos por un monto de Q. 11,000.00, para comprar semilla de repollo y semilla de papa e insumos, Santiago tiene planeado comprar un pick-up para usarlo en las labores agr\u00edcolas que realiza.","en":"Santiago is 39 and lives in the town of Solol\u00e1 in the department of Solol\u00e1.

They are grateful for the opportunities that have been given to the poor people who live in this area.  <br \/><br \/>Additional Information:  The members of this group live in the same area, which unfortunately is dangerous as a result of street crimes committed by young people.  Despite all of this, the members of this Communal Bank engage in integration and recreational sports activities to provide a distraction for children and young people.

She lives with her husband, who works at a private company and gets a fixed salary, approximately 400 GEL. Maia is temporarily unemployed, in spite of her high education, and this is the only source of income for their family.  The family belongs to the subsistence-poor category, as they have insufficient income for covering basic needs and everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nAccording to the above-mentioned situation, Maia lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require stable income and business experience. The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Maia to get a loan of 500 USD and start a trading business.

a positive and hardworking woman. She is married and has five children. She lives in a large rural village. Since childhood, Rafoat helped her parents looking after cattle and learnt this business. The circumstances were such that she was not able to get higher education due to her family's financial situation. Soon after finishing secondary school, Rafoat got married. Then she became a housewife. \r\n\r\nTogether with her husband, Rafoat tries to do everything possible in order to provide her children with everything necessary. In order to have a stable income for food, Rafoat and her husband started a business. They work with livestock breeding. She raises cattle, and then sells the meat and milk from them. Rafoat gets a good income form this business. Rafoat's husband also works as a local master carpenter and his work brings the family an additional income. Their overall income is enough for living at an average standard.

who is 41 years of age. She resides in a small house with her husband and two children in a rural village in Bargarh district in Odisha, India. For the last 12 years, Sapta has been running a general grocery shop in her small house with items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. She started the business with a small investment of her own. At that time, her monthly net income was around 3,000 INR. It was very difficult on her part to maintain the family. So she, along with eleven other women from her village, formed a self-help group named \"Jagannath SHG\" to access loans from People's Forum. \n\nAs per the statement of Sapta, she is currently earning 6,000 INR per month but this small income is not at all sufficient to manage the family along with educational expenses of her children, so she wants to increase her income by expanding her existing business. She plans to use the loan to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc. in bulk for her general store. This will help to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she will replenish her stock less frequently. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and enough savings so that she will be able to construct a house for her family, which is a dream for her, and give a better education to her son. The other members of the group are running milk selling, fruit and flower selling and vegetable vending businesses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1612077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, and potatoes in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Padampur, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-06-02T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-02T23:40:05Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalimba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sapta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tulabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sobhadra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surabhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kshiralata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subhadra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Motimayi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-05T13:47:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":714048,"name":"Bertha Katherine","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito Ciudadela Divino Ni\u00f1o se re\u00fane cada 15 d\u00edas en el barrio Divino Ni\u00f1o en la ciudad de Manta, ciudad conocida por sus hermosas playas que son muy visitadas en toda \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o y por ser una ciudad con una belleza sin igual con muchos atractivos tur\u00edsticos.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Bertha, tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen un hijo de 1 a\u00f1o.

woman, yet she is  a person of fortitude and strong spirit. In spite of her youth, she is already the loving mother of six and a devoted wife. Four of her children are now old enough to help her out in every way: in the household as well as with the livestock. Still, Aivazbiko does not neglect her children's  schooling and wishes them to grouw up educated. She herself  has received only secondary education as she was unable to go to college back in the day, having to earn money and help her parents from her school days on. This is why she would like her children to have the opportunities she did not have, since today all parents' duty is to ensure their children's education.\r\n\r\nAivazbiko has seven years of experience in raising livestock. At present she has one cow and three sheep. Her husband works in construction and also helps his wife in the livestock business. They have a small cow shed and also a big barn to which they bring the animals every day. Aivazbiko starts her work day at dawn and ends at dusk since she has a large land plot, and spring is the planting season. And thus this fragile woman works extremely hard, helping her husband support the family and ensuring the well-being of her children.\r\nAivazbiko never took out any loans before.  This is the first time she felt comfortable reaching out to Arvand and applying for a loan. She would like to use this money to buy a calf and animal feed. She really hopes to obtain support and thanks Kiva for its help in advance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1610991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Her husband works as a taxi driver and she is involved in her own business, working as a fruit vendor. She has a small shop at the local market.  Dilbar has been able to gradually develop her business.  She started 10 years ago with a small working capital.  In the beginning, things were very difficult because the competition was fierce.  However, thanks to her hard work and patience, she managed to develop her business.  She now wants to increase her working capital, because everyone buys more fruits in the summer season.  She is taking a loan of 5,000 somoni to buy various fruits in order to increase her working capital.

He is married and has a few adult children who all have their own families.  Mir lives with his wife in a small house in the countryside.  In spite of his age, he is full of energy and of the desire to work for his family.  He works as a farmer and cattle breeder, and owns his own plot of land.  Eight hectares of his land are rain-fed and a smaller portion consists of irrigated land.  Mir grows crops on his land, and his wife helps him by raising and taking care of the livestock.\r\n\r\nSince Mir and his wife own a large plot of land, they use it as pasture for their livestock.  They make a good income from their animal husbandry business, and this is the reason why Mir wants to expand his business and increase his livestock headcount.  He currently wants to buy a few head of cattle, but he doesn't have enough money to do so.  He has therefore turned to MDO Arvand to receive a loan and buy some livestock.  Mir thanks Arvand in advance for all their

This farmer has not skipped a day of planting corn for 55 years.  \r\n\r\nHe started helping his dad to cultivate pumpkin seeds, squash and, of course, corn. Little by little, he became independent and 25 years later, thanks to his own hard work and the help of his six grown-up children, he got his own land and irrigation engines so he did not have to stop working in dry seasons.\r\n\r\nRamon did not go to school because of a lack of economic resources, but he was able to get along. Now he gives work to people who want to get ahead as well.  He can also support his family with the income from the produce together with a small amount of money from his daughter who lives in the United States. \r\n\r\nHowever, he now needs to take advantage of the winter, but does not have enough money to carry out his work as well as he wants.  Therefore he needs a loan to buy fertilizer for the corn crops so he can offer a high quality product. \r\n\r\nAmong his other plans, he would like to take out another loan to branch out into the rearing of pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1610321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for his corn crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-06-03T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-03T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":194,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530082128},{"amount":100,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542563217}],"funded_date":"2014-06-03T15:00:08Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T15:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":714086,"name":"Ku\u00f1a Pyapy Mbarete Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ku\u00f1a Pyapy Mbarete se form\u00f3 en la ciudad de Curuguaty, una ciudad lejana de la zona aun en crecimiento donde muchas de las integrantes hacen actividades eminentemente rurales.\nLa Sra.

She studied teaching and works mornings as a teacher in a school. Three years ago, she decided to work afternoons offering academic reinforcement, and little by little she organized her clientele. She teaches the children in her own house, which is set up with  tables and chairs  so that they can be comfortable while doing their homework that has been assigned in school.

Since he was very young, Joel has liked to play on the Play Station. For this reason, he took advantage of his skills and aptitudes in order to serve other people while generating income.

This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is connected to or just inside their house. A variety store is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP 5's worth of cooking oil, or an egg.

Her regular customers are her neighbors, people passing by and the people in the community. She earns PHP 300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a loan of PHP 35,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help, as it will allow her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to have more customers and that her business will continue to expand. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

for those in the Marines and the Navy.  These wooden paddles are wrapped with various colored cords and engraved with custom emblems to make the perfect award or retirement gift for those in the military.  These meaningful mementos were such huge hits that Anthony decided to turn his art of paddle-making into a business. \r\n\r\nAnthony's business is one of the few commemorative military paddle-makers in the world. Anthony treats his creations as unique works of art, taking time and patience to ensure his customers are truly receiving a one-of-a-kind gift. He currently makes everything himself, taking pride in his carefully detailed craftsmanship.  \r\n\r\nRecently, Anthony received a proposal letter from a local military base asking him to come in and become a permanent vendor on base, which is a huge opportunity for this budding entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nAnthony will use his $3,500 Kiva loan to build out his new shop and purchase new equipment, including a laser engraver and other miscellaneous tools to create even more specialty products for his customers on base.\r\n\r\nAnthony has high hopes for his business and believes he has found the perfect niche for his talents.  He is excited about this new opportunity, and believes it is exactly what he needs to bring his business to the next level.\r\n\r\nVisit Anthony\u2019s website and check out some of his creations at:

She has been doing embroidery with a machine at home for the past few years to support her family. Her husband is also doing the same work at home, but earns insufficient income to support family. So she helps him in his tasks related to the embroidery; she sells embroidered dresses in her town. By this time, she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income. She has become expert in embroidery with a machine, and wants more raw materials for embroidery so that she can easily cope with the increasing demands. This is the reason Asma has requested a Kiva loan through BRAC Pakistan, which is an active field partner of Kiva. She will buy embroidery materials such as pearls, sequins, various color threads etc. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of two sons and two daughters. She hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her large sales. She wishes to utilize a portion of the revenue to provide a quality education for her children.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Her husband has been running a general store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits, etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store as well. Some of his relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up a very good relationship with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town and that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relationships, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Asma requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stocks of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc. Asma hopes that her husband will utilize the loan in a positive way; this amount will help him to cope with the demand of her family. Asma thanks Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan.

Now the rickshaw body needs to be replaced because it rattles during driving. This is the reason he wants to buy a new body for his Moto Rickshaw.

He is the only one responsible for feeding the entire family and managing the household.\r\n\r\nHe needs to purchase different types of clothes in bulk for reselling, but due to insufficient financial means he is unable to purchase these clothes. Therefore Sobia is applying for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can assist her husband in purchasing these clothes in bulk for his business. He can also increase the size of his business and earn maximum profit with the help of this loan amount. \r\n\r\nSobia is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

His relatives like to purchase items from his general store. He speaks with a monotonous tone which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town.
