He is married and has three children. Jamshed only has secondary education, and it worked out that he decided not to work at some office, but rather to be involved in his own business and earn a living independently. He is involved in an extraordinary business. This business is livestock slaughter and meat sales. He has been running this business for several years and earns a good income from it.\r\n\r\nJamshed sells beef and lamb at a market and leases a butcher shop. He also sells beef and lamb fat, and also wool from the slaughtered livestock to leather processors. Jamshed buys livestock for slaughter every week and sells the meat. He already has regular clients - people buy meat for consumption and also for food preparation at cafes. Now Jamshed needs to buy several heads of livestock for slaughter and subsequent sale, and this is why he came to Arvand for a loan. He thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1602260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-06-03T18:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-03T18:10:15Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamshed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":361.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":363.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":393.09},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":395.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":426.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":431.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":444.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":465.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":480.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":529.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.14},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":717749,"name":"Rukhsana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukhsana, age 38, is a married woman.

It is made up of women who all live in the same village. They share values of solidarity and mutual aid, which characterize their actions and the relationships between group members.\r\n\r\nThe Banc Villageois is starting its twelfth loan cycle, which means the women have a good experience in retail, their main business.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ramata (shown again in the inset on the top right of the photograph) is the group's featured borrower. She dedicates herself to selling vegetables, more precisely eggplants and chili pepper. After each round, these businesses generate a net profit of XOF 25'000 and 7'000, respectively.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, she intends to buy XOF 185'000 worth of eggplants, exclusively from producers. She will resell them at the international market of her subregion.\r\n\r\nShe will use her profit in part to take a significant role in covering daily expenses (food and school supplies) during her children's studies, and in part to build up her

She attended college and is now a retired nurse.  She is now single after having separated from her spouse at a young age.  She has two children of whom one lives with her, and the other is married.  Rosa is currently a pensioned nurse, having met the legally required years of work.  Since she was a young girl, she dreamed of being a nurse, and thanks to God and her parents, she was able to make that a reality.

He knew that she had experience as she had once run a business in the local market. Today, after seven years dedicating herself to breathing life into the refreshment stand and sale of fast food, she has achieved good results and much encouragement to continue growing.\r\n\r\nThe main items she offers are natural juices, stuffed potatoes, hamburgers, empanadas, hot dogs and other fast food which she sells for cash every day from 2 in the afternoon to 10 at night. Her principal customers are her neighbours from the community where she lives and has her business.\r\n\r\nNadia's goal is to support her daughter through higher education, and then later on buy an apartment. With dreams like these she wakes up every day ready to work to achieve them. She is currently seeking a loan from Kiva to buy natural juices, stuffed potatoes, empanadas, hot dogs, hamburgers and sauces so she can prepare her daily dishes. In this way she will increase sales and turn her loan into a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1611081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy natural juices, stuffed potatoes, empanadas, hot dogs, hamburgers and sauces","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-06-03T19:10:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-03T19:10:41Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naida De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":106772},{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":109975},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":113274},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":116673},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":120173},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":123778},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":127491},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":131316},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":135256},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":139313},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":143493},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":147797},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":152231},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":156798},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":161502},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166347},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":171338},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":176473}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":717807,"name":"Sally","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello world!!!

She is the mother of four children. Her husband owns an ice cream shop in the market. Nowadays, as summer season has started in Pakistan, his customers demand more ice cream. To cope with demand of his customers, he purchases basic raw ingredients for ice cream such as cream, condensed milk, butterfat, sugar, flavorings, fruit purees and extracts, cocoa powder, nuts, cookie pieces, and cookie dough. He wants to purchase an ice cream making machine for the business but does not have sufficient funds to cover the cost of a machine. Therefore, Ruqiya requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to buy an ice cream machine for his shop. She hopes that lenders will support him and this loan will prove productive for her husband's business as well. Ruqiya is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

Her husband owns a small clothing shop in which he sells ladies and gentleman\u2019s clothes. He has been running this business for many years and cherishing his whole family. It is his misfortune that he could not build up a good relationship among his customers; this is the reason he could not establish his enterprise. \r\n\r\nNow with the increase in their needs they consider it necessary to grow the business also. But the lack of capital is the major problem for her husband. Therefore, Naseem took a loan for her husband\u2019s business. With the help of this loan her husband will purchase more clothes to sell. \r\n\r\nNaseem thanks to Kiva and field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

He is married to Yolanda, a seamstress and a mother to their child. By the grace of God, Remegio has managed to support his child's schooling until college. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRemegio oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Their regular passengers and customers are from the local community. He earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in boundary every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new tires for the jeepney and to renew his registration. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.\r\n\r\nRemegio dreams of seeing his grandchildren grow up as he grows old and hopes that his transportation business will last longer. He meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn. They modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

By purchasing this additional stock, it will help with expanding his business and profit.

Her earnings were a big help in their personal, household, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another PHP 10,000 loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nErlinda hopes to buy another unit of jeepney and dreams of healthy and happy living for her family. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money and they modified the jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

He is requesting a loan for a maize mill to provide a maize milling service to over 300 families in his community.\n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most rural families in Kapiri Mposhi District grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima. Clever is already a well-respected member in his community and wants to expand his business to offer this maize milling service. \n\nRent-to-Own has done market research in Clever\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest maize mill is over 10 km away, but is often broken down. This means most potential customers have to travel to other villages, and since most will walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. \n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many enterprising farmers and shop owners such as Clever, as it allows for him to diversify his business. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill are very prohibitive. Once he secures a loan, Clever will be able to get a maize mill from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nThis loan

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The only apparent problem in this business activity is the pest infestation that attacks this product when not cared for and the \u2018roya\u2019 [coffee rust].  The competition is not a problem, and each producer has their customers.  Her own market is an area that is well-known for coffee production.\r\n\r\nDilicia is now requesting financial support from the different Kiva lenders.  This is so that she will be able to buy supplies and the other products that help protect her crops.  During this season it is the flowering of the plants and the rains that make it the best time to be able to water and fertilize.\r\n\r\nDilcia\u2019s plans for the future are to continue improving her coffee crops by expanding her property and to plant new pants.  This will bring an increase in the profits and improve the future for her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1610969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to take care of her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-06-04T02:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-04T02:00:10Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilcia Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":13370,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611762696}],"funded_date":"2014-06-05T01:38:44Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":717895,"name":"Pelagie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pelagie is age 48.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

He initially bought clothing, which he resold at the market in a nearby village.  He later bought a large quantity of shoes, which unfortunately didn't work very well.  He had to sell his merchandise at a low price, just to recuperate his investment.  This is how, by trial and error, he finally found the right merchandise to sell and the customers to sell it to.  \r\n\r\nAlexander now works as an itinerant retailer, selling mostly women and men's  leather shoes.  He sells his merchandise in several small villages as well as in his own town, in front of the train station.  \r\n\r\nAlexander wants to continue to develop his own business.

She is a widow and the mother of three children, aged 24 to 27, with whom she lives.\r\n \r\nFour years ago, a friend of Mabis, who was trading goods coming from a region bordering Colombia, proposed that she start dealing in clothing. Thus, Mabis began and today she has great dreams, such as that of owning a store so that she can buy her own house in the future. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenges are to increase her sales, in addition to fostering  loyalty among her customer and saving.  In order to achieve these goals, Mabis gets up every day and starts working from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening. She sells on credit to most of her customers, who are neighbors and referrals.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first funding from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, so that she can buy clothing, such as jeans, skirts, shirts, blouses and pants. Her plans are to increase sales and profits, thereby making a successful investment with her Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1611107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing such as jeans, skirts, shirts, blouses and pants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-06-04T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-04T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":64.27,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mabis De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":54035},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":75606},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77874},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80210},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":82617},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85095},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":87648},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":90278},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":92986},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95775},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98649},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":129227}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.3,"local_amount":54035,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":54222.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542773},{"amount":39.6,"local_amount":75606,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75868.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026018},{"amount":40.79,"local_amount":77874,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":78143.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518203},{"amount":41,"local_amount":80210,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":80488.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.02,"payment_id":562430839},{"amount":37.93,"local_amount":82617,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":82903.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.35,"payment_id":579566580},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":85095,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":85389.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.94,"payment_id":611789016},{"amount":36.26,"local_amount":87648,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87951.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.65,"payment_id":624849214},{"amount":223.22,"local_amount":506915,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":508672.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":42.31,"payment_id":636603308}],"funded_date":"2014-07-04T04:39:12Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":714782,"name":"Carlota","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Carlota se dedica al negocio de tienda de abarrotes, la socia vende productos de primera necesidad como arroz, azucar, leche y galletas, la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m, la socia ya tiene 5 a\u00f1os en este negocio y le va muy bien, el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el negocio de tienda de abarrotes.

It consists of five women. They all live in traditional and simple families in Sana'a, Yemen. They know one another through friendship and neighborhood connections. They applied for a loan of 220,000 YER from AMB. <br \/><br \/>Zynab is a 47-year-old widow living with her children in their own house. She is the leader of the group. She works as a housewife, and her husband passed away several years ago. He was the sole breadwinner of the family, and recently the oldest child became the breadwinner of the family. He is an employee in the private sector. Zynab and her husband had purchased a piece of land and built their house on it. This cost them a lot of money, and unfortunately, they couldn't purchase windows for the rooms, kitchen and bathroom.

They hang the clothes on the windows and this negatively affects the house organization, which makes Wajida feel ashamed, especially when she meets visitors inside the house.

\u201cFriendship San Juan\u201d are true fighters. Maria, a 41-year-old single mother with six years of education, is an example. She has one teenage son and has begun her university studies. She is a happy and enthusiastic woman and works hard to help her son make his dreams come true. Maria has a textile business and creates fine scarves, shawls and backpacks. She sells these items at a wholesale price by the dozen to merchants in nearby stores. She is requesting her third loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase additional thread and supplies for her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is the President of the Trust Bank which is a perfect position for her. She has great leadership skills and transmits confidence and security to the group. Maria clearly exemplifies how one determined woman can break the cycle of poverty with the necessary tools and create a more prosperous life for herself and her son. She is determined that her son have a more prosperous life and realizes that education is essential.\r\n\r\nFriendship Bridge combines small loans and participatory non-formal educational seminars in the monthly meetings of each Trust Bank. This is called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.  A Loan Officer of the organization shares information on practical subjects like money management, budgeting and accounting as well as indebtedness and customer service.

Encarnaci\u00f3n also has a stall in the local market where she sells baby clothes and undergarments for women. Recently, she began another business and sells \u201cceviche\u201d which is a marinated fish cocktail. This is her own delicious recipe and her customers love to buy it from her. Encarnaci\u00f3n is requesting a new loan that she will use to buy more utensils and other supplies in order to improve her businesses.\r\n\r\nAll of the ladies of the Trust Bank benefit from the monthly educational seminars given by a Loan Officer of Friendship Bridge. They can immediately use relevant information about business administration, budgeting and accounting as well as customer service and indebtedness. Other topics covered include health and medicinal plants, women\u2019s rights and self esteem and healthy habits. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the loans and non-formal education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. It is a valuable combination that really works for the over 20,000 women clients of the organization!\r\n\r\nEncarnaci\u00f3n and the six other women in her Trust Bank want Kiva investors to know how much they appreciate being able to secure these small loans. They work hard to manage their businesses successfully and are determined to pay back the loans fully and on time. Thank you, Kiva investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1615956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They all live in extended traditional families in the city of BLA, region of SEGOU (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nThey know one another through ties of kinship, and their income-generating activity consists in buying and selling condiments and various goods. This is their 3rd group loan cycle. Both past loans were correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nNENE (1st from the left in the photo) plans to use her loan to buy 20 boxes of pomade and 5 cartons of soap. She buys her stock from local wholesalers. She sells for cash, though often on credit, to a clientele that consists of both men and women. \r\n\r\nShe expects to earn an average monthly profit of 11,000 FCFA, which she will use to pay for tuition and food.

The oldest works in a private business, the next two are students in different grades in secondary school, and the youngest is also a student, in primary school. With 6 years of education and a lot of life experience, she has worked in business, and works as a cook making natural juices that she puts in plastic bottles to sell, among other activities that have been the means of income for her family. At the moment, she works selling food in a small business strategically located in the center of the city and previously she sold sandals for men and women of all ages, but due to the economic situation, her sales went down and she decided it would be better to change businesses. As previously mentioned, she works making juices which she bottles and sells in various convenience stores, grocery stores and other businesses in the area which support her and open doors for her to get ahead. She uses a taxi to get from her home to the business and to sell the product she uses a small vendor's cart. COMIXMUL, in a number of occasions, has helped her with the various businesses that she has had since she is a fighter who deserves the best in her life.  This time, the loan officer that met with her discussed the Kiva funds which are a big help in the products that COMIXMUL promotes, especially for health, since she suffers from a gallbladder problem which she wants to treat before it becomes worse and affects her health more. This is why she is asking to be helped by the investors to be able to have the treatment and the surgery to cure her.  Her goals are to be able to go ahead with the necessary treatment and then to continue working in her small business because with the different training that she has gotten from the FUDEIMFA trainers, she has learned how to grow and has managed to get ahead and in this way she won't neglect her customers and leave them unsatisfied.

Zaskia is six years old and attends kindergarten, and the two younger ones are Zidan, age four, and Samil, age two.\r\n\r\nRaymond's parents recently offered Zita a vacant spot in a business building, and she took the opportunity to expand her kiosk business into that spot. Having a permanent trading area for her business has enabled her to earn more income for the family's daily needs.  \r\n\r\nZita needs to buy more inventory items to sell in her storefront. Unfortunately, she does not have enough money immediately available to make this purchase. She has therefore applied for a loan from TLM in the amount of IDR 4,500,000. The loan funds will be used to buy more football uniforms, shoes, football jackets, and socks to offer for sale.

Kamenka-Dneprovskaya for more than 20 years. He has five large, heated greenhouses and another plot close by with two greenhouses that do not have heating. He grows tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbage, and peppers and has regular customers who make wholesale purchases at good prices. Andrei plans to demolish one small greenhouse because it takes up too much space and prevents adding an extension to two large greenhouses. Then he will need to install heating.
