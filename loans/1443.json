In his business he works in repair and maintenance of trucks and other vehicles. His business idea began 10 years ago when he noticed that in the area where he lives there were a significant number of heavy machinery trucks and various vehicles used for the transport of cargo and construction materials. These vehicles were located at his mother\u00b4s place which he used to park the cars to do his maintenance jobs. Little by little he got involved. He posted an advertisement, set up his own shop at his mother\u00b4s place, and started repairing vehicles such as dump trucks, heavy trucks, etc.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to make changes to the place, to cover it to protect the vehicles and people from rain, since his dream and big challenge is educating his children professionally, and his business is the only income generator for the household. Currently Carlos is applying for a credikiva.

Her dream is to have a big salon with modern equipment.  \r\n\r\nMalati belongs to a Self-Help Group called \u201cSagarika\u201d which is undertaken by the local NGO \u201cSabuj Sangh\u201d. The other three members will use their portion for poultry farming, vegetable cultivation and for paddy (rice) cultivation. Malati is the featured borrower of this group. This loan will help all of them in securing a better life and giving good education to their children.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1614874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy equipment for the salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"South 24 Parganas, West Bengal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-06-05T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-05T02:10:06Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malati     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shailabala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":718385,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda owns and operates a motorcycle transport business to make a living.

She also sells Avon products in an itinerant manner to the neighbors in her community.  A friend encouraged and motivated her to do so.  Dora has two children.  They live with her, and both of them go to the community school.  \r\n\r\nShe does the field work like clearing the field, applying fertilizer, and collecting the harvest, among others, with her husband.  They do this on the week-ends because her husband works as a security guard for a private company.  This way she contributes more income to the household.  Contributions to the household income come from the coffee production at the end of the year and the sale of Avon products.  The land that they work is their own, and it is close to their house.  \r\n\r\nShe dreams of seeing her children become professionals with established and solid households.  She also dreams of being able to see her coffee crops expanded.  She would buy more land and plant a variety of coffee that is attractive to her customers with a good price in the market.  This way she would generate income for her family and strengthen the household finances.  Her objective is for her children to inherit the land that she and her husband now work.\r\n\r\nTherefore she is now requesting a loan to buy leaf fertilizer and 18-46-0 fertilizer, among others.  These products will help her coffee harvest to be better cared for and protected from pests, diseases, and climate changes such as ice on the beans.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1611761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to care for and protect her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"marcala, la paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-06-05T15:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-05T15:10:13Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":718451,"name":"Anjani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anjani is 21 years old, a young entrepreneur who has studied till eighth grade.

Her family helps in her farming activities. She is married. In her youth, she had the opportunity of studying up to secondary school, having completed her 1st 3 years of the common cycle. Dilma is the mother of 4 children who study in the community school in different grades. Upon completing school activities, they too work in the fields alongside their parents.\r\n\r\nDilma has been involved in these activities for some 10 years, since it was her parents who taught her to farm, and she still works the fields with her husband.

It is also the name of the language that is spoken by these proud people. Seven women have formed a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank with this name. They are from the peaceful village of San Juan La Laguna, one of the many small towns that dot Lake Atitlan. Because tourism is increasing in this picturesque area, the women of the Trust Bank create and sell traditional weavings, many of which are dyed using seeds, leaves, charcoal, the bark of trees and the juice of fruits like pomegranates. \r\n\r\nThese strong-willed women are motivated to create more prosperous lives for themselves and their families. Maria is a 31-year-old single mother, and a prime example of someone who eagerly seeks the tools to elevate herself and her son. Because she grew up in extreme poverty, Maria had little access to formal education. She is seeking her first loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase supplies for dyeing, needles, and thread for her textile business. Maria creates colorful purses, curtains and bedspreads.\r\n\r\nFriendship Bridge not only provides loans to over 20,000 clients, but also incorporates education in the monthly meetings of each Trust Bank. A Loan Officer shares relevant and beneficial information on timely subjects like children\u2019s education and nutrition, effective business management including budgeting, accounting and customer service. Other topics covered include self-esteem and women\u2019s rights as well as medicinal plants and health. It is the combination of the loans and education that makes the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge such a wonderful vehicle for these impoverished women to leave poverty behind.\r\nKIVA investors are valuable collaborators with Friendship Bridge and are greatly appreciated. Maria and the six ladies in the \u201cTzutuhil\u201d Trust Bank are poised to face a brighter, happier and more prosperous tomorrow because of their small loans and education.

The place where he works is one kilometer from his house.\r\n\r\nHe will invest the requested loan in buying an irrigation system, which he will install so that the crops don't suffer when it doesn't rain. He will have the option to water them, and so he will be making sure that he will be able to take advantage of his investment and make sure his wife has food, because he \r\nwill have basic grains. \r\n\r\nHis biggest dream is to have his pumping equipment available so that he can grow other vegetables and so his family can eat healthy vegetables.

Her entrepreneurial spirit led her to learn sewing with an older sister and she improved after taking some classes. She has 7 years of experience making garments, starting with very simple garments up to her strongpoint which is making pajamas for ladies and children as well as outfits of shorts and blouses for children.\r\n\r\nThanks to this work she is able to afford her daughters\u00b4 education expenses, which is what represents her salary. She began her business venture with her own money, but needs to strengthen her machinery and equipment which is why she will invest her funding in the purchase of 2 industrial sewing machines.

It consists of five women, who are all hardworking. They live in Aden, Yemen. They have taken out a loan of 350,000 YER. Faizah is a 28-year-old married woman with three children. Her oldest child is 6 years old, and the youngest is two years old. She studied until elementary school, but she couldn't complete her studies. She is very active, a dynamic woman. She has a strong determination to take care of her children. Her husband is the sole breadwinner for the family. Recently, he has been unable to look after the family. Faizah decided to help him to cover the  family expenses. She started out with a small amount of money which she saved up herself. Faiza invested that money in her own business. She started that business two years ago, selling ready-made women\u2019s clothes in order to provide for the family. She sees this business as profitable for her. Faiza is very grateful and thankful for Kiva's lenders for her first loan. That loan helped her to improve her business. For further expansion, Faiza has applied for a second loan, of 80,000 YER, from AMB, in order to buy more ready-made women\u2019s clothes to resell them to the women in her area. Faiza looks forward to expanding her business by opening a large store to sell ready-made clothes. She hopes to provide her children with a secure future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1609785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase more ready- made women's clothes and resell them to the women in her area.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Aden","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-06-05T22:50:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-05T22:50:23Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faizh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lua`a","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35180},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":34980},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":34980}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.91},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":165.85,"local_amount":35180,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":35644.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517446163},{"amount":164.91,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529930091},{"amount":164.91,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542422441},{"amount":164.91,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561560061},{"amount":164.91,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579469140},{"amount":164.91,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595075963},{"amount":164.9,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610478493},{"amount":164.9,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624780995},{"amount":164.9,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636139709},{"amount":164.9,"local_amount":34980,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":35442.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752006658}],"funded_date":"2014-06-20T01:32:54Z","paid_date":"2015-12-01T13:12:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":718688,"name":"Nila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nila, age 41, is happy tending her little store.

He was born in El Carmen in the province of  Obispo Santisteban and now lives with his uncle in the community of Montero in Santa Cruz Department of Bolivia. He works as a municipal inspector for the municipal government of Montero. Reinaldo always liked numbers a lot and everything to do with finance. He also feels that the financial world grows in large steps every day. Plus it is a field with good employment opportunities. <br \/><br \/>So he decided to study to become a Public accountant. With a lot of sacrifice due to the distance of the university from his house, he has managed to finish the years of study with only a little bit left to complete his studies. His main obstacle is financial. Besides paying for his expenses he needs to help his parents financially as they live in the country and do not have much income. <br \/><br \/>For this reason Reinaldo is requesting an educational loan to finance his studies and complete his degree. He is certain that with this opportunity he will be able to achieve the first of his dreams. Another of his dreams is to work in the financial section of a petroleum company and create his own business offering accounting services. Reinaldo tells us that he is very happy and grateful to know that there are people who are willing to help others and encourage them at the same time to not accept mediocrity but grow their personal and professional desires each day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1611902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

","en":"Mukimjon is 43 years old. He is married and has two grown children. He sells confectionery items. His wife also helps him sell at the market. Recently Mukimjon started a home remodeling project. Most importantly, he would like to insulate his roof so as to  retain  heat in winter. This year has been very hard for them since their current roof is leaking and needs to be repaired. It was very cold. Not long ago Mukimjon learned from his friends that it is possible to obtain \"green loans\" from Arvand for home repairs and construction. He plans to install a double layers of panels made of wood and other materials that do not pose a health risk. \r\n\r\nIn this way he will eliminate the current loss of heat through his non-insulated  roof, and thus consume less energy for heating the house. Mukimjon has consulted master builders, and this option is considered the most practical choice  as well as free from health hazards. Mukimjon is very mindful of his family's health. He was very glad to obtain this opportunity to insulate his roof and house. His wife was also very glad to hear these news. They decided to apply for this loan and carry out the long-awaited repairs, which is why they turned to Arvand. They are not able to save a lot for the construction work since their children are already grown, and there are more and more obligations to meet every year. The Arvand loan comes in very handy. Mukimjon and his family really hope to receive support from Arvand and realize their plans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1613449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

They applied for a loan of 80,000 Yemeni rial (YER) from Al-Amal Microfinance Bank.\r\n\r\nMona is a hardworking woman. She is a 28-year-old married woman and lives in a rented house in a poor area. She is the leader of the group. Mona has started her business of selling accessories and cosmetics door-to-door three years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter her husband immigrated to Saudi Arabia, Mona assumed the responsibility of her family. She started her business with a small capital. Year by year her business improves more, but most of what she earns from profits go to the expenses of the family. She has good experience in her business. \r\n\r\nThanks to her experiences, Mona deals with her own business with ease. Unfortunately, the income of this business is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family, and she wants to improve her business. For this reason, she applied for a loan of 20,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more cosmetics and accessories to resell to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe looks forward to expanding her business more through opening a small shop for selling accessories and cosmetics.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1617094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase more cosmetics and accessories to resale for her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"hodeidah","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-06-06T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-06T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saeda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Razki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517446209},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529930137},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542422487},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561560104},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579469199},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595076008},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610478536},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":8060.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624781040},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":12090.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636139746},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4030.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650499148}],"funded_date":"2014-06-16T19:20:27Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:11:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosalee Kiely","image":null}},{"id":718905,"name":"Merla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merla is married and has three children.
