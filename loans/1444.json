His parents split up several years ago and as he has never lived with his father so he gets no support from him.  His mother is the only person who looks after the family. She lives in Potosi and works in a cake shop so that she can provide for the household.  From time to time she sends him money.\r\n\r\nDiego started working three years ago to contribute to the expenses at his aunt's house.  To do this he had to give up studying at university. However, when he found out about the programme which made it possible to carry on with studies, he found the motivation to go back to university and take up his course again.  To do this he had to choose a timetable which allows him to work and then study in the evening.  \r\n\r\nFor Diego, it is very important to finish university and be an example to his younger cousins who he lives with.  He can also help them financially. But above all, his dream is the same as his mother's: to see her three children working as professional people. Diego tells us that his dream is to be one of the best and to get a steady job. \r\n\r\nHe is grateful to the people who give financial help to young people and generate new opportunities for them to study.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1611914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Some families don\u2019t have their own computers, so they go to computer shops to encode and print documents. Others rent to connect with their loved ones abroad; and others, especially the children and the youth, rent to play games. Normally, computer shops open at 8am and close at 7pm. Her regular customers are the children and youth of their community. She earns 400 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nJust as any other business owner, she is also hoping that her shop will continue to expand and have more customers and branches. She meets every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1617284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional computer parts and supplies needed in her business.

Fatima says that her house lacks of a refrigerator and she can't afford this thing. Inside the kitchen of her house, Fatima puts many kinds of drinks, foods, sweets, and vegetables without a refrigerator where they need to be in a cold condition. The climate these days is very hot. Unfortunately, she doesn't have a refrigerator in order to keep all those foods and drinks in a cold condition. As a result, most of those foods and drinks expire quickly. For this reason Fatima is requesting a loan of 50,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase a refrigerator for the house.\r\n\r\nFatima looks forward to improving the condition of her family through purchasing all home appliances in order to make her house more comfortable. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1617374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase a refrigerator for the house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-06-06T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-06T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohsana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Somaia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517446219},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529930146},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542422497},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561560113},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579469209},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595076018},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610478544},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624781048},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636139755},{"amount":95,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20418.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650499155}],"funded_date":"2014-06-23T02:44:38Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:11:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":719037,"name":"Melisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melisa is 50 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising livestock in the Philippines.

They both manage their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nLuciliza maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. \r\n\r\nLuciliza hopes that her business will continue to grow and expand and she dreams of giving her family a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1617437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Disaster recovery"],"use":" To pay for additional merchandise like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pontevedra, Capiz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-06-06T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-06T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luciliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1919.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504229844},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1919,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517516928},{"amount":87.52,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3838.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529999890},{"amount":174.96,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7675.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696523796}],"funded_date":"2014-06-25T13:19:47Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":719082,"name":"Milutin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milutin is a married father of a 4-year-old son.

He was not able to continue because at that time the school was too far away, and his economic situation was not very good. He has four children, of whom three are in school, while the other one is still little and not yet of school age. Only his wife and children are dependent on him. \r\n\r\nJuan and his family have operated a mill for 28 years, and that is where he works. He decided to start this business because he lives in a densely populated area, and he saw the need for a mill among the inhabitants. Now he works there together with his wife. His schedule for milling is divided into two periods each day: from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan he is requesting to buy some belts for the mill, which are needed because the old ones are worn out. He will also buy 9 discs for the mill. The loan will be very helpful for him, since his mill will operate more effectively and he will be able to provide better service to his customers. \r\n\r\nHis dream for the future is to have life to continue working and keep providing services to people.

Tingzanieng is the featured profile member pictured with her hand raised. Devoid of continuous access to grid-based power, the family depends on alternative lighting devices like kerosene lamps, candles, petromax, etc. to light the home for a significant period of time after dark every day. Tingzanieng is forced to divert a considerable share of their means towards the purchase of these alternative lighting sources as  they demand expensive fuel. Besides, the lamps are putting the health of the family members at risk as they emit lethal gases while burning kerosene. \r\n\r\nSince a solar lighting system is powered by the sun\u2019s renewable energy; the system is energy neutral and an absolutely clean source of illumination. Therefore, Tingzanieng and the rest of the group members want to purchase solar lighting devices which are a cleaner alternative.

They all live in a small village on the outskirts of Churachandpur in Manipur State, which is in the northeastern part of India. They came together as a group to take a loan to create income activities for themselves and for the family. Nengkhovah is the group leader pictured with her hand raised. She is 46 years old and is the mother of two daughters and one son. She lives with five members as a family. Her husband's main line of income is construction work. However, his source of income is unreliable because he works on a temporary basis only when there is a requirement. Therefore, in order to supplement the family's income, Nengkhovah usually weaves traditional garments but could not produce much due to limited capital at her disposal. She initiated and formed the group to fulfill the capital needs for her weaving income activities. She started weaving four days a week and was able to produce six traditional wrap-around skirts of different quality and four shawls in a month and a week\u2019s time. With the profits, she was able to buy yarn to continue weaving and with the little savings she has made from her profits, she managed to support her children's education better. She was able to pay the children's school fees on time. She is happy that her children could continue their studies. The oldest son is in secondary and the younger daughters are in high school. She is very happy with all the support that she gets from her husband as well as her children. Her children did well by bringing home their friends to buy the traditional garments that their mother weaves. In this way, people know where to buy when they need one. Now, she needs a loan to buy solar home lighting to continue with her weaving business and to increase her productivity. She needed a solar home lighting system because after sunset, she could not continue weaving due to irregular electric supply in the village.\r\n\r\nTherefore, with the assistance of a Kiva loan, she wanted to buy a solar home lighting system for her family and to weave longer hours at night. Since this solar home lighting comes with 45 watts, which can light four bulbs for 12 hrs a day. she will be able to make more income than usual and will help her manage to save. She takes pride in her job and is satisfied because she can also take care of her household chores and manage the family affairs. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members also need a solar loan for their respective activities and for their children\u2019s study purpose. The group members' activities can be classified as weaving, tailoring and grocery store.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1617440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-06-06T23:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-06T23:20:19Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chingkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemtinlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":146076,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":146076}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-11T00:03:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":714958,"name":"Flamboyan I Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flamboyan I group successfully completed their second cycle with a loan from Kiva and the group is running smoothly and well.

They mostly live in traditional families in Ouorofoura, a village in the Dogoni commune, in Sikasso, the third administrative region of Mali. They are working with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to better carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. The group is on their seventh loan, and their previous loans have all been repaid correctly.\r\n\r\nFatoumata, seated second from the right in the photo, grows groundnuts. With this loan, she plans to buy a 50-kilogram sac of fertilizer and one drum of herbicide. She will also pay the cost of labor to farm a half hectare field.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest, crops will be sold in the village and at a Sikasso market to male and female customers for cash and credit. Fatoumata hopes to earn an average profit of 75,000 francs CFA per harvest. These earnings will allow her to pay back a part of the loan and its interest as well as help her husband support their family's everyday expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1609582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, seeds, and farm inputs, and to pay the cost of labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouorofoura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-06T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-06T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":95.23,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assetou                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumatou                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Siaka                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Mama                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matogoma                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":320000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":320000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":579.77,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":325117.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":95.23,"payment_id":636515256}],"funded_date":"2014-06-10T16:26:36Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lindsay","image":839627}},{"id":719151,"name":"Shareef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shareef is a 28-year-old single man from Rafah City.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines fight off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

His father was the one who ensured that he would learn to be a good man. He also works as a mason and he learned observing when he was a mason's apprentice. The distance he travels varies since he works two plots and doesn't always go to the same place. When he reaps the harvest, he sells one part and the rest is for consumption. No one else is involved in this activity. He does the work in the morning from 6:00 am to 12:00 noon.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested to buy agricultural supplies like fertilizer and herbicides. His most desired dream is to be able to continue working, that is health will always allow him to, he hopes that his children will also be good people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1612248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies like fertilizers and herbicides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-07T00:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-07T00:00:11Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Porfirio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":9.22,"local_amount":9.22,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243830},{"amount":190.78,"local_amount":190.78,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":190.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536035}],"funded_date":"2014-06-16T23:49:22Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":718280,"name":"Nellie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leahcim is 17 years old and is first of two children in the family.

They applied for a loan of 130,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nMahfotha is the leader of the group. She is a 43-year-old married woman with seven children living with them in their one house in Taiz. She is an uneducated woman, but she is very active and dynamic. Her husband is an employee in the private sector and the salary which he receives is not enough to cover all of the expenses of the family. Mahfotha decided to help her husband in those expenses, so she has started selling women's clothes and accessories as a door to door business. She found this business as a good fit for her.

She is pictured with her hand raised and is the featured profile member of Thingkangphai (E) group. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her daughter in Churachandpur, which is 62 km from the city of Imphal in the northeast region of India. Her daughter is 15 years old and studying in grade 10. Her husband died from a prolonged sickness in August 2009, leaving her family with little money and forcing her to work any available jobs to provide for the family. In April 2010, her son too died, of complications from several sicknesses while she was still struggling to cope with the loss of her husband. \r\n\r\nNengkhonei managed the household affairs and her daughter\u2019s education expenses with the little amount her husband left as an army pension. In order to supplement the family income, she started a business using her weaving expertise. However, the light irregularity in her village presents a hurdle to completing her work as per the customers' deadlines. She could not continue weaving after sunset; therefore, it slows down her work. \r\n\r\nIf she wanted to weave until late hours, she has to spend extra money for an alternate lighting device like candles, petromax or a kerosene lamp. Therefore, she wants to avail the solar loan, which will help her to buy a 45-watt solar home lighting system, which will light up 4 bulbs for 12 hours a day. Since it has a 90-meter long wire, it can be installed anywhere as per the user\u2019s convenience, and since the lighting products are bright, it can provide luminance conducive to weaving and studying.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members also want to purchase a 45-watt solar home lighting system for their shops and family use.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1617519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system, so she can weave for longer hours at night.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-06-07T00:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-07T00:00:13Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingjanei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L.kimneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chingneiniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zosangliani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoicy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lunzanem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaichin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":121730,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":121730}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-10T16:30:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":719163,"name":"Kimet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kimet is a villager who wants to buy a trailer and plug for his agricultural tractor. \r\n\r\nKimet is married and is a father of two; he is in his early 60s.

In contrast, it is an area where well over half of the indigenous population lives in poverty and an estimated 30% live in extreme poverty, a level where families are unable to obtain the minimum daily caloric intake of food.\r\n\r\nTen women in the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Estrellas\u201d (The Stars) are committed to not being part of the above statistics. They are participating in the Microcredit Plus Program of the organization that combines small loans and education. They work in various small businesses including a \u201ctortiller\u00eda\u201d, where fresh tortillas are made three times each day, animal husbandry and agriculture as well as the production of typical handicrafts, crafts and textiles.\r\n\r\nMarcela, a single 21-year-old woman, is the youngest in the Trust Bank. She is requesting a loan to invest in the purchase of chickens. She plans to fatten them up and sell them at a good price. The proceeds of her sales will enable her to continue with her education as she recently returned to school to finish her secondary studies. As a small child, she was unable to continue her education as her mother died and she needed to help care for her seven siblings. Marcela is most excited to participate in the monthly educational trainings given by a Loan Officer of Friendship Bridge. Subjects covered include hygiene, health, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants as well as self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. Other topics include successful business management, including information on accounting, budgeting and customer service. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe women of the \u201cLas Estrellas\u201d Trust Bank send greetings and thanks to KIVA investors for their thoughtfulness and generosity in supplying capital for their loans. Along with their families, they face a more successful and prosperous tomorrow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5350,"image":{"id":1617651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chickens to fatten up and sell in the market.

The majority of them work in traditional textile production using their sewing and embroidery skills.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Francisca, the 38 year old President of the Trust Bank, is divorced with five children. For many years, she has focused on her goal to create a better life for herself and her children. Do\u00f1a Francisca has requested another loan that she will use to buy more of traditional ornate blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d that she will resell to wholesale customers throughout the country. With her business, Do\u00f1a Francisca can earn enough money to take care of her children, including the education of her three youngest ones and their home. She can clearly visualize a better future for all of the family!\r\n\r\nEach month, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer meets with the \u201cXecam en Victoria\u201d Trust Bank. The nine women eagerly participate in the educational trainings on timely subjects like children\u2019s nutrition and education, health and hygiene as well as the use of medicinal plants. Other topics discussed are effective business practices including accounting, budgeting, planning and customer service. It is the combination of the educational component and the loans that Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. It is a combination that works!\r\n\r\nAppreciation goes to Kiva investors for funding these essential loans. The women are so very grateful! Thank you to each Kiva investor!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":1617665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

municipality of Chichicastenango, Guatemala. It is known for its traditional K'iche' Mayan culture with distinctive language and colorful traditional dress. A recent visitor described the town as one with homes made of mud with metal roofs, dogs napping and scratching, floppy-eared pigs tied with ropes around their bellies and chickens clucking with their baby chicks following after them. \r\n\r\nSeeking better lives for themselves, their families and their community, ten women have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cSacpulupense\u201d, meaning \u201cPeople from Sacpulup\u201d. The majority of these ladies are involved in traditional textile production, as is the case of 37-year-old Mar\u00eda, the secretary of the Trust Bank, who has had six years of formal education. In spite of this, she is able and proud to keep accurate minutes of the Trust Bank meetings, as well as other proceedings and agreements. Maria has eight children. She joined the Trust Bank in order to obtain a loan which she will use to purchase good quality thread and other supplies to create typical tablecloths and napkins. She wants to attract more clients and intends to improve her designs so that they are unique and more in demand.\r\n\r\nMaria feels happy because, along with her husband, the couple has been able to send their children to school. When the children are not studying, they work with their parents in the textile business which allows the family to create and sell more of their products. \r\n\r\nMaria also participates in the monthly educational trainings of her Trust Bank, where a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer presents information on essential topics such as effective business practices, including proper accounting, budgeting, and customer service, women\u2019s rights, self esteem and health as well as nutrition and medicinal plants. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nTransforming themselves into empowered women eliminating poverty, Maria and her friends in the \u201cSacpulupense\u201d Trust Bank see a brighter and more hopeful future.

go to school. She met her partner over six months ago and he works in the city from Monday to Saturday. Since she was nine years old Rosibel has worked in agriculture, raising pigs and selling snacks (tamales, bread, \"atol\" [a cornflour drink] and other items). Her mother taught her these skills from when she was little.\r\n\r\nNow that she is living with her husband, Rosibel makes a living selling bread and tamales. She sells four days a week and it is profitable for her, since in the community where she lives there is a lot of demand for these types of products.

This will help her a lot since she has to buy wholesale, as there isn't daily transport in her community.\r\n\r\nRosibel hopes to put down a brick floor in the house where she lives with her husband, so that the floor will be in a better condition when her child is born.
