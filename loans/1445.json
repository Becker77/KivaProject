She lives in Dhupguri in Jalpaiguri district with her husband Ismail and five children (one son and four daughters).  Three of them go to school, and two are too young for school. Khateja is a homemaker.  She did not have access to formal education but she can sign her name.\r\n\r\nKhateja's husband works in his own farmland, which is their main source of income. He grows different vegetables in different seasons.  He sells his produce in the local markets as well as to people who come to purchase from them. His enthusiastic personality is something that really characterizes this young entrepreneur and it is reflected in the work that he does on his small farm.  His main challenge is lacking capital for which reason he can't expand his business. Thus he is unable to give sufficient financial sustenance to his family.  \r\n\r\nKhateja and her husband plan to grow jute in their farmland.

","en":"Dionisio is 42 years old and he works buying and selling recyclable materials in a small scrapyard. The main products that he buys are cardboard, steel, copper, bronze and aluminum. When he began the business 4 years ago he did so because he had been displaced from the municipality where he lived and had to generate income for his family in his new life. <br \/><br \/>As he had some working capital and experience in the recycling field, he started his business in order to support his two young children.  He buys the materials daily from 7  in the morning until 6 in the evening in his work place. Sellers come there one by one. His clients are wholesalers which are organized businesses who each day want more volume. <br \/><br \/>His big challenge is to have sufficient capital  to respond to this. So he is requesting a loan from Kiva, his first loan from la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy recyclable material like cardboard, steel, copper, bronze and aluminum. This investment will impact his profits through the volume of product he can buy and the projected increase that will happen with his sales. This will improve his business substantially making this loan from Kiva a success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1613104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy recyclable material like cardboard, steel, copper, bronze and aluminum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-06-07T14:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-07T14:50:07Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":90.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Refugee"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionisio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84555},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":87092},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":89704},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":92396},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":95167},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":98022},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100963},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103992},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":107112},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":110325},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":113635},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117037}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.97,"local_amount":171647,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":177620.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542780},{"amount":48.59,"local_amount":89704,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":92825.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026024},{"amount":98.86,"local_amount":187563,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":194090.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.74,"payment_id":562430845},{"amount":93.37,"local_amount":198985,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":205909.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.42,"payment_id":595164092},{"amount":44.36,"local_amount":103992,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":107611.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.97,"payment_id":624849220},{"amount":47.99,"local_amount":107112,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":110839.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.03,"payment_id":666496935},{"amount":133.65,"local_amount":340997,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":352864.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":51.05,"payment_id":730994828}],"funded_date":"2014-07-03T20:45:36Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":716123,"name":"Geoma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Geoma es soltera pero tiene un hijo, ella vive en El Alto en una casa de adobe, ella esta en calidad de cuidadora del lugar pero su fuente de ingresos principal es la artesan\u00eda y necesita un credito para comprar lana, Geoma es la unica fuente de ingresos en su hogar y necesita su ayuda.

from Zimbabwe! This is 32-year-old, David from Harare. He is married with two children, one attending school.  David runs a retail business selling clothes. The business has been in operation for eight years. He says the main challenge he faces is high import duty, which affects his profits. David has requested for a loan of $500 to purchase tracksuits, jackets and shoes for resale during the winter season. He says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow him to increase the number of orders he supplies and increase profits. In the future, David plans to grow the business to such an extent that he will be able to open a big retail shop. David is grateful for the training received from Microking and Kiva. He says he is also impressed with the quick turn around time.\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1616818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy tracksuits, jackets, and shoes for resale during the winter season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Machipisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2014-06-07T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-07T16:10:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":93.49},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":97.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":99.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":103.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":106.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.49,"local_amount":93.49,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":93.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504307228},{"amount":97.01,"local_amount":97.01,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":97.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517589631},{"amount":99.79,"local_amount":99.79,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":99.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530085614},{"amount":104.76,"local_amount":104.76,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561698657},{"amount":104.95,"local_amount":104.95,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-05T11:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595212781}],"funded_date":"2014-06-13T05:59:49Z","paid_date":"2015-02-05T11:04:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":719439,"name":"Albert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Albert is a 54-year-old father of four, all of whom go to school. \r\n\r\nUOB\u2019s farmer clients are benefiting from production financing through increased yield; however, during the post-harvest process many are living in impoverishment until they receive payment from their buyers. \r\n\r\nA new loan product for UOB, the Post-Harvest Bridge Loan, is a top-up loan for farmers who have received Agric Production financing and are waiting for their harvest to be bought.

principles that have elevated her to become a well-known woman in her place of residence. While dedicated to domestic tasks in her home, on weekends she makes bread and 'pupusas' [popular Salvadoran snacks] to sell, then on week days she sells enchiladas, cassava, and fruit drinks in a stall at the local medical clinic, some 20 meters from her house.\r\n\r\nAna lives as she grew up, very close to her parents who are very humble and hard-working persons who sell tortillas. She has 3 brothers and Ana is the youngest of the lot. It fell to her to take charge of household matters and, also, of sales in the family business, since her brothers are independent and live far from their parents. For this reason, it was difficult for her to finish her education; she reached only the 9th grade. Time passed and with her mother's spirit, she began to sell in the clinic near her house.\r\n\r\nAna took charge of domestic matters in the home, and now has 10 years experience. And for 5 years, she has operated her stall at the clinic. Ana will continue to do this, as it has become her principal source of income, providing for basic necessities in the home.\r\n\r\nMoney from the loan will be utilized to purchase a grill for making 'pupusas', since the one she uses now is quite deteriorated. She needs a new grill to continue her business and contribute to improving the house, and help with the education of a niece who is studying nursing.\r\n \r\nThe dreams and goals that Ana has for the future include to have paid off this loan and to make a new request in order to create a food business Monday through Friday. This she hopes to do with her mother's help. Ana has faith that her projects can be accomplished. Secondly, she hopes to continue helping her niece to finish her studies. Clearly, Ana loves her as if she were her own daughter. And all this she will achieve with the help of the loan and the investment of her earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1613142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She currently works at a snack stand which she owns and which is located across from the park.  She also takes care of the household chores.

She is married. Her children are already adults and independent. She turned to Arvand for the first time, because she learnt that there was a possibility to get financial support. Nafisa lives with her family in a village. She does not have higher education, as she did not have a chance to study at the university due to her family's financial difficulties. Nafisa's husband does not have an education either. He is a pensioner. \r\n\r\nIn order to have income for food, Nafisa has her own business. She is a seamstress. She sews dresses, bedding, duvets and similar on order. In addition, Nafisa has a small plot of land, where she and her husband sows greens, pumpkins and similar every year, for their own use. Their own garden helps them to save the family budget. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Nafisa would like to purchase an electrical sewing machine, as her previous machine does not work well. However, Nafisa does not have enough money for the purchase. Therefore she turned to Arvand and would like to receive a loan to purchase the sewing machine. Nafisa hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1612899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Rudaki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.133333 68.958333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-06-07T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-07T17:10:12Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nafisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":72.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":82.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":89.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":92.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":98.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":103.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":118.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.18},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.36,"local_amount":72.71,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T15:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":80.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504302972},{"amount":18.15,"local_amount":80.66,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":89.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585774},{"amount":18.08,"local_amount":80.34,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":88.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081355},{"amount":18.51,"local_amount":82.29,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":90.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562236},{"amount":19.71,"local_amount":87.59,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-18T10:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":96.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561694923},{"amount":20.05,"local_amount":89.11,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-18T10:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":98.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626704},{"amount":20.75,"local_amount":92.23,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":101.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209187},{"amount":21.58,"local_amount":95.93,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":105.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752161},{"amount":40.49,"local_amount":201.11,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":222.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.76,"payment_id":636634837},{"amount":22.8,"local_amount":118.03,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":130.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.76,"payment_id":649616176}],"funded_date":"2014-06-10T11:59:42Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":716156,"name":"Micaela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Micaela  es casada y tiene 5 hijos ella vive en El alto en una casa de adobe que es de su propiedad Micfaela es comerciante y quiere comprar refescos, azucar, mantequilla para su tienda Micaela es la unica fuente de ingresos en su hogar por lo que necesita su ayuda ","en":"\r\nMicaela is married and has five children.

is 38 years old and lives in the town of Lusaka.

People in his community go to his outlets to send and receive money as well as pay bills. He has three children, ages 9, 4 and eight months old. \r\n\r\nVincent has continued to grow his business through the help of Kiva.  He got his first loan in September of 2013. The loan helped him to expand his business and he was able to serve more customers and open up additional locations. Today, Vincent runs a total of six mobile money transfer shops. He has employed eight young women and three young men to work at his outlet locations. \r\n\r\nVincent already paid back his first loan in full. He has requested for a second loan so that he can grow his business by adding more money in his six locations. This will ensure that customers are not turned away when they need to transact large amounts of money. Vincent explains that the business of mobile money is highly dependent on how much money is in the business to service customers.\r\n\r\nVincent would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kiva lenders for their support and for helping him improve his standard of living. He looks forward to more engagement with the lenders through his updates.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":1398454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to grow his business by adding more money in his six locations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-06-07T17:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-07T17:30:06Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":77.48,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":552,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T11:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3616.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562560171},{"amount":276,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1808.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579833196},{"amount":276,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1808.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595362750},{"amount":276,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1808.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610750976},{"amount":271.19,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1808.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.81,"payment_id":624435681},{"amount":2871.33,"local_amount":19200,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-25T12:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19289.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":72.67,"payment_id":636777360}],"funded_date":"2014-06-24T13:46:20Z","paid_date":"2015-05-25T12:17:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":719456,"name":"Ma.

Dealers' prices are lower than those published in the catalogue, and the difference is the profit that dealer earns, as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales, every week.<br \/><br \/>To help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional products for her business, like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, and undergarments. <br \/><br \/>Julita hopes that her business will grow bigger and have more connections.

He is single and lives with his mother, a brother who is studying for his bachelor's degree, and an uncle who, because he is getting on in age, stays at their house so they can take care of him because he is frequently sick.\r\n\r\nAdonay has worked as a ranch hand for three years. When he finished school, he couldn't find a job related to his studies, and with the desire to help his mother with household expenses, he decided to work as a ranch hand, caring for the livestock of a man in the community. In this way, he has been able to help his mother with expenses and with his younger brother's schooling, as well as with his uncle's medicine. While he was in school, he spent the weekend farming the land and planting corn and beans, and in his free time, he made hammocks. Since he was young, he has worked with his mother, who taught him her trade. His work day starts at 3 am when he has to milk the cows because the boss arrives at 5 am to get the milk, and Adonay has to have everything ready when he arrives. Throughout the day, he has to take care of all the livestock, feeding them, and in the afternoon, at 2 pm, he has to milk them again. He lives 45 minutes away from work (by foot) and he has to leave his house a 2 am to get to work on time. There are times that he stays to sleep at work in order to get ahead on his daily chores. He ends the day very tired, but he does it gladly because he knows that his family won't want for food.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will buy a motorcycle to go from home to work in the early morning and vice versa so that he won't be so tired and sleepy on the walk. He will save time commuting, and this will allow him to spend a few more minutes with his family every day. He will buy the motorcycle in person because he'll be able to get it cheaper than mail-ordering it.\r\n\r\nAdonay's greatest dream is to be able to improve his family's living conditions and to purchase a piece of land where he can build his own home and start a family. He wants his brother to succeed in his schooling so that he can be a person of means in the community and also help his mother with household expenses so she won't have to work so hard.

They spent their lives growing coffee and took great pride in farming the land every day. Se\u00f1or Pascual's grandparents passed on to him their knowledge, experience, and the sound values and principles that have allowed him to follow in their path. When he was a young boy, Se\u00f1or Pascual's grandparents taught him how to grow coffee, and he went with them to the fields each day, carrying the tools of the coffee farmer: a machete, a mattock, and a pumpkin filled with water.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Pascual followed in the path that his grandparents made, deciding to become a coffee grower himself. This was why his grandparents left him their coffee plantation. Se\u00f1or Pascual has accumulated nearly a lifetime of experience growing coffee, which has become his main source of income and allowed him to meet his family's daily needs. Se\u00f1or Pascual has been able to raise his children and provide them with everything they needed; the children are now honest, hardworking people who support their father in every way. \r\n\r\nJust as his grandparents passed on their knowledge, experience, and land to him, Se\u00f1or Pascual now wants to leave the plantation to a grandson, whom he has raised and educated with a great deal of discipline and love.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Pascual will use the funds from this loan to purchase improved coffee seeds for a  plot of land where he'll start a nursery. He will then transplant the coffee plants to the fields, replacing older coffee plants that were infected with a blight called rust. The new plants will rejuvenate the plantation, which has become the family's heritage.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Pascual plans to support the education of his grandchildren, one of whom is studying at the national agricultural school. He also believes that  the investments that he makes with the funds from this loan, his earnings, and training his grandson to grow coffee will contribute to the reforestation of his community. Se\u00f1or Pascual's grandson will be the one to follow in the path his grandparents started as coffee growers.     \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1613180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase improved coffee seeds for a plot of land where he'll start a nursery before transplanting the coffee plants to the fields.

He has a small piece of land where he grows vegetables like cabbages, tomatoes, beans, potatoes etc. He has been doing this for more than 10 years.  His son and wife help him in his work. They carry the products to the local markets for sale.  This is the only source of income for the family.  In order to give a little more financial sustenance, he wants to cultivate other vegetables and fruits.  At present, he wants to cultivate cucumber, which is a fruit in great demand.  His main challenge is capital\r\n\r\nKhirodini heard about Kiva\u2019s Partner, BJS, from her neighbors and has applied for financial assistance with an aim to grow their agribusiness.

Jader, when he was 15 years old, began to work the land.  That is to say, to work growing corn and beans, a job that has helped in the provision for his family.  Thanks to the first loan granted by Kiva MiCredito, he managed to have a good crop, to sell part of it and store the other part to feed his family.

UOB\u2019s farmer clients are benefiting from the production financing which is significantly saving their yield or production, because during the post-harvest processes the farmers suffer poorness when they have to wait for the buyer to pay them. This Kiva Loan will play a big role as a bridge for solving their primary day to day needs during the period.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

This constructed infrastructure will help the entire community to have secure storage of their products in the future. \r\n\r\nUOB\u2019s farmer clients are benefiting from the production financing which is significantly protecting their yield or production, because during the post-harvest processes farmers suffer poorness as they have to wait for the buyer to pay them.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She has been farming for the past 12 years. This new loan product from Urwego Opportunity Bank (UOB) will help in the construction of the warehouse or store for their maize produce while they are waiting for their harvest to be bought by the buyers. This constructed infrastructure will even help the entire community to have a secure store for their produce in the future. UOB\u2019s farmer clients are benefiting from production financing which is significantly increasing their yield or production; however, during the post-harvest processes, they are suffering from lack of income as they have to wait for the buyer to pay them. This Kiva loan will play a big role as a bridge for solving their primary day-to-day needs during that period.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

UOB\u2019s farmer clients are benefiting from production financing which is significantly increasing their yield or production; however, during the post-harvest processes, they are suffering from lack of income as they have to wait for the buyer to pay them. This Kiva loan will play a big role as a bridge for solving their primary day-to-day needs during that period.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank (UOB) is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Her husband works as a laborer but earns just enough for hand-to-mouth needs  and has been striving to earn a living without a stable job. The education of her two children and covering their day-to-day consumption was challenging, so Rosegine decided to open a store selling basic goods.  \r\n\r\nThey are thankful that they joined Paglaum MPC. With very little capital, they were able to start their sari-sari (general store) business. Their daily sales go the extra mile for the family's needs. They were also able to save with their extra income. They have applied to Paglaum MPC for additional capital of PHP 50,000 to pay for more stock for Rosegine's  sari-sari store. They say they were attracted to Paglaum MPC for its savings and the insurance services of the cooperative. They want to gradually expand their little store and taste a good life someday.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and cover the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSunshine hopes to grow and expand her buy-and-sell business so that she can cover their everyday needs, especially her children's education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She used the loan to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help in her children\u2019s education and in the family's personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nGloria would like to apply for another loan of 50,000 Philippine pesos to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed in the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. Gloria looks forward to this financial assistance with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nGloria dreams of giving her children a better future and hopes that her business will always meet their everyday expenses. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1525461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her income from business is assisting their everyday household expenditures. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs. She also has a tricycle for additional income.\r\n\r\nMyrna would like to apply for another 8,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMyrna dreams to be more successful in business and hopes to have another tricycle unit. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1618671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-06-08T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-08T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myrna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.02,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504229880},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533.31,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":584.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517516974},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.7,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2921.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491464},{"amount":79.98,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3505.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625703}],"funded_date":"2014-06-09T18:08:01Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}}]}
