This locale is known for being very dynamic. Most of the inhabitants work in agriculture and animal husbandry, because of the vegetation in the area. <br \/><br \/>Maria, 43, is a single mother with a grown son who is in university. Maria is very hardworking and values herself and her improvement. She has a bazaar and stationary store in her house where she sells clothing, perfumes, costume jewelry and gift items, as well as school supplies which are most popular right now. She needs this loan so that she is stocked with the supplies her customers need. She's been doing this for 30 years and it has allowed her to care for her son, and she still supports him. She has been in the group for 3 years and likes it because the payments are easy to make. Her dreams are to improve her business and to get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1615223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing, perfumes and school supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Tosagua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-06-10T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-10T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Celenita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1161.28,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":145.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":293.76,"local_amount":290.32,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T12:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":293.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504259124},{"amount":440.63,"local_amount":435.48,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":440.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541379},{"amount":293.74,"local_amount":290.32,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":293.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530024573},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":145.16,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":146.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516678}],"funded_date":"2014-06-12T05:41:52Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T12:54:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":720733,"name":"Varduhi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Varduhi is from Dalarik village of Armavir region.

She has worked at this job for over five years; she has a good amount of experience, which is why she is a productive and efficient employee.  She got this job after submitting her CV and she was hired because she had the advantage of experience.  Before this she worked at a bookstore.

She says that she is just joining Pro Mujer; She joined through the invitation of one of the institution\u2019s advocates who formed a group in her area. Today she has a blanket and sweater weaving business. She learned this craft from her mother several years ago, and now she makes and sells these same products.\r\n \r\nThe loan she is currently requesting is to increase her merchandise (buy wool wholesale) which she will acquire from the markets in the city of El Alto, and subsequently make products to sell to clients on request. This work will provide her with income to support her family, as she lives with her partner and two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the savings offered by the institution.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1615714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-06-10T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-10T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2556.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2541.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2611.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2682.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2755.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2907.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2881.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":424.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":743.62,"local_amount":5098.32,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5138.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504264800},{"amount":380.97,"local_amount":2611.96,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2632.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546903},{"amount":391.26,"local_amount":2682.52,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2703.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030067},{"amount":401.88,"local_amount":2755.32,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2776.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522285},{"amount":412.83,"local_amount":2830.36,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2852.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655926},{"amount":844.44,"local_amount":5789.52,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5834.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579574915}],"funded_date":"2014-06-13T20:14:01Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:26:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Fried","image":null}},{"id":720969,"name":"Teofila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teofila finds pleasure in doing her gardening activities.

She is an enterprising woman.  In spite of being a single mother, she has worked hard by herself to get her two children, who both go to school, ahead.  Francisca is a woman of generous character; she has dedicated herself to helping her family.  She stopped going to school to earn a living selling clothing. \r\nFrancisca has been selling clothing for five years.  She previously dedicated her time to helping her mother with house work until she decided to start a business from which she could earn an income to support her children.  Her daily labors are a bit tiring; Francisca travels to the cantons and a lot of times has to walk long routes to visit her customers and deliver orders. \r\nWith the loan, Francisca will purchase more clothing, like men's and women's jeans, blouses and new styles of shirts, to distribute to her neighbors' homes and in the adjoining cantons.

They all live in polygamous families in Konzanso, one of the villages in the Sikasso municipality, in the third administrative region of Mali.\r\n\r\nThey have been working with the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution to carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. They are on their fourth loan with the institution, and all previous loans have been repaid in full.\r\n\r\nThe selected crop is maize featuring Fatoumata, who is standing in the middle. She will use her loan to buy agricultural inputs and seeds to maintain one hectare (about 2.47 acres).\r\n\r\nAfter harvest the crop is sold at village level in the markets of Sikasso, to a clientele composed of men and women, for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make an average profit of 100,000 CFA francs per growing season. This profit will enable her to pay off the loan, and also help her husband with daily expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1619978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy agricultural inputs and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Konzanso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-10T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-10T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":146.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokiatou\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kankoum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maratou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiarra\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noumoumousso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":903.26,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-20T11:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":506527.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":146.74,"payment_id":636515280}],"funded_date":"2014-06-11T11:12:23Z","paid_date":"2015-04-20T11:04:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":720974,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is 52 years old, with eight children, and she lives in Caridad, Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur with her husband and children.

years old and a widow for four years now, Irma lives in Rosario, Cavite with her 17-year old son. \n\nFormerly working as a quality controller in a garments factory in the Cavite Apparel Export Processing Zone, Irma began venturing into business in 1990. She would then sell pork meat to her co-workers and was able to earn an extra PhP 5,000 per month. Seeing the potentials of this business, Irma resigned from work in 1996 and decided to do full time business. \n\nIn 1997, she had the opportunity to rent a stall in a flea market where she sells meat. In 2013, she availed a loan from SEED amounting to PhP 10,000 and was able to add up fruits and vegetables in her inventory. From then on, her business grew and she is now generating PhP 12,000 average sales in a day. Irma also employed a neighbor as helper in her stall, thereby creating income opportunity also for other underprivileged individuals in her community.

They have a young daughter, who spends the day with her mother. \r\n\r\nGerman has worked as a farmer for around four years. His parents taught him the trade, and he lives on his parents plot of land. However, one month ago, he bought a small plot of land, for which he had to sell part of his harvest from last year, as the person selling the land to him was requesting upfront payment of the full amount and he says he had to sell his produce. \r\n\r\nThis is why he doesn't have any money to grow crops this year, and, as a result, he is requesting a loan to buy agricultural inputs such as compost, pesticides, herbicides and corn seeds.\r\n\r\nThe land he grows his crops on is located half an hour away from his home, and he walks there.\r\n\r\nThe loan will enable him to buy the inputs he needs and finish paying for the land he bought to build a future. He wants to have what his family needs, continue growing crops, as this is how he supports his wife and daughter, and in the future, build a home on the land he has bought."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1615217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy compost, pesticides, herbicides and corn seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-10T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-10T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"German Enrriquez","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201934}],"funded_date":"2014-06-30T14:55:35Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:05:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":718069,"name":"Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cruz es una persona de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, viven en el municipio Nahual\u00e1, departamento de Solol\u00e1, tiene dos hijas, la primera tiene 5 a\u00f1os de edad esta estudiando en la escuela de p\u00e1rvulos de la comunidad y la segunda tiene 2 a\u00f1os de edad todav\u00eda no asiste a la escuela, se dedica al cultivo de alm\u00e1cigos de caf\u00e9 le genera buena ganancia, cuando no esta trabajando en su almacigo trabaja con vecinos en sus parcelas y le pagan por d\u00eda trabajado, Cruz necesita un cr\u00e9dito por un monto de Q. 3,500.00 para comprar un lote de terreno, Cruz tiene planeado aumentar el tama\u00f1o de su almacigo y comprar m\u00e1s terreno para tener donde cultivar.","en":"Cruz is 24 years old and lives in the municipality of Nahual\u00e1 in Solol\u00e1 department.

Meet 22-year-old Jackline, a farmer living with her family on their five-acre piece of land in the Litein area of South Rift Kenya. She loves farming, and it is her main source of income. She raisies poultry, has dairy cows and grows tea.

He is a very kind, friendly, and hard-working person. He has two children and a close-knit family. His wife, Mavluda, is a caring mother. She is retired and helps her husband feed the cattle. Ibrohim's family has been in the animal husbandry business for a few years already. It is a difficult job and requires a good amount of experience. Ibrohim fattens the cattle until they are a certain weight and then sells them at the market. He uses the profits to provide for his family while saving some money to make repairs on the house. Ibrohim would like to have more cattle but does not have enough money to buy them. He has applied for a loan with MDO Arvand. He hopes for their support and expresses his gratitude to the organization. In the future, Ibrohim plans to expand his business and continue to buy more

She is married and has a 9 month old daughter. Thanks to her parent\u2019s efforts she was able to complete primary school.  Later on the lack of economic resources led her to start working from a young age in order to keep up with her necessities and to be able to provide for her young daughter who is currently 9 months old and thus help her husband. Currently Veronica lives in the city of Latacunga with her husband and young daughter in their parent\u2019s house; therefore they do not pay rent.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle that they've had has been the lack of financing to be able to make their business grow. She currently has a small textile factory; she learned this activity from working with a neighbor. She works 8 to hours a day and her mom helps her on occasion.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to invest it in buying fabrics since she won a government competition to make uniforms and in this way she will be able to fulfill her outstanding orders.

Including this loan, she is a fifth-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has completely repaid her past loan which has helped her to uplift her lifestyle at a gradual pace. Mom is a group leader of a group of three borrowers. The entire group requests a total loan amount of 3,600,000 KHR, of which Mom will take a portion of 1,400,000 KHR. She will use the loan to buy fertilizer and gasoline to use on the farm. She also plans to use a portion of her loan to buy an additional plot of land for the purpose of expanding her farm.

She has operated this business for five years. \r\n\r\nSokkea is quite new to VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She leads a group of three to get a new loan. Sokkea and one other group member are applying for 1,400,000 KHR each whereas the remaining borrower is applying for 1,000,000 KHR. Sokkea will spend her entire loan portion to buy thread and to pay for labor fees for help in dying the krama colors. She hopes that she can earn a good income to provide sufficiently for her children"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1619992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy thread and to pay for labor fees for help in dying the krama colors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham Province, Koh Sotin District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-06-11T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-11T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokkea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophpear","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":256000},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1240000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64,"local_amount":256000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T19:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":256640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504421874},{"amount":64,"local_amount":256000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":256640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517699395},{"amount":64,"local_amount":256000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":256640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530250134},{"amount":64,"local_amount":256000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":256640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542684835},{"amount":64,"local_amount":256000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":256640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561817670},{"amount":380,"local_amount":1520000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T11:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1523800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581736242},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1002500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649755851}],"funded_date":"2014-06-11T15:00:10Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:09:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":718121,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900.11,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer to increase the amount of storage for products and be able to sell them in large quantities.

He will buy manure, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and corn seeds. He hopes that everything will go well this year, since he rents the land from what his crops grow. He says that for 14,000 square meters of land, he pays four bags of corn plus one bag of sorghum. More specifically, he will buy two bags of fertilizer, two bags of manure and two bags of sulfate. The other fertilizers he uses he will buy gradually.\r\n\r\nHe will benefit from the loan, since he does not have the money to buy the fertilizers.

51-year-old man, who is married and has four children. They live in a modest, simple, loving home. Their love for each other presented them with 4 children - two girls and two boys. Two of them already finished their secondary education thanks to the efforts and dedication of their parents. Their children live in Santo Domingo because of their studies, since travelling every day from their small town would be difficult due to the lack of resources and the length of time it would take. Still, they haven't forgotten their parents, who they visit every weekend and whenever the weather is favorable. \r\n\r\nJacinto and his wife live in a small, modest home located on the route to San Crist\u00f3bal Valle Hermoso, a beautiful little town with tourist attractions that has a suitable, agreeable climate characterized by the production of cacao. Five years ago, together with his wife, the dream was born to create a small food business, which, due to a lack of capital, is very simple. But with the efforts they put into it, it is still going. These days, Jacinto's big dream is to remodel their business in order to attract customers. His beloved wife is the one in charge of preparing all the dishes. She performs her work with the love and dedication characteristic of her that she has brought to her tiny business and which has led to the gratitude and favorable comments from whoever visits it, thanks to the delicious and varied menu. \r\n\r\nJacinto has already worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, the loan he needs today is to purchase a brush cutter for day labor, because he also works on neighboring farms. This will make his work easier. \r\n\r\nJacinto and his wife thank Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and Kiva for making it possible for their working and personal lives to grow.

His business idea began 15 years ago, when, recognizing his experience as an employee in a business dedicated to the production of marble, he managed to save up and start his entrepreneurial activity that he hasn't stopped yet. In his business, he makes counters and articles that he designs using the techniques learned throughout his productive life, and in which he has worked, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., to generate income to benefit his family structure. His family consists of his wife and 3 children, ages 4 to 14. \r\n\r\nCarlos also generates income renting machinery to people who need to do jobs in the construction sector. His goal for the future is to offer all types of specialized machinery for construction and, little by little, improve the quality of life for his family. His biggest challenge is achieving sources of financing to be able to progress quickly. Currently, Carlos is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy an industrial polisher to increase his production and generate more income, which is also the success of a Kiva loan.
