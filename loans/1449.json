It is also famous for its straw hats. \r\n\r\nKarina lives in this town. She is 29, single and lives in her parents' home. She has a nine year old little girl, the daughter of a cousin who passed away, who goes to school and who she loves as if she were her own daughter.\r\n\r\nKarina is a very hardworking young woman who juggles a variety of jobs to earn a living and so that her little girl doesn't want for anything. Together with her mum Karina prepares takeaway meals and sells slippers and Avon products (perfumes, cosmetics, creams and accessories, amongst others) from season to season. She sells her merchandise from door to door, while the lunches are delivered to homes or workplaces. They have spent over three years doing this so they can get ahead. \r\n\r\nThis loan will go towards buying supplies, slippers and cosmetics.

After the war he got married and prayed to God to be cured of the terrible feelings towards his fellow men.

She lives with her husband Uttam and two children (one son and one daughter) in the village of Netajipara. She attended school only up to grade 7 due to her parents' monetary problems but she is dedicated to providing a good education to her children. Her son is now in grade 4 and her daughter in grade 1.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer, cultivating different types of vegetables and selling them in the local market. Being a housewife, she manages all the household work and then assists her husband in the farming activities. Both of them work hard to take care of their family but are unable to provide sufficient income.\r\n\r\nAnjana wants to extend her helping hands to her husband. She has decided to cultivate jute in her farmland as it is a most important and profitable crop. She thinks this will be a lucrative business because jute fibers are commonly used in making ropes , bags, sacks, canvass, gunny bags, twine, carpets, curtains, twining threads and covers for cotton bales. \r\n\r\nShe has taken the loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase jute seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation as early as possible.  She is very hopeful to earn a profit from this new cultivation which will help her to reach to her goals of giving a decent lifestyle to her family, educating her children to establish them in their life, and lastly to build a concrete house for her family.\r\n\r\nAnjana and her husband are very much thankful to the lenders (BJS and Kiva) for giving them the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1620855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

They live in their own house (semi-concrete) in Dhupguri in the district Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nShephali\u2018s husband is running his own medicine shop. Shefali is an energetic and industrious woman. She runs an animal husbandry, which she began a few years back to support her family financially.  \r\n\r\nNow Shephali wants to start a milk-selling business and wants to buy a dairy cow, so she needs some money. She came to know about BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) and has taken a loan from it to purchase a dairy cow. She will sell milk and prepare dairy products like paneer, butter, curd, etc. \r\n\r\nShe plans to sell the products to her neighbors and local market shops, which will ultimately help in generating more cash and profit as well. She hopes to give further education to her children and to assist her husband to run the family in a better way. She plans to invest the profits in the future acquisition of more cattle.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1620908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow fora  milk and milk product business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-06-11T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-11T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shephali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-11T23:14:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":721233,"name":"Luka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luka is a 31-year-old man from Nakuru, Kenya.

This positive young man is married and has a big, happy family. He has three beautiful children.  Muzafar must work hard to support such a large family. He works in livestock and milk processing. His wife helps him with the work. The income they make from cattle breeding and milk sales is spent on their family and helping out their elderly parents a little. Muzafar wants to give his children a good education. It is his dream since he could not get a good education himself. To make his dream a reality, he has to work more and increase his business. He is lacking a little of the money needed to expand his herd. Muzafar has taken out a loan from Arvand in the past, and since the service and conditions of the bank loan satisfy his needs, he decided to re-apply to Arvand.

He is married and  has three beautiful children. Odiljon and his family live very peaceably. His wife, Malokhat, is a housewife raising the children. As the head of the family, Odiljon tries to support them. Odiljon has a higher education but, unfortunately, right now he cannot find work in his profession. Because his salary is small, but he must finish his house and install windows and doors, Odiljon is doing the construction himself. He and his team set the roof, and plastered the walls. Additionally, he still works at the train station as a porter. Odiljon dreams of finishing his home soon so that his wife and children can live in a new, warm house with all amenities. Odiljon saved money all winter for the construction, but his savings are not enough to cover the installation of plastic windows and doors. Because of this financial problem, Odiljon appealed to MDO Arvand. He decided to take out a loan. Odiljon has high hopes for support, and has expressed his profound gratitude towards Arvand. In conclusion, Odiljon would like to say, \"Thanks to organizations such as MDO Arvand, the population of Tajikistan is improving the quality of life. On receiving these loans, people meet their needs and solve their problems!\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1611448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

His father, since he was  little, taught him that the only way to live a good life was working as an honest man. He cultivates 7,000 square meters of corn. He gets the daily food from it, and he sells a little bit to buy other necessary food. The distance he travels to go to the plot is about 20 minutes from his house. When he harvests, he sells part of it and he supports his family with this income. Nobody else is involved in this occupation. He works in the morning, from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.\r\nWith this loan, if God allows him to get it, he is thinking about buying four bags or fertilizer,  a container of Rafaga, and two liters of Bihedonal, among others that he\u2019ll buy during sowing season.\r\n\r\nHis dreams have always been to have its own piece of land to build his house. He states that his children are his priority and he wants them to live in his own property. He wants his kids to have the daily food. And above all, he wants God to grant him good health so he can keep working.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1615681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy four bags of fertilizer, one container of Rafaga, and two liters of Bihedonal among others he'll buy during sowing season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-11T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-11T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611770104}],"funded_date":"2014-06-12T02:38:35Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"maria c carbonero","image":null}},{"id":718495,"name":"Rosa Elvira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa ha podido recoger una gran experiencia en el campo de la comercializaci\u00f3n de ropa, zapatos, art\u00edculos de belleza y aseo gracias a que hace 9 a\u00f1os trabaja como comerciante.

She is blessed with three children (one son and two daughters). Her husband, Santosh, is 50 years old. Sumitra had attended school up to grade 6, and her husband up to grade 4. Amongst the children, one has completed a Masters Degree, and the other two children are in grade 10. Being not so educated, Sumitra is fully concerned with her children\u2019s education, and always inspires them for further studies.\r\n\r\nSumitra\u2019s husband is a farmer by occupation. He cultivates different types of vegetables and sells those to the local market. Sumitra is also involved in her own nursery works. She buys seeds and seedlings from a nursery supplier, grows them into a usable size and then sells those in the wholesale market.

She lives with her husband and 24-year-old son. She works as a nurse at the local clinic, and her husband works at the local village self governance body. Both of them work hard to be able to earn a living for the family. Their salaries, however, are not enough to fully cover the increasing needs of the family. \r\n\r\nTo be able to meet those needs Nevrik, with help of her husband, is also engaged in agricultural business: they cultivate wheat and tomatoes, and sell the agricultural produce in the local market. They also grow peaches, plums and cherry trees. The latter are an important source of their income. Nevrik currently wants to expand her agricultural business in order to meet the needs of her family more effectively. A loan of USD 3000 will help this hard-working young woman and her family, enabling her to purchase fertilizer, seeds, cover irrigation costs, and hire workers for cultivation work. \r\n\r\nShe has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Nevrik was able to run her agricultural business in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Nevrik and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agricultural business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2054,"image":{"id":1621050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

One day he invited me to join him and when he saw I had developed my own skills and styles, he left me in charge. My designs focus on using natural materials and traditional techniques. We use the method of coiling thread to decorate many of our designs. It is made by hand by people from nearby villages.\"\r\n\r\n\"This microcredit will allow me to offer work to artisans and tailors in our village, and they support their families with this work.
