about her My Schweitzer Formula.\r\n\r\nCheryl was first introduced to My Schweitzer Formula by an older woman who had smooth, radiant skin. Invented by chemist Dr. L.E. Schweitzer in the early 1900s, the formula proved to be a simple and effective multi-purpose health solution for skin. This unique combination of all-natural zinc, boron and salicylate was used for treating burns, scarring and rashes, as well as promoting clear, healthy skin. Though popular throughout the first half of the century, this holistic formula was eventually overshadowed by the chemical-based, over-the-counter products promoted by large pharmaceutical companies.\r\n\r\nAn avid user of My Schweitzer Formula for the past ten years, Cheryl is proud of her youthful, clear skin and hopes to share this miracle product with the world. After re-branding the formula and packaging it for the 21st century, she sold it locally in San Diego for the past few years and has built a loyal customer base. She is finally ready to spread awareness of this product on a national scale, creating a website and hiring a digital marketing firm to help get the word out.  \r\n\r\nShe will use her $8,500 Kiva loan to invest in Internet marketing as well as produce more inventory to meet her growing sales.\r\n\r\nCheryl ultimately hopes to once again build public awareness for this holistic, natural solution to everyday skin care.  \r\n\r\nLearn more about My Schweitzer Formula at: http:\/\/myschweitzerformula.com

She hails from Churachandpur, 62 km away from the city Imphal in Northeast state of India. She is the featured member of Council group, pictured with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nAfter her mother\u2019s death, Nengneikim, being the eldest daughter, assumed  the entire responsibility for the family upon her shoulders. She is 32 years old and still single. Nengneikim has four brothers and three sisters. Two of her younger siblings are married. Her younger brother and his family live in the capital state to earn their living.  The group members appointed Nengneikim as the group leader as she is reliable and active and would do anything to bring economic changes for the team.\r\n\r\nNengneikim and her father are the only breadwinners of the family. Her father works as a laborer in a neighboring village and earns wages on a daily basis. In order to supplement the family income, Nengneikim started a business using her own weaving expertise. She uses the hand loom method of weaving. She produces traditional wrap\u2013around skirts with colorful patterns and designs. Her weaving is well known in the locality. It usually takes a week to complete one wrap-around skirt and she then sells the finished products to distributors for 3000 INR to 4000 INR per wrap-around skirt. With the profits she gets, she pays the school fees of her younger siblings and she uses the little amount left in maintaining the household affairs. \r\n\r\nNengneikim  is very happy with the progress she has made in her business. She wanted to continue her weaving at night for longer hours to speed up her work in order to increase her production, however, having no access to regular electricity supply in the village has hampered her work pace. After 6 pm she could not continue weaving due to insufficient illumination. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Nengneikim wants to access a Kiva loan for a solar home lighting system which is generally an excellent option regarding saving extra expenditures on alternative home lighting such as kerosene, candle, petromax etc. Solar lamps are eco-friendly; they are the most unconventional method to illuminate the house and the best way to safeguard her siblings from damaging their eyesight as they usually study after dark using candles or lamplight. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members also need a solar home lighting system for their family use and for income-generating activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1622063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Green"],"use":"To

They all live in a small town on the outskirts of Churachandpur in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. They came together as a group to access a loan in order to create income activities for themselves. Tinkholhing is the group leader pictured with raised hand. She is 47 years old and is the mother of an only daughter. Her husband is a retired army pensioner. The family source of income is very limited. Therefore, in order to supplement the family income, Tinkholhing started a business using her weaving expertise. She usually weaves traditional garments like wrap-around skirts and shawls. \r\n\r\nShe can weave at least three to four wrap-around skirts in a month and supplies the finished garments to retailers from the main city Imphal, for bigger profit and faster sale. She sells the finished product to the retailers for 2500-3000 INR. \r\n\r\nWith the profits, she buys yarn of different colors and textures to continue weaving and manages to support her daughter's education better. \r\nHowever, the irregular electric supply in the town is a hurdle to income-generating people. After sunset, Tinkholhing cannot continue weaving due to insufficient lighting; this hampers her productivity and slows down her work. Therefore, she wants to access a solar loan for a lighting system to be installed in the house. Since it\u2019s cheaper than conventional electricity, one can enjoy some amount of power savings on electricity bills. It can provide a better study environment for her daughter, too.    \r\n \r\nThe rest of the group members also need a solar loan for their respective activities and household use. The group members' activities can be classified as weaving, grocery store, and tea stall, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1622075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system so she can weave for longer hours at night.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-06-13T14:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-13T14:30:23Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manngaihlun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimzahoih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneiching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vungzaching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaithanmuan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chingluan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":97384,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":97384}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-16T12:33:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":721240,"name":"Timinadia Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Timinadia  est un regroupement de femmes du Hamdallaye de la ville de Koutiala qui se connaissent et qui vivent dans de grandes familles traditionnelles avec leurs maris, enfants et autres parents.

The women all know one another and live in large, traditional families with their husbands, children and other family members.  They are, on average, 44 years old, married and have at least four children.\r\n\r\nThe women sell products such as necklaces, food ingredients, cosmetic products, firewood and fabric.  As they would all like to increase the size of their businesses, the women work with the field partner, Soro Yiriwaso.  This will be their third group loan.\r\n\r\nAwa (sitting second from the left in the photo) is a member of the Timinadia Group.  She sells cosmetic products and necklaces.  She plans to use her loan to buy a large quantity of high quality necklaces and cosmetic products (ointment, soap, cream, etc) at the markets in Koutiala.

He is a hard worker who is looking to help his family and improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nJose is very grateful to Kiva lenders because this support offered to him will allow him to buy some pieces of furniture for his home such as a bed and mattress so he will feel more comfortable. This way, he will continue working as he has been with the same effort so that he will achieve his goals. In the future, he will achieve his biggest dream: to have his own construction company."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1617677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has taken the loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase ribbed gourd seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation as early as possible.

Kabita attended school up to class V (grade 5). She lives with her husband Amulya and four sons in the small village of Dhupguri in the district Jalpaiguri, in their own kachha house (made of mud, bamboo and straw).  Their sons are students in grade 5, 9 and 10.\r\n\r\nKabita's husband is engaged in agricultural business. He has a farmland where he grows different kinds of vegetables. He sells his products in the local market and earns for their livelihood.  \r\n\r\nAs the prices of essential goods are growing day by day, it is impossible for him to bear all the expenses of their family. Kabita, being a housewife, is very energetic and hard-working.  She is determined to help her husband financially. She started a milk and milk products supply business a few years back. Her neighbors are her main customers.\r\n\r\nNow the demand for milk and milk products is growing day by day.

At first she faced some difficulties since her caf\u00e9 wasn\u2019t technically equipped and it was limited to some games services only. Now her business is going well and it is able to provide the residents and neighborhood with a good internet connection. \r\n\r\nFatima is borrowing a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner Al Majmoua for the first time. She believes the acquired loan will be open more opportunities in her business since she intends to expand her services to start selling prepaid mobile cards. She believes this will increase her number of clients and allow her to increase the size of her caf\u00e9 in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1622152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Narine was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \n\nSo, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

He is sociable, hard-working, and very conscientious. He is married and has two children. His wife, Gulrukhsor, takes care of the children and does not have a job. Umid is a master of his trade and is always working because he provides the main income for his family. He works at the railway depot and also repairs apartments on a seasonal basis. \r\n\r\nUmid recently started repairing his home after deciding to modernize and install all the amenities to make it comfortable and warm. He is getting ready to install underfloor heating, which will allow him to save money on coal and wood in the winter. He does not have the money to carry out his plan and has therefore applied for a loan with MDO Arvand, hoping to receive credit. He plans to buy building materials to install underfloor heating.\r\n\r\nUmid is an honest and responsible customer who always repays his debts on time. He would like to express gratitude for MDO Arvand's assistance and financial support.

The group is composed of eight hardworking women who feel that they have a paradise of opportunities because of the loans that they are able to access, kindly funded by Kiva investors. The ladies are involved in various businesses like vegetable sales, animal husbandry and agriculture. <br \/><br \/>Petronila, a 32-year-old mother of three children, is the Secretary of the Trust Bank. She has had six years of formal education and realizes how important it is that her children attend school. Petronila has been working hard in her animal husbandry business to meet the monthly expenses of her family. She has had a lot of experience in this area and in the past has raised chickens, cattle and horses. Now, she is seeking a new loan that she will use to purchase a calf to fatten up and sell for a good price.<br \/><br \/>The Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge combines small loans and non-formal participatory education. In each of the monthly meetings, a Loan Officer presents relevant and useful information on effective business practices including budgeting, accounting and customer service. Other subjects covered include women\u2019s rights, children\u2019s education, nutrition and health and self-esteem. Petronila finds this last topic to be really beneficial for her as she is transforming herself into a successful and empowered woman!<br \/><br \/>Kiva investors are greatly valued by Petronila and her fellow Trust Bank members. The ladies of \u201cEl Paraiso\u201d extend their thanks to each one of you who believe in them and generously fund their loans.

located just off the Pan-American Highway. Nearly the entire population of the municipality is made up of ethnic K'iche' Maya who speak the K'iche' language. It is a poor community, marked by great poverty, including malnutrition. The simply constructed homes often suffer great damage during the rainy season and a few years ago, there was a catastrophic landslide in which twenty people lost their lives.<br \/><br \/>Seven courageous women who are hungry for a brighter future have joined together to form a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cLa Rosa de Guadalupe\u201d or \u201cThe Rose of Guadalupe\u201d. These strong-willed ladies are committed to transforming their lives through hard work and education with the goal of empowering themselves and leaving poverty behind.<br \/><br \/>Cecilia is a 22-year-old member of the Trust Bank who is married with a son who is just a year old. She has a small farm where she grows broccoli, cauliflower and potatoes. She is requesting a loan which will not only allow her to buy seeds, fertilizer and supplies but also to offer short term employment to other people as she needs help with the seeding and harvesting of her crops. Cecelia wants to create enough income to support her family as well as to continue with her university studies. She has a vision of herself as an empowered and educated woman stepping into a brighter future.<br \/><br \/>The women of \u201cLa Rosa de Guadalupe\u201d Trust Bank are most aware of the value of education, both for themselves and their children. Friendship Bridge believes that the combination of small loans and education, which the organization calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d, is a real key for impoverished women to move ahead in their lives. At the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank, a Loan Officer shares information with the ladies on topics like health, hygiene and nutrition, women\u2019s rights and self-esteem as well as effective business practices including customer service, budgeting and accounting. Cecelia and her fellow Trust Bank members feel empowered and motivated and leave their meetings feeling very enthusiastic!<br \/><br \/>Speaking on behalf of the entire Trust Bank, Cecelia expresses gratitude to Kiva investors for believing in them and their ability to move ahead in their lives.

","en":"Mavjuda will turn 45 soon. She is from Konibodom and lives there with her daughter. Unfortunately her husband and son work far away in another country. Mavjuda's daughter is in school and helps her mother with her dressmaking business after classes. Mavjuda has been a seamstress for ten years and sews kurpa and kurpacha.

","en":"Abduqakhor is an active, 30-year-old young man. He is a native of the Vakhsh District. Abduqakhor is married and lives with his wife, his mother, his two brothers and his sister. In 2011, Abduqakhor opened a small cafeteria where he offers customers Turkish doner kebabs (which he makes himself) and ice cream. He is a goal-driven person by nature and now is thinking about expanding his business. He is requesting a loan for this purpose. He is requesting 1500 USD to buy a large piece of equipment for making doner kebabs. As his amount of customers has increased, he now wants to prepare more doner kebabs in order to fulfill every order quickly.  In that way, this loan will allow his business to become ever more

In order to increase their businesses, they have decided to join Soro Yiriwaso, and this is their first cycle of solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMariam (second from the left in the photo) is an important seller of wax fabrics in and around the camp.  She is planning to use her loan to buy 20 pieces of wax fabrics in S\u00e9gou. She resells her merchandise for cash and also often on credit, from her home, at the market, and also as an itinerant seller. She sells to both men and women. Thanks to this loan, she is hoping to make an average monthly profit of 20,000 CFA francs which will be used to cover some her family's expenses and also to boost her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1621120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural

This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg and other things. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price, and then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby and the people in the community. She earns PHP 300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a loan of PHP 49,0000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nEdna hopes that her business will continue to prosper and dreams of having another business. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Since the place is in a rich agricultural region, she also includes root crops, veggies and fruits in her inventories to increase her daily profit. Her store is located adjacent to her house, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rebecca is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRebecca hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to have her own grocery store.

Because Rosa was from a family with scarce resources, she wasn't able to study. She is only able write her first and last names; her children taught her so she'd be able to sign her name.

distribuye productos de la canasta familiar, una tienda humilde que puede carecer de muchas cosas pero lo que si tiene es una vendedora so\u00f1adora y luchadora de la vida la cual solicita un

sue\u00f1o continuar con el negocio volverlo m\u00e1s rentable y dejar a un lado lo que vivido en un pasado ","en":"Only a true fighter recovers from a strong blow. To tell Mar\u00eda's story, you have to know that she was a victim of forced relocation, obliged to leave her land. But she was never defeated; she never contented herself with just sitting on a street begging for subsistence handouts.  Rather, she sought alternative ways to earn money, and thanks to microloans, she was able to open a small store where she sells everyday goods. It's a humble store, and while it lacks for many things, what it does have is a salesperson who is both a dreamer and a fighter. She is asking for this loan so that she can both expand her location and fill it with more of the stock that she currently sells, such as sodas, produce, groceries and grains. She wants to expand her variety, working towards her goal of continuing to make her business more profitable, leaving behind a life from the past."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1618526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"expand her store and strengthen her sales in produce and sodas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-06-14T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-14T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Refugee"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Bernardina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":59822},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":61476},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":63176},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64923},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":66719},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":68564},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":70460},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":72409},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":74411},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":76469},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78584},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80757},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82990},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85285},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87644},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":90068},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":92558},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":95118},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":97749},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100452},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":103230},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":106085},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":109019},{"due_date":"2016-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":112032}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.6},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":719686,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad y habita en casa propia junto a su compa\u00f1ero de e vida y sus dos hijos de 12 a\u00f1os y 13 a\u00f1os de edad quienes se encuentran estudiando.
