They mostly live in traditional families in Sirakorobougou, a village in the Loulouni commune, in Sikasso, the third administrative region of Mali. They are working with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to better carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. They are on their fifth loan, and their previous loans have all been repaid correctly.\r\n\r\nSali, seated first from the right in the photo, grows rice. With her loan, she plans to buy one 50-kilogram sac of fertilizer and one drum of herbicide, and to pay the cost of labor to farm a 1\/2 hectare of land.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest crops will be sold in the village and in Sikasso to male and female customers for cash and credit.\r\n\r\nSali hopes to earn an average profit of 73,000 francs CFA per harvest. These earnings will allow her to pay back her part of the loan and its interest, and also help her husband take care of their family's everyday expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1622157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and herbicide, and to pay the cost of labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sirakorobougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-14T09:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-14T09:30:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":74.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anchata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":425000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":425000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":825.92,"local_amount":425000,"processed_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":432717.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":74.08,"payment_id":610752492}],"funded_date":"2014-07-11T01:27:17Z","paid_date":"2015-02-26T10:44:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lindsay","image":839627}},{"id":722526,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma and her husband operate their own farm for a living.

They are requesting a loan of 200,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nSomia is the leader of the group. She is a 34-year-old married woman. She studied till the Secondary school, but she couldn't complete her studies. Somia's husband is an employee in a private sector. He is very dynamic and works hard in order to improve the living standards of his family. The salary which he receives from his job is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family. Somia says that her house lacks a refrigerator, and she can't afford this thing. Inside the kitchen of her house, Rinda puts many kinds of drinks, foods, sweets, and vegetables without a refrigerator where they need to be in a cold condition. Particularly, the climate these days is very hot. Unfortunately, she doesn't have a refrigerator in order to keep all those items in a cold condition. As a result, most of those foods and drinks expire quickly.

needed in her \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in covering personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nAnaliza would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan to buy more quality used clothes to increase her product inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her income from the business will definitely help her to meet her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial assistance with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnaliza hopes that her business will continue to flourish and she desires to save for a house and lot.

Meet Bernard. He lives on a small plot of land with his wife and two children in Kericho, Kenya. The climate in this area is excellent for agriculture! For the past five years, Bernard has been involved in farming. He keeps dairy cattle and poultry on his farm. He also grows tea for sale and vegetables for consumption. To further secure the financial status of his family, Bernard holds a job that guarantees an end month salary.\r\n\r\nThe thing that Bernard enjoys most is dairy farming. He was born into it and plans to do it for the rest of his days on earth. He named his cow Lelmet. The biggest challenge Bernard and other dairy farmers experience is low market prices for milk. \r\n\r\nBernard is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter. Recently, he introduced zero-grazing to improve milk production. The problem he has had since introducing zero-grazing is preparing feed for the animals. He finds the process a bit strenuous, considering the cow used to do all the work before. \r\n\r\nWith your lending, the chaff cutter Bernard will acquire will make his work a lot easier. Another merit is that chaff cutters chop grass into much smaller bits than when cut by hand, thus making it much better for animals to eat.\r\n \r\nThis loan will benefit Bernard\u2019s family in many ways: Bernard will not break his bones preparing feed anymore; more pasture land can be prepared in a single day and stored for use for the whole week; the cattle will consume more feed because of its refined nature, leading to better health and increased milk production; and Bernard will soon realize an increase in his income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1618192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

world! Meet Joan. She is a hardworking lady who has been practicing agriculture for the last three years. She resides in Kericho, a beautiful countryside covered with manicured tea plantations. To afford a decent living, she sells milk, eggs and tea in the local market. \r\n\r\nJoan enjoys the company of her dairy cows. She spends quality time tending to them and names every animal on her farm, including the stray ones. She is always so eager to learn better ways of going about dairy farming. However, she says expensive farm inputs are increasingly becoming a major challenge for dairy farmers in Kericho.  \r\n\r\nRecently, Joan and a group of farmers from her area were trained on how to farm poultry. Before the training, most of the attendees kept poultry for subsistence. After the training, they realized farming poultry is not the chicken business, and Joan sees a lot of potential in this sector. However, she lacks capital to get started, so she is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. \r\n\r\nWith your lending, Joan will get an additional income stream. Also, with the money from her egg sales, she seeks to fully repay her loan on time. Once the loan is cleared, she will channel the extra money to cover her family-related expenses. All Joan ever wants is to have a better life for tomorrow.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1618200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She lives together with her children in the Litein, a countryside in Kenya with expansive tea plantations. She keeps dairy cows and poultry on her farm. She also grows tea and vegetables. Predictably, her primary income sources are derived from selling milk, eggs, tea leaves and vegetables. For extra money, she also offers transportation solutions to other farmers on her Indian motorcycle.\r\n\r\nFeeding animals is the activity she enjoys most out of farming. Ironically, transportation of farm produce remains Lily\u2019s biggest challenge.\r\n  \r\nLily is seeking a loan from Kiva Lenders to construct a cowshed.\r\n\r\nBefore joining Juhudi, Lily could not access loans from banks because she was considered to be a high risk client. She mobilized a small group of farmers in her village and created a group. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learned about loan management and agribusiness. She also got to learn about KIVA. \r\n\r\nNow, with your loan, Lily will construct a cowshed and later introduce zero grazing to her farm. She is projecting a significant increase in income: enough to enable her to service the loan comfortably.

Meet Betty. For the last two years, Betty has been farming on a small piece of land in Litein, a small rural town in Kenya.

Weeding crops, however, is the part she enjoys least. \r\n\r\nBetty is seeking a loan to purchase a good quality dairy cow. Traditionally, cows were kept for cultural purposes. Ironically, the cattle keepers were languishing in abject poverty. After Betty attended a dairy farm training, she had a change of perspective and made up her mind to commercialize her operations and focus on milk sales. \r\n\r\nWith your lending, Betty will purchase a dairy cow she has already identified that produces 15 to 20 liters of milk per day. This amount of milk will generate enough income to enable her to repay loan installments and keep the surplus for farm-related expenses. With growth in income, Betty will be able to create wealth and give her family a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1618120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-14T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-14T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.01,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1428.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1482.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1506.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1560.71},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1589.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1632.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1704.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1721.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1774.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1816.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1868.31},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1915.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.7,"local_amount":216.15,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":236.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570907},{"amount":18.09,"local_amount":1447.22,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1582.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054499},{"amount":18.65,"local_amount":1491.94,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1631.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547797},{"amount":18.95,"local_amount":1516.2,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1658.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561681031},{"amount":19.3,"local_amount":1543.73,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1688.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625495},{"amount":19.98,"local_amount":1598.63,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1748.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194907},{"amount":143.32,"local_amount":12186.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13328.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.01,"payment_id":696586805}],"funded_date":"2014-06-14T23:44:59Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":720192,"name":"El\u00edseo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl\u00edseo de 41 a\u00f1os de edad,  vive con su hijo de 2 a\u00f1os de edad y con su esposa quien se dedica a los oficios del hogar, El\u00edseo solo estudio hasta 5 grado, luego se dedic\u00f3 totalmente a la agricultura, aunque aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de alba\u00f1iler\u00eda para tener otra fuente de ingresos.\n\nEl\u00edseo es un hombre trabajador y dedicado totalmente a su familia, se dedica a la agricultura desde que ten\u00eda 10 a\u00f1os, trabajando al lado de su padre que fue quien le ense\u00f1o a cultivar la tierra, aparte de cultivar la tierra, El\u00edseo sabe trabajar de alba\u00f1il y eso le ayuda a mejorar sus ingresos.

women, who average 38 years of age and who have an average of two children each. The majority of them live in traditional families in Kontabougou in the Sikasso circle (Mali's third administrative region).\r\n\r\nThey collaborate with the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, so that they can carry out their farming activities successfully during the winter season. They are on their third seasonal loan from Soro Yiriwaso and the previous loans have been repaid in full. \r\n\r\nWithin the Sabali 1 group, Temba, who is standing on the far left in the photo, grows groundnut. With her loan she is planning to buy one 50 kilo sack of fertiliser and one container of weedkiller; she will also pay the labor costs for maintaining 0.5 hectares of land.

Together with her husband, they are a humble family who focus their attention on their two children. She works selling fried food such as chicharrones (a sort of pork crackling), potatoes and plantains, which are very popular with her customers. In order to meet demand, she has to use another person. She distributes the food in the bus terminal in her town, which is a big advantage because lots of passengers buy things to have something to eat for the journey. She works with another person, with whom she shares the profits.<br \/><br \/>Like all women, she has great aspirations in life such as wanting to buy her own house and making her business grow every day.  Perhaps many would make fun of her dreams, considering what she does, but she feels very proud of this job, because it is this that has enabled her to help her family get ahead. She is asking for a loan to buy supplies so she doesn't need to call on third parties, as this is reducing profit from her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1619362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies including chicharrones (a sort of pork scratching), plantains and potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Fe de Antioquia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-06-14T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-14T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":28562},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":29352},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":30164},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":30998},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":31855},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":32736},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33642},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":34572},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":35528},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36511},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37520},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":38560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.34,"local_amount":37932,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T14:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":40511.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504283556},{"amount":21.14,"local_amount":37576,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-30T09:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":40131.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":520983987},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":39204,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":41870.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531790581},{"amount":22.68,"local_amount":40314,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43055.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542542093},{"amount":22.57,"local_amount":41454,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":44273.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":561675035},{"amount":19.05,"local_amount":39006,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":41658.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.89,"payment_id":579598700},{"amount":43.14,"local_amount":89280,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":95352.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.08,"payment_id":611814060},{"amount":21.22,"local_amount":48170,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51446.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.88,"payment_id":624864050},{"amount":12.67,"local_amount":27064,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":28904.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.54,"payment_id":636621477}],"funded_date":"2014-06-16T19:13:40Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:27:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon Rees","image":null}},{"id":722742,"name":"Sofia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sofia is married and has six children, five in school and one underage.

Rinku manages the household work and assists her husband in his work. \r\n\r\nThe business of her husband is running well, but now they want to grow their business.

He is married, father to eight children and he lives with his wives and their children in a traditional family at his late father's home in Ouyerma II, one of the working-class districts of the town of Sikasso (the Republic of Mali's third administrative region).\r\n\r\nHaving had many unsuccessful business ventures, Salika began buying and selling cell phones and accessories (covers, batteries, chargers, headphones, etc.), as well as radios and televisions. He carries out his business at the Grand Market where he has a shop. Salika is in great demand from his customers for the quality of his products. With a view to increasing satisfaction of his ever-growing customer base, he decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, around two years ago, and he is on his second individual loan. With this second loan he is planning to buy six cell phones of varying brands, two radios of different brands, one television, two cartons of cell phone covers, two packs of memory cards, two large watches, three cartons of batteries and a dozen headphones.

She hasn't had any type of academic studies.  This is because when she was young her parents didn\u2019t give her the chance to go to school because they were very poor.  These days she is in a relationship and has two children who are in relationships.  They no longer live with her, so together with her husband, she lives alone.

Since life didn\u2019t give her opportunities for self-improvement, at the age of 20 she began to help her mother\u2019s friend who had a stand selling fruits and vegetables.  Eight years ago she began her own business selling pupusas [a traditional treat] in front of the town hall in her village.  Ever since then, she has been working in her own business where she makes sales of up to $70.00 daily.\r\n\r\nThis loan, which she is requesting from CREDICAMPO, is to buy an industrial griddle and to be able to start a small caf\u00e9, because currently the one she has is made from sheet metal.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years she has had a huge desire to build her own small caf\u00e9, but she hasn\u2019t yet made it happen.

They are most hopeful that KIVA lenders will again place their trust in the women, most of whom are weavers. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the previous loan cycle, we shared a report on the President of the Trust Bank, whose name is Margarita. She is 39 years of age with two children. Thanks to her profits from her weaving business, she was not only able to cover the monthly expenses of the family but also able to send her daughter to college. This has been a dream for both mother and daughter. In addition, her son is enrolled in school. Margarita is requesting a new loan in order to purchase weaving supplies, including high-quality threads, for her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAs she has been involved with Friendship Bridge for the past five years, Margarita has learned a great deal from the non-formal education segments of the monthly meetings. A Loan Officer from Friendship Bridge meets with the women and presents them with information about business management, budgeting and accounting, as well as information on children\u2019s and women\u2019s health and nutrition. Other topics include over-indebtedness and customer service. It is the combination of the loans and the non-formal education component that Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\" <p>\r\n\r\nMargarita and her fellow Trust Bank members send blessings and gratitude to KIVA lenders throughout the world. They want the lenders to know that the lenders are making a huge difference in their lives. They look forward to a brighter tomorrow as empowered women eliminating poverty!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1623123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To
