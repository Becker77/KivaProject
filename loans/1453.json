It consists of 11 rural poor women members who live below the poverty line. This group is located in a remote rural village named Phursund of Nuapada district of Odisha, India. Most of the households of this village are potters and cultivators. Tejkanti is one of the members of this group. She belongs to a potter community whose traditional business was making earthen pots. But these days many families have given up this work and are adopting other sources of income. \r\n\r\nThe lady sitting second from right with raised hand in the photo is Tejkanti. She is a very active lady of 31 years age. She lives with her husband, one son of 9 years and two daughters of 14 and 4 years. Her elder son and daughter are continuing their study in the local school.\r\n\r\nTejkanti has a vegetable cultivation farm. She and her husband manage the farm. Her husband is an active and cheerful farmer. They produce vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, carrot, cabbage, chili, cucumber, papaya, ladyfinger, onion, etc. in the farm. She sells her products to the traders of the nearest town who come to take vegetables from her farm. Her husband also goes to markets to sell the products. \r\n\r\nTejkanti says that she earns a minimum of 5,000 INR per month from this business, which is insufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family, farm expenses and the educational expenses of her children. Although she has more land for cultivation, due to lack of funds, she is not able to cultivate it. \r\n\r\nTherefore Tejkanti wants to expand her business by taking a loan of 16,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation. She is planning to use the present loan to buy a water pump, fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides for her farm. She expects a good return from her business by expanding her cultivation. Tejkanti hopes to construct a house and educate her children to lead a respectable life. She also hopes to give her whole family a bright future through her hard work. \r\n\r\nThe other ten members of this group are involved in businesses like vegetable cultivation, cycle mart, general grocery shop and vegetable vending.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1623470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Tp pay for purchasing a water pump, fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"PHURSUND, SINAPALI, NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-06-15T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-15T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":2975,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tejkanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajeswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suryakanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jashoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koushalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamunadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kantilata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anushaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabetri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":176000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-24T11:35:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":723084,"name":"Liberty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liberty is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a food vending business in the Philippines.

It was difficult to study back then, so he could not continue. The school he went to did not have a fifth grade and he would have had to go to a different town and he could not leave his responsibilities at home unattended. He got married when he was 24 and had three children with his partner, who works as a housewife. Two of their children are adults now, and their five-year-old daughter lives with them.\r\n\r\nHe is an artisan who works with clay. He makes bricks and floor tiles. A lot of people think he is a healthy, hardworking and responsible man. He has been working with this activity since he was ten years old, taught by his father. They were eight siblings in total and thanks to his father\u2019s good example he has something to work with for the rest of his life. This is his only activity, as it takes all of his time. He has always worked with this. He works just outside his house and pays some people that help him. He works from 6:00 am until 4:00 pm.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy raw materials such as wood, horse dung and clay. With this loan he will try to produce as many bricks as possible in order to have enough in stock when he receives an order. It is difficult for him to work during the rainy season. It is very important for him to have enough working capital.\r\n\r\nHe dreams of being able to continue working in order to provide for his family.

Rahel runs a business crafting Bible covers, agenda covers, and small boxes for any purpose.  Use of local weaving pattern materials is a special point of her products. Rahel usually sells her products from one house to another, but there are also some customers who come directly to her residence to order the product. She really enjoys running the business. Currently, she intends to add more varied patterns as demanded by the customers, but she does not have much capital to do so. Therefore, she is applying for a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 4.500.000. The loan will be spent on more materials of ethnic patterns. She believes that the loan will assist her to improve her

She is 37 years old, single and manages a fish farming business. She also operates an RTW and direct selling business, and cooks food to be sold during the wee hours. Her income from the business is helping with everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nFish farming has gained popularity due to the increased global need for fish as healthy and nutritious food. Farmers in the Asian countries enjoy raising fish as livestock because it requires minimal land for a high profit. Fish farming may be a business that requires specialized knowledge and extensive time, but with hard work, aquaculture can be a profitable business. Tilapia is the second most important freshwater food in the Philippines. The most important species is the Nile Tilapia (Tilapia Nolitica). Tilapia grows very fast and reaches marketable weight of at least 200 grams in less than six months. A backyard fishpond for tilapia will increase family income because it is a good quality food suitable for processing into dried, smoked, or salted dried. Other than different fish varieties, Rosemarie also has crablets, prawns, milk fish and lobsters. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 20,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nRosemarie is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan assistance to purchase more fish and other items most likely needed in her farming business. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n*Rosemarie appears here in a photo at her direct selling business since her fish farming business is situated too distant from her permanent home.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes to help her family to improve their quality of living.\r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

active married woman who is 28 years old. She is a permanent resident of Hatibandha village in Nuapada district in Odisha, India. She hails from a business class family. She resides with her husband and two children. Her children are studying in a private school in her village.\r\n  \r\nJasoda has been running a computer center with a photo copier and photo studio in her village with the help of her husband for the last nine years. Presently, she is earning a monthly income of 10,000 INR. With this small income, Jasoda can hardly manage her family's expenses along with her business investment and the educational expenses of her children. Prior to the intervention of Mahashakti Foundation, Jasoda was in search of a credit source to expand her business to meet her financial needs. When Mahashakti started working in her village, she motivated nine other women from her locality and formed a Self Help Group named Maa Mangala to take a loan for the development of their businesses. Jasoda herself took a loan of 16,000 INR to purchase a new photocopy machine for quality service to her customers. Jasoda hopes this investment will definitely help her to increase her income. With this vision, she hopes to give better higher education to her children, as now they are at the primary school stage. In the future, she dreams of purchasing a digital video camera. \r\n\r\nThe other nine members of the group are running a tailoring center, a betel shop, a computer and courier service, a Tiffin stall, vending vegetables, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1623870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a new photocopy machine ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"HATIBANDHA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T02:40:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T02:40:27Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jasoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambuja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padamphula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaushalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shail","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":160000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-29T08:14:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":720874,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and to pay for labor to assist her coffee crops.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T02:40:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T02:40:28Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T16:23:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":723307,"name":"Nabat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nabat is a 53-year-old refugee.

In the photo, she is in the standing row, first from the right.  She is planning to use her loan to buy one 50-kilo bag of fertilizers, one can of herbicide, and to cover the cost of plowing on 0.5 hectare of land. After the harvest, she sells her crops in her village and in Sikasso. Her customers are both men and women and they pay her in cash and on credit. Ami is expecting to make an average profit of 81,000 CFA francs per planting season. She will use part of this profit to repay her loan and the interest, and the rest to help her husband with the family's day-to-day expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1622895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizers and herbicides, and to cover the cost of plowing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Niantanso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Satou\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nassoun\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natogoma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussokoura\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":425000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":425000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":720886,"name":"Diana Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diana a pesar de ser madre soltera y tener ciertos problemas de salud, nunca ha dejado de trabajar y luchar por sus hijos.

In the photo, she is in the standing row, second from the left.  She is planning to use her loan to buy one 50-kilo bag of fertilizers, one can of herbicide, and to cover the cost of plowing on 0.5 hectare of land. After the harvest, she sells her crops in her village and in Sikasso. Her customers are both men and women and they pay her in cash and on credit. Fanta is expecting to make an average profit of 81,000 CFA francs per planting season. She will use part of this profit to repay her loan and the interest, and the rest to help her husband with the family's day-to-day expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1622898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizers, herbicides, and to cover the cost of plowing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Niantanso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":139.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimatou\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tintio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":440000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":440000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":785.93,"local_amount":440000,"processed_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-08T11:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":446479.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":139.07,"payment_id":624542225}],"funded_date":"2014-07-03T11:26:07Z","paid_date":"2015-04-08T11:02:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":723309,"name":"Wajasiriamali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anastazia is the mother of four children who all attend school.

Good Friday starts off with the Stations of the Cross accompanied by \"our lord Jesus Christ\" in his passion and death.  The number of people who come out for this event is surprising for being in a small town. \r\n\r\nThe communal bank \"San Judas Tadeo\" formed in this community five years ago.  The name of the communal bank came from the religion practiced by its members and from San Judas Tadeo  being a very miraculous saint.  Twelve people make up the communal bank, and each one of them has a business: Felicitas- Grocery Sales, Sara- Meat Enchilada Sales, Virginia- Grocery Sales, Paula- Food Sales, In\u00e9s- Clothing and Sandals Sales Eufemia- Handmade Tortilla Sales, Sara M- Catalog Shoe Sales, Rosal\u00eda- Beverage Sales, Marisela- Clothing Sales, Mar\u00eda- Clothing Sales, Lucia- Catalog Shoe Sales and Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles- Snack Sales.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles is a member of the communal bank and for 18 years has made her living selling snacks from her home.  She is married to se\u00f1or Marcelo, who is well-known through-out their community.  Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda has requested the loan to buy chairs and a table, gas, plates and a pan to continue with her business. \r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of keeping her customers happy is do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda's primary motivation.  She sells her snacks on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 6:00 in the evening until the last customers leave or she runs out of snacks.  She prepares everything to order to offer quality food.  \r\n \r\nRecently, do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda has been thinking of setting up a kiosk outside one of the health clinics.  She would sell the same products but from 7:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the afternoon, Monday to Friday. \r\n\r\nThe members of this communal bank are grateful to the institutions that have helped them to grow. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6900,"image":{"id":1605417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chairs and a table, gas, plates, and a pan.

Augustine hopes that in the future he will be able to have more milling machines. \r\n\r\nAugustine is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP), which primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Augustine who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans but who have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1623817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice and a new milling machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Pallisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.166667 33.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T10:40:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Augustine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":609038},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":631010},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":653775},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":677361},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":701799},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":727017}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":239.81,"local_amount":609038,"processed_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":613902.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504220121},{"amount":248.46,"local_amount":631010,"processed_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-24T09:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":636049.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519783744},{"amount":257.43,"local_amount":653775,"processed_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":658996.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529989186},{"amount":266.71,"local_amount":677361,"processed_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":682771.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542480521},{"amount":276.33,"local_amount":701799,"processed_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":707404.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561613847},{"amount":286.26,"local_amount":727017,"processed_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":732823.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579523957}],"funded_date":"2014-06-28T23:50:22Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:16:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":723357,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a married man.
