She has five buffaloes, two cows and four goats in milk. She sells milk to many of her neighbors and other people in her community. Her business is good enough for her to lead a decent life. She also sells animals to generate extra income. She has three children. She is highly motivated to provide them a beautiful life, one with food and clothing.

These members are asking for the loan for the first time to increase their merchandise and therefore their earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1618331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise such as pants, shirts, blouses, carvers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arsenia Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliam Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor De Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175.65,"local_amount":4516.75,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T09:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4532.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504157413},{"amount":175.43,"local_amount":4511.07,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517441127},{"amount":174.09,"local_amount":4476.56,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4492.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529925087},{"amount":176.3,"local_amount":4533.41,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4549.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542417571},{"amount":175.24,"local_amount":4506.1,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4522,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561555398},{"amount":173.29,"local_amount":4456.11,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4471.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579464388}],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T21:49:16Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T10:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chelsea Clark","image":1536258}},{"id":719658,"name":"Margarita De Los \u00c1ngeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Margarita es una mujer laboriosa, de 19 a\u00f1os de edad, acompa\u00f1ada y madre de un hijo quien es su mayor motivaci\u00f3n para su superaci\u00f3n, es propietaria de un taller de zapater\u00eda por m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o, el negocio lo impuls\u00f3 con ayuda de su compa\u00f1ero de vida, el cr\u00e9dito lo solicita para la compra de materia prima como es cuero sint\u00e9tico, pega blanca, pega amarilla, suelas, hebillas, hilos, etc., con esta inversi\u00f3n la socia podr\u00e1 satisfacer parte de la demanda que tiene aumentando as\u00ed las ganancias lo que le permitir\u00e1 mejorar su nivel de vida para ofrecerle a su ni\u00f1o mejores condiciones de vida.","en":"Margarita is a hard working woman.

He lives in a small town called Luanshya, located in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. He operates a Zoona mobile money transfer business. \r\n\r\nStephen has a high school diploma, which he attained in the year 2000. He did not attend college and ventured into running small businesses in order to cover his young brothers and sisters\u2019 school fees. In the last 14 years, Stephen says he has run several small businesses like selling airtime credit. His current mobile money business has a more reliable stream of income, which brings more stability for Stephen. \r\n\r\nStephen\u2019s current challenge in growing his business is accessing working capital. He explains that his business has not expanded much and the reason for this is that he does not have the necessary capital to invest in his business in order to offer his services to more customers.  This loan will allow Stephen to have more cash available in his business to serve additional customers and earn more commission.

Santanat and her husband started an animal husbandry business three years ago. They raise cows and calves of beef and dairy breeds on their livestock yard. The husband and wife take care of the livestock themselves, and at their old age this business is satisfying since it does not require hard labor. Santanat and her husband now want to increase their livestock headcount, but because they do not have enough money, Santanat requested a loan.

hardworking 50-year-old woman. She was never married and does not have children. She has lived all of her life for her parents, doing everything possible to please them. Despite being alone, Hanifa is full of happiness and desire to live. She came to Arvand for the first time when she had learned that there was an opportunity to get financial support.\r\n\r\nHanifa lives in a rural area. She does not have a higher education because she could not attend a university due to financial hardships in her family. Hanifa is involved in her own business to have an income for food. She is involved in fattening up and selling cattle. She also sells milk obtained from the livestock. Now Hanifa wants to increase her livestock headcount in order to expand her business. This is why she came to Arvand and wants to obtain this loan to buy livestock. Hanifa hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1624773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

After working for many years as a meter reader for San Diego Gas & Electric Company, Monica was forced to retire due to injuries sustained on the job. Faced with this setback, she turned adversity into opportunity by focusing on a passion she has held through her entire life: a love of art and animals.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, while shopping at her local California mall, Monica saw a kiosk selling t-shirts with dog images on them, and immediately her mind set to work on improving the designs. She expanded the idea to embroidered hats and eventually raised the capital to found her company, Animal as Art, in 2001 at the Irvine Spectrum shopping center. \r\n\r\nReception was overwhelmingly positive, with her business immediately starting to attract buzz in the local dog-owner community. Monica particularly thrives on the interpersonal aspect of what she does.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the things I like the most is to provide comfort to people who have lost their pet.  They are able to buy a t-shirt or hat with their deceased dog (breed) printed on them,\u201d said Monica.  \u201cIf the picture does not look like their deceased dog, they bring me a picture and I draw their dog. I enjoy making pet owners happy and love to be among animals myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThings were going well until the owners of the shopping mall raised the rent exorbitantly, and despite the undeniable quality of her product, Monica\u2019s margins weren\u2019t sufficient for her to keep the business above water.\r\n\r\nNow that a few years have passed, Monica is hoping to restart her business and is looking for startup capital. Monica will use her $750 Kiva loan initially to purchase inventory and set up an online store to branch out from her local market to the online market, which would increase her pool of potential customers. \r\n\r\nMonica hopes that, with the help of generous Kiva donors, her business will become a real force for pet-ownership and animal rights in her local community as well as in the cyber community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1624336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

For the last 30 years, her family has been doing a cloth weaving business. Now she has two handlooms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a town situated 40 kms away.  They prepare 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Saraswati does the initial processing of the thread to make it ready for weaving and after that, her husband fits it to the handloom and weaves the sari. They only weave saris because of the demands of the market. Her family works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves one piece of sari on each handloom. Saraswati sells her products to the local traders on a weekly basis. She earns a monthly income of Rs. 6,000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. With her present loan, Saraswati wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs of the raw material. Saraswati wishes to grow her business and save enough to complete the construction of her half-constructed house and give a better education to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other nine members of the SHG are doing various businesses like weaving, cloth selling, running a general store, a tent house and an electronics shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1624181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a bundle of yarn for weaving saris","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"HATIBANDHA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saraswati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gamgeswari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nrupa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annapurna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Premasila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Champabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":160000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-17T15:58:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":723518,"name":"Timinadia Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe TIMINADIA est compos\u00e9 de femmes mari\u00e9es elles ont en moyenne 44 ans et 4 enfants.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \n \n\n\n   \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1618048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to construct a warehouse to store maize","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2014-06-16T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-16T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanette\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1236906,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1236906}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1825,"local_amount":1236906,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1237288.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530245521}],"funded_date":"2014-06-17T02:19:14Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T17:10:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Li","image":null}},{"id":719981,"name":"Kartierton 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les  membres du groupe     KARTIERTON 2 sont des hommes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 47 ans, 5 enfants et vivant tous dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 Nimprodioula, un des villages de Sikasso, 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nIls collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est le ma\u00efs avec  Siaka Zegu\u00e9 debout \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame droite sur la photo; il  compte acheter avec son pr\u00eat, des intrants, la semence et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir  3 hectares. \nLa production est vendue au niveau du village et \u00e0 Sikasso apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e essentiellement de revendeurs venant des grandes villes. \nIl compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 500.000 francs FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi aider la grande famille dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.\n","en":"The members in the Kartierton 2 group are married men who, on average, are 47 years old and have five children.

On the average, they are 38 years old, with four children. They all live in N\u2019tomikorobougou, a neighborhood of Bamako, and know each other as neighbors. The group members work as vendors selling peanut paste, condiments, clothing and cooked dishes. With the goal of bolstering their working capital, the group members have decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are now on the first solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sitan (the one seated on the far left in the photo) is well known in the entire neighborhood as a vendor of high-quality peanut paste. She plans to use her loan to buy two bags of peanuts wholesale in Bamako. In order to make peanut paste, it is necessary to pick the best peanuts, grill and shell them and then grind them in a mill. The resulting peanut paste is ready to be retailed to a customer base composed mainly of local women. With this loan, Mrs. Sitan hopes to earn an average monthly revenue of 40,000 West African francs, which will be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1624488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

These products are farmed by Haitians, bottled by Haitians and exported by Haitians.\n\nMuhammad Yunus, a  Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and the father of microcredit, has endorsed Kreyo\u0300l Essence for funding on Kiva. All profits Kreyo\u0300l Essence makes are reinvested in the business itself to increase its social impact where it matters most: with women and farmers in Haiti.\n \nThis loan will enable Kreyo\u0300l Essence to create new jobs for Haitian farmers to grow castor plants, and new jobs for women to make castor oil from its seeds. Kreyo\u0300l Essence will focus especially on employing women, and make sure that all their employees receive fair wages and benefits. They expect to repay the loan in seven years.\n \nFunding on Kiva will allow Kreyo\u0300l Essence to access capital that is difficult to get through traditional banks in Haiti, because the loan size is too small to be profitable for a bank. You can learn more about small and medium enterprise loans on Kiva <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.kiva.org\/faqs\/kreyol-essence-qa\">here.<\/a>\n \nIn addition to job creation, Kreyo\u0300l Essence also helps to address Haiti\u2019s problem of deforestation and soil erosion. Haiti\u2019s forested lands have been reduced to less than 2%. By cultivating castor oil plants, Kreyo\u0300l Essence helps to protect the surrounding area from erosion.\n \nThe castor oil plant used in the company\u2019s products is one of the few perennials able to grow and repair depleted soils with limited rainfall and minimal agricultural inputs. Kreyo\u0300l Essence aims to plant over 40,000 castor oil plants in the next 3 years, helping to stem the tide of soil erosion."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1623231,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2977,"youtubeId":"8L64KzvJtKA","title":"Kiva
