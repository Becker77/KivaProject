She is 34 years old. She is married and has one little son. Viktoriya has a very close-knit, understanding family. She and her family live separately from her parents, but her business is a family one. Her entire close-knit family opened a cafe in the district's central market. At the cafe, Viktoriya cooks delicious ethnic cuisine while her husband Sergey makes Uzbek sambusas (Central Asian meat- and vegetable-filled pastries). The business has been going very well. Viktoriya has many customers because of her gregariousness, her friendliness, and of course, her delicious food. As the amount of customers is growing, she now needs to increase her amount of dishware and cooking utensils to keep up with sanitary standards. However, Viktoriya does not have quite enough money to buy these dishes, which is why she applied for a loan. Viktoriya relies on this organization's support and thanks MDO Arvand in

He went to school until third grade, but wasn't able to continue because of his family's financial situation. He is married and his wife is a stay-at-home mom. The family lives together at home and the 6 year old is in elementary school. <br \/><br \/>Santos has worked since he was very young as a farmer of basic grains (corn, beans). His parents taught him the trade because it was the only work option and the only way to make money then. Aside from farming, he also has cattle. He has some cows that give him milk and milk products to feed his family, as well as to generate income. In order to get to work, he walks one hour on foot, 3km from his home, to his land. His wife also helps him with the farm work.<br \/><br \/>This loan from CREDICAMPO will be used to prepare the land for planting the winter crops like corn, beans and sorghum. With the help of the loan, he will have everything efficiently and adequately prepared without suffering any losses or complications. In the future, Santos wants a better quality of life for his family, to have better production of his crops, and to live more comfortably in a solid home, and for his children to stay in school through college and become professionals. All of this he will achieve, along with his wife, through a lot of hard work and dedication."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1621550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to prepare the land for planting winter crops (corn, beans and sorghum).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-17T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-17T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":723875,"name":"020402080003 Li\u00ean Minh _ Ho\u1eb1ng Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Th\u00e0nh operates a food stall\/restaurant where she sells\u00a0fish.

Through this, he is able to support his family. He is now in need of a loan for the purchase of agricultural inputs for planting the next year's crop. It may help his son in his studies so that he can have a better future and also so Rufino can have a better income to provide his family to achieve greater well-being.

They sell various types of plastic shoes (for men and women), clothing, charcoal, food ingredients and hair extensions.\r\n\r\nAs the women would like to increase their working capital, they work with the field partner, Soro Yiriwaso.

For many years he has sold groceries at the local market. He started the business from nothing and today he has his own stall at the market. He brings all of the grocery products with him to the city. He is very driven and this character trait helps him to always move forward. He is planning to expand his inventory and offer a wider variety of products. \r\n\r\nHowever, Ravshanbek does not have quite enough money to expand his business.

When she got married she decided to do this independently. <br \/><br \/>The loan she will get will be used to increase her working capital (buying cattle) which she will purchase from sellers in the city of El Alto and later raise it on her farm to sell the milk. This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family as she is married and has 3 children. When asked what she liked about Pro Mujer she replied that she liked the life insurance that they offer.<br \/><br \/> In the photo you see a man in a coffee colored hat.

for their support. Once again Mukarram is taking out a loan to expand and improve her business. In the summer, the demand for fruit and vegetables grows because during the summer people work to prepare for the coming winter. During this season, Mukarram would like to make some extra money from sales so she can put some aside to renovate her house. She buys wholesale from farms and resells vegetables at the local market. Mukarram has extensive experience doing this.  She has been selling at the market for more than ten years. During these years, she has established many loyal customers. Because of this business, Mukarram has been able to improve her family's living conditions and even provide her son with an education.

","en":"Twenty-eight-year-old Gris is a single mother to her ten-year-old son, who is currently in school. Gris has earned respect and admiration from her friends and neighbours as she is helping her to son to prosper, and because she has set up her own little business selling basic grains outside her local municipality. \r\n\r\nGris' home is very humble: the walls are made of corrugated metal sheeting, while the frame of the house and the roof are made with wood and metal sheeting that has now deteriorated. Gris has applied for a loan from \"FUSAI\" in order to change the roof of her house. This loan will be used to buy corrugated metal sheeting and purlins. Gris tells us that she will keep up repayments on this loan so that, in the future, she may apply for further loans to make improvements to her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1621188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

As her siblings got older, they were the ones who helped her mother.  This way Carla had time to go to school.  Carla does not have books.  She studies a lot at the library because she does not have money to buy them.  However, this does not affect her interest in her education.

Ledi lives with her large family; her husband and four children. The family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where they grow maize and haricot. Ledi and her husband work hard to insure a good harvest. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. Ledi decided to start a husbandry business along these agricultural activities. She requested a loan. The Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables her to get a loan of 3,000 GEL to purchase a cow. When the cow is purchased, Ledi will milk the cow every day and will produce dairy products. This will increase the income of the family. With the increased income she will be able to improve the living conditions for her children.

This is Ronald. He is the Head Teacher of Bethel Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Entebbe in Wakiso with 147 students. Bethel Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBethel Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

This is Liton. He is the Head Teacher of Garden Nursery and Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Entebbe in Wakiso with 130 students. Garden Nursery and Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nGarden Nursery and Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Liton ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1626976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

He did not have the opportunity to go to school like others.\r\n\r\nHowever, he says that what he has learned is thanks to the effort he puts in every day. He never started his own home, because when he was planning on doing it, things didn't turn out that way, so he decided it was better to live with his mother. Now he lives with his mother and a niece. He works to provide for the three of them, since they all live off of what he earns.\r\n\r\nDespite his years, Gonzalo still wants to work to support his family. He feels proud to say he earns income for which his family is grateful, which is a blessing for them from God. Gonzalo has worked in agriculture for 38 years, which he feels has been a good experience for him. For a long time he has recalled that it was his mother who taught him to grow corn and beans. Currently he cultivates 10,500 square meters of corn and beans.\r\nIn addition to his crops, in his free time he hauls firewood to then sell it and make some extra money.\r\n\r\nThe land where he grows his crops is not far from his home, about a 15-minute walk. No one helps him, because his mother is elderly, and even if she wanted to help him, she would not be able to.\r\n\r\nHe works from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.\r\n\r\nGonzalo is requesting this loan from CrediCampo to buy a sack of manure and insecticides, among others. He says he has already started his crops, but unfortunately he does not have the resources he needs, which is why he has not been able to make progress. He is waiting for the loan to be granted, which would be a great help to him.\r\n\r\nGonzalo has always dreamed of having his own family. He says that now he will start to save money so that little by little he can build his own house and continue growing corn and beans, if that is God's wish."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1621571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a sack of manure and insecticides for his corn and bean crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-17T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-17T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gonzalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":207,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":207}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.99,"local_amount":16.55,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":17.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545805},{"amount":207.01,"local_amount":190.45,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":207.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833918}],"funded_date":"2014-06-18T11:06:48Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:09:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":724038,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes was born and raised in Makueni, a county in Kenya, but later moved to Nairobi the capital city where she settled.

With this money, Giscard will purchase additional men\u2019s shirts, ties and pants to sell.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Giscard hopes to open his own small store instead of just selling clothing on the side of the street. Eventually, Giscard dreams of being able to travel to other countries in Europe and China to purchase clothing there to sell back in Brazzaville. For Giscard, though, everything he does goes back to his family. His business is a means of supporting them financially, and he hopes that in the future, his daughter will be able to live well and go to school. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6425,"image":{"id":1624802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase additional men\u2019s shirts, ties and pants to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2014-06-17T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-17T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":6425,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giscard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stadwy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reche","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hugues","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enma\u00fcs ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ulrich","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floriane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":3100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":6425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":177300},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":179700},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181500},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":183900},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":185900},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":188300},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":190200},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":192200},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":194700},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":196700},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":199200},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":201600},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":203700},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":206200},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":208700},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":210200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":367.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":376.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":398.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":407.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":417.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":422.18},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":427.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":432.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":739.91,"local_amount":357000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":358368.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504277869},{"amount":1927.08,"local_amount":929800,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":933363.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517560452},{"amount":1622.42,"local_amount":782800,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":785800.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530043254},{"amount":2135.59,"local_amount":1030400,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1034349.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542536075}],"funded_date":"2014-06-18T13:34:51Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T13:52:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":724057,"name":"La Fidelite 3 (1) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fannie is a member of the community bank group LA FIDELIT\u00c9 3 (1) in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo.

Since she was 16, May has been working hard at her own market stand selling fruits and vegetables such as bananas, plantains, mangos, pineapples and peanuts. \r\n\r\nGetting up before 5 am every morning to travel to a distant market where the freshest fruits are found, May brings her produce to Brazzaville to sell. May calls out to potential clients, drawing them in with samples of her fruit. Now on her second loan cycle with HOPE Congo, May would like to take out a loan of 250,000 CFA to purchase additional fruits and vegetables to sell. With the increased profits from this business, May hopes to be able to travel to China to begin purchasing items there to sell back in Congo. One day, May hopes to have her own clothing shop, and dreams of eventually working in the civil service. The first step down this road is growing her current business with a new loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1624814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase additional fruits and vegetables to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2014-06-17T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-17T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"May","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Audrey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bellia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eug\u00e9nie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madeleine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clarisse ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fifie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roklace ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":1900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108800},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":110200},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111800},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":112600},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114000},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":115600},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":116400},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118000},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":119400},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":120800},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":122400},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":123200},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124800},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126200},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":127800},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.61},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":264.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":452.41,"local_amount":219000,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T13:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":219119.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504277871},{"amount":1178.34,"local_amount":570400,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":570710.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517560454},{"amount":992.81,"local_amount":480600,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":480861.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530043256},{"amount":1037.02,"local_amount":502000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":502272.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542536077},{"amount":264.42,"local_amount":128000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":128069.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561669180}],"funded_date":"2014-06-18T10:46:09Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T12:36:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":724052,"name":"Krobor Bukum Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These members are part of the group called Krobor Bukum and are beginning their seventh loan cycle with ID-Ghana.

This situation changed since the day she met Anh Chi Em Program and took out the first loan from here. Indeed, Panh used the loans to buy piglets, and with some training sessions, she gained much profit from raising pigs and selling them. This is the fourth time she has had a loan in the program and she intends to buy small fish because the fish she raised caught a disease and they all died. She hopes that with the guidance of an agricultural worker in Anh Chi Em, these situations will never occur again. \r\n\r\nPanh dreams her son will find a better job, her daughter will be successful in her career after graduation, and she will have enough money to build a new house for her family because the current house is too old and small for her big family.

He streamlined the food ordering and tracking process by bringing in an electronic POS system; enhanced the security of the restaurant by installing a 24-hour surveillance system; and most importantly, increased the quality and freshness of food products. \r\n\r\nHis 22 years\u2019 experience managing small businesses gave him the confidence and expertise necessary to ensure success at the new location in Old Town Pasadena. Domenico\u2019s has maintained the same location for over 30 years. However, the facility and parking lot was in need of renovation and continued disagreement over the lease agreement also contributed to the decision to leave said location to seek one that would

Her group is located in Samana, a lush rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. Alida, like all in this group, decided to do business with Esperanza because she needed to bring extra income to her house. She is a divorced mother of three children. She is running a miscellaneous products business where she sells different products like cosmetics, shoes, accessories, and clothing.\r\n\r\nAlida started her business with her first loan from Esperanza, and this activity allows her to support her family. With this loan she will invest in her business to increase her inventory. Her future plans are to have a wholesale store and provide her children a great education and all they need.\r\n\r\nAlida joined Esperanza almost ten years ago and this is her 18th loan.

Based on her knowledge and studies in hairdressing, manicure and pedicure, she opened a beauty salon in a sector that had the great advantage of being the only such business formally established in the area. This would mean a broad customer base, which she has been cultivating for the four years she has been operating.\r\n\r\nToday, her business is threatened because it does not comply with one of the health regulations required by the secretary of health. Consequently she is requesting a loan in order to purchase a sterilizer so that she can continue to operate as well as supplies, such as nail polish, dyes, shampoos and botox, among other items. This would convert her business into a great, well stocked beauty shop since she aspires to the kind of life sufficient to fulfill her dream of buying her own house to live in with her two children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1622469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

As the business grew, he invested in it by renovating and adding products for families and households. \r\n\r\nWalter is a fireman who used to be a construction worker, and is the father of two children who are 18 and 10 years old, one of whom attends school. Walter has always been hard-working despite having ended his education in middle school. He wants to help his family get ahead and give them the best, especially to his son, who has Downs syndrome. Walter has the support of his wife who helps him daily when he has to go to an emergency as a fireman. \r\n\r\nThis multifaceted man's business is popular.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nGloria is taking a PHP 10,000 loan to buy grocery items and orders for her customers.
