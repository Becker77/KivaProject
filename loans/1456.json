","en":"Inojat is 45 and works as a seamstress in addition to raising cattle. She sews blankets for her steady customers. She is busier now with sewing because she earns a better income from that than from raising cattle, so she handed over the cattle business to her husband. She was not able to go to university because of family circumstances and difficult times. After high school, her parents wanted her to become a good seamstress. Almost all of the women in her family are good seamstresses. She sews well and her work is in demand. She believes that good and unselfish work brings happiness to her family, because her hard work allows her to earn money to provide for those closest to her. She has a well-established business but currently does not have enough money to buy more fabric. Her husband is a responsible family man, a loving father and a caring husband who tries to provide for his family and raise intelligent children, but his business is not going as well as it had been before. Inoyat applied for a loan with MDO Arvand because of these circumstances. She hopes very much for support from Arvand so that she can keep up her business. She is grateful for the support and assistance.

The group belongs to the tribe residing in a small town in the state of Manipur, which is in the northeastern part of India. \r\n\r\nNiengneiting is a mother to a son and three daughters. She lives with her parent-in-law and her husband. Her husband, Henminlen, is a passenger auto driver by profession. He drives in and around the town. Two of her children are in beginner\u2019s level and the oldest one in primary level. Her husband earns around 400-500 INR per day. The family's income is very scarce. Her husband\u2019s business could never be of much significance in terms of profit calculation.  \r\n\r\nAs they could not manage the family\u2019s expenditure with just the meager income of her husband Niengneiting took the initiative to generate income by weaving traditional shawls and wrap-around skirts for ladies. Niengneiting said, \u201cI have never had the chance to complete my higher education because my parents were too poor. Thanks to my mother, who taught me how to weave, today I can at least provide food and clothing to my new family through weaving. Every day before I sleep, I pray for my mother\u2019s blessing so that I may weave enough to support my children to complete their higher education.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe has been weaving using the back strap, which in the long run causes back problems. \r\n\r\nFor the improvement of her business and her children\u2019s study, Niengneiting wants to avail a loan amounting to 12173 INR for a 45-watt solar light. Niengneiting says many villages where solar lights are installed see an increase in their economic activity levels. Installing solar lights in villages allows businesses to operate during the evening and night time. Therefore she believes that solar electricity will helps promote her enterprise as she can use the system to provide lighting to operate during the evening and night. \r\n\r\nLike her, the rest of the group members also need solar home lighting for their respective income-generating activities and household use. Their main activities are weaving, variety shop, grocery store and the like. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1625369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a 45-watt solar home lighting system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-06-18T14:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-18T14:30:05Z","loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimneiching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinngaihman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaikhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thethem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niengneiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luanngaihman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy Nuomsiemkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luankhanniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaizahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noukhanching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nianzaneiching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinghoinuam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chonglianhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":206941,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":206941}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-19T01:07:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":724400,"name":"Salai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salai is a 44-year-old single woman with three children.

She has been making and selling jewelry for a decade. For the last five years, she has been selling her merchandise from a stall on the waterfront. Her personal interest in beading and jewelry is what inspired her to get into this business. At first, she started out making jewelry for herself and her daughter as a hobby. Later, she attended various courses and developed her craft. After she retired, she decided to start selling her pieces for some extra income. Aynur continues to sell her own handmade pieces at her stall on the waterfront, which is open eight months a year. Doing this work makes her very happy. Her goal is to enter international jewelry fairs to show her pieces there and to become a brand. With the loan from Maya, Aynur intends to buy beads so that she can expand the range of jewelry pieces she offers. She believes that by expanding her range of products, she will sell more and thereby increase her income this summer. Her greatest wish is for her university-educated daughter to find a job.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\nAynur Han\u0131m e\u015finden bo\u015fanm\u0131\u015f ve k\u0131z\u0131 ile birlik de ya\u015f\u0131yor.

Despite his age he gets up early day after day to begin his daily chores in the fields sowing corn and beans and different vegetables for family use, so that he doesn't have to buy them in the city market.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife support a nephew who now lives with them, providing them much happiness by accompanying them in their old age.\r\n\r\nPastor has worked at farming since he was 7 years old,  going with his father to work on the hill.  Those were long days.  He learned to work from the time when the sun rose till it was dark at night; the whole day was for working, but in a few days they would finish.  Thus he learned to work thanks to his father who taught him to fight hard.  To Pastor it seems like just yesterday when, along with his brothers,  they would go to the slopes of the hill, with a well- sharpened machete and his gourd full of water, enough to last until lunch time.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy seed corn, manure, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides for this agricultural season since he already has one parcel sowed to corn which needs manure, and with the financial assistance he can buy it.\r\n\r\nPastor's hope is that his nephew will continue to live with them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1623158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seed corn, manure, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-18T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-18T15:30:08Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pastor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7.81},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8.69,"local_amount":8.69,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T11:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504243854},{"amount":8.8,"local_amount":8.8,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526818},{"amount":8.96,"local_amount":8.96,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009215},{"amount":8.94,"local_amount":8.94,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501240},{"amount":9.23,"local_amount":9.23,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":9.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420047},{"amount":8.97,"local_amount":8.97,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":8.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145181},{"amount":9.21,"local_amount":9.21,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768804},{"amount":19.5,"local_amount":19.5,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":19.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832533},{"amount":17.7,"local_amount":17.7,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":17.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200341}],"funded_date":"2014-06-18T15:55:47Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:59:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":724450,"name":"Meki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meki is a 34-year-old unwed mother of three children.

Necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de m\u00e1s productos para seguir realizando su trabajo; el cual le ayuda mucho ya que las ganancias son de mucha utilidad en el hogar. Con el pr\u00e9stamo espera incrementar la cantidad de productos de su negocio de tal manera que sus ventas aumenten de forma considerablemente, y que este le sirva de mucho ya que no cuenta con los productos necesarios para cubrir los pedidos solicitados por sus clientes a diario, y gracias a esto espera poder mejorar la calidad de vida de la familia con el aumento de los ingresos en el hogar. Ella espera en un corto plazo hacer crecer su negocio y  con esto poder seguir apoyando a su familia y que sus hijos tengan los estudios necesarios, para que puedan tener mayores oportunidades en la vida.\n\n\nCholuteca, Honduras \u2013 Mayo del  2014\n","en":"Se\u00f1ora Delmis is a very hard-working and responsible person who lives in a town in the south of Honduras with her family. She has had a business selling clothing for the past six years, which operates out of her home in the town in which she lives and in nearby communities she visits to sell her wares.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy more products to continue her work, which really helps her since the earnings are very useful in her household. With the loan, she hopes to increase the amount of products in her business so that her sales increase significantly, which will help a lot because she doesn't have all the goods she needs to cover the orders she gets from customers on a daily basis. Thanks to this, she hopes to be able to improve her family's quality of life through a boost in household income. \r\n\r\nIn the short term, she hopes to grow her business, and in this way, continue

She says that her fundamental reason for living is her family, her husband and their three children, and she works very hard together with her husband to ensure that her family gets ahead. But above all that which characterizes her is her tireless fighting spirit day after day. \r\n\r\nOne thing that she most loves to do is to raise pigs and chickens, and in her house they never lack these type of animals. Her husband worries a lot about bringing food to the family, in this way ensuring the welfare of his family. He cultivates maize and beans in his plot for consumption and sale.\r\n\r\nMarta has raised poultry and pigs since she was a young girl, and when she was married she learned a lot more over time about how to farm the earth with her husband during those long days of labour in the fields. Together before they had children, she remembers that they would wake up very early to make coffee and then he would go to the hills to work and would not return until evening when the sun had already almost set. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used for the purchase of supplies for farming season such as agrochemicals and fertilizer for maize and bean plants. This way, they will achieve better production this season and will have better earnings and more grains to eat. With this she will support her husband and will buy a couple of pigs for fattening and selling.\r\n\r\nMarta plans to improve her raising of pigs and chickens in order to better support her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1623131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase supplies for farming season such as agrochemicals and fertilizer for maize and bean plants.

They sell these items to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories.

He has been working for 13 years in agriculture and he sows maize and beans every year. These years have given him the necessary experience to harvest a good crop. Many neighbours give him a good character reference and praise the produce he sells, and this is why he has a lot of customers. He lives in his own house with his wife and two children. <br \/><br \/>Edgardo is asking for a loan through INTEGRAL to be able to buy necessary agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilisers, herbicides, etc., and at the same time to improve the land where he sows, which is shown in the photo.

She is the divorced mother of 3 children but she is currently living with her former husband, the father of her 3 children. She says that she has been working since she was a little girl. She worked with her mother and sisters. Her mother, who does the same work, has provided for her 6 children through the manufacture of different garments. Yendry tells us that she has manufactured well-made garments since she was 15 years old. Her mother makes the patterns and Yendry assembles the pieces. Yendry has worked for many years as a leading exporter of ornamental plants from her area. Three months ago, when cutting the stem of these plants, she cut her finger. It does not stop her from working on garments, but it has not completely healed.\r\nShe began this work at 15 years, and since she was very young it has been very normal for her to see machines and fabrics in her home. In recent years, she has achieved growth.

Meet Mary, a mother with one child. She hails from Murang\u2019a which is a rural town popular for pineapple and tea farming. Mary has been a farmer for only two years but she finds it to be very fulfilling! Her best part is waking up every day and heading out to the fields. However, her constant challenge is market uncertainties. Mary also engages in various personal businesses to make additional income to take greater care of her family. \r\n\r\nMary is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase poultry.

Her biggest challenge, however, is the market uncertainties.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. She has been to various financial and agricultural trainings that have empowered her to take risks. She used to dread loans but today she perceives a loan as a stepping stone to success. Elizabeth looks for lenders with favorable interest terms and repayment periods.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Elizabeth will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm.

He is particularly passionate about dairy farming. His main sources of income are milk, eggs and other personal businesses. \r\n\r\nLike any serious dairy farmer, Erick takes animal health very seriously. He drenches drugs to his dairy animals from time to time - an activity he really enjoys! However, he says the major challenge to dairy farmers in his area is lack of quality breeds of animals.\r\n \r\nErick is seeking a loan to purchase a good quality dairy cow. This cow produces more than 20 litres of milk daily. Milk sold from this cow will provide Erick with a significant amount of income on a daily basis and enough to clear loan repayments on time. \r\n\r\nErick has a clear business plan.

He sells milk, eggs, tea and a variety of food crops as a means of livelihood. Having been influenced by the success of poultry farmers, he became part of Juhudi Kilimo through a group he mobilized so as to qualify for a loan.\r\n \r\nThe father of 3 is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. He wants to get started with a couple of units of broiler poultry birds on his premises. At present, he has 34 years of experience in farming.

So, she thinks this will be a lucrative business because jute fibers are commonly used in making ropes, bags, sacks, canvas, gunny bags, twine, carpets, curtains, twining threads, and covers for cotton bales. \r\n\r\nShe has taken the loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase jute seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation as early as possible.

Both of them give hard labor to take care of their farmland and to generate income.\r\n\r\nNow they decided to cultivate cucumbers on their farmland, as it is a most useful and profitable vegetable. So, she thinks this will be a lucrative business because cucumbers are in great demand in her area, mostly in the summer season. She has taken the loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase cucumber seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nShe is very hopeful to earn a profit from this new cultivation, which will help her to reach her goals of leading a decent lifestyle. Hasina and her husband are very much thankful to the lenders for giving them the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1625611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for cultivating cucumbers on her own farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-06-19T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-19T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hasina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-19T03:36:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":724631,"name":"Noerine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noerine is 56 years old and lives in the town of Nansana in the Kampala east region of Uganda.

The mother of three has been practicing mixed farming and selling milk, eggs and vegetables in the local market. She also holds a job paying a monthly salary and a motorcycle transportation service business. Of all the economic activities she is involved in, she enjoys dairy farming the most. Farming has been engrained in her system slowly and firmly during the 13-year period she has been practicing it. Milking is her hobby. Drought periods present a challenge to Magrate because it is usually hard to find pasture for the animals.\r\n\r\nMagrate is seeking a loan form Kiva lenders to purchase a chaff cutter. This tool will help Magrate to chop up fodder into little pieces that are easy to store or mix with silage or feed to the cows. \u201cThe grass should be chopped so as to help the cow digest. This will contribute to better health and higher milk output.\u201d \r\n\r\nWith your help, Magrate will channel the additional profits to pay for her children\u2019s education and satisfy her

The parcel of land where Jos\u00e9 works is close to his house, which is why he walks to it in spite of his age. The good state of his health is the best thing he has. When he harvests the crops, he sells one part and the rest is consumed. No one else is involved in this work, which he does in the mornings from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in the purchase of supplies for the sowing of the grains. Specifically, he will buy corn and watermelon seeds, compost, herbicide, pesticide and will pay for labor. The improvement that will result from the loan is that he will now have everything prepared for the sowing of the corn crops. The need that is being met is that of access to working capital, with which he can start doing work. \r\n\r\nHe follows God first by working the land, since with this he keeps his body and mind healthy and has a secure income for his family. The loan will help him to be able to buy everything he will need to sow the crops. Upon harvesting the watermelon, he sells all of it, and he sells part of the corn, leaving the rest to be consumed. The profits made will be invested in the payment of his loan and home expenses.
