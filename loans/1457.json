He did not have the opportunity to go to school, but like all good Salvadoran fighters, he learned on his own. A few adults that he knew would meet in order to teach him, and his parents played an important role in teaching their son. Since there were no schools in the area, he did not have the opportunity to attend school. He got married when he was 22 years old, he has five children with his wife, three of them go to school and the others do not because they are not old enough. His wife is a stay at home mom, and she is the one who takes care of the housework.\r\n\r\nHe has been a farmer for more than 15 years, and his father encouraged him to be on the right track since he was young, like being responsible. The plot of land where he works is one kilometer away, and he walks there. He is also a construction worker, he does work for people who find him in the community. He also repairs electrical appliances, which gives him extra money. When he harvests the crops, he sells a portion and the rest is for personal consumption, nobody else is included in the work. He works from 6:00 am until 12:00 pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be spent on paying for the labor costs of the people who help him work, and also to buy agricultural supplies (manure, herbicide, etc.).

She is married and has three children who are all currently in school. For the past two years, Aisha has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells essential commodities. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aisha has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential goods such as sugar and salt for the business. The loan will help Aisha to generate greater profits and take good care of her family by providing enough to support their basic needs. Aisha hopes that in the future she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nAisha is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Aisha who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1625735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more essential goods like sugar and salt for her general store business.

She hopes that in the future she will be able to own another branch of the same business. \r\n\r\nWinnie is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Winnie who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1625748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Pedro on the shores of beautiful Lake Atitl\u00e1n in Guatemala. It is the largest of the communities on the lake with great natural beauty, cultural riches and a strong indigenous identity. The population is around 46,000 and those who live here are called \u201cAtitecos\u201d. The vast majority are Tz'utujil Maya, and both men and women dress in the colorful and traditional manner.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cLuz de Vida\u201d or \u201cLight of Life\u201d, is located here and is made up of eleven women. As the town is a magnet for tourism, artesians including most of the ladies in the Trust Bank create and offer all kinds of traditional crafts like beaded items and textile treasures. This is the first loan cycle for the eleven women and they are most excited and anxious to add capital to their small businesses.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is 32-year-old Rosa who attended school until the 4th grade. She is very motivated and takes her job seriously. She is a textile artist and creates beautifully adorned traditional belts called \u201cfajas\u201d that are embelished with beads and other materials. Rosa works out of her home and her children assist her so it becomes a family affair. She is requesting a loan to purchase beads by the kilo in order to create new and unique designs with the goal of increasing sales. The motivation of this dedicated woman is to be able to take care of the needs of her family, including the education of her five school-age children.\r\n\r\nRosa speaks for the ten women of the Trust Bank when she emphasizes the importance of the educational components of the monthly meetings, presented by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. The ladies want to be successful in their small businesses and so they are eager to learn how to come up with a successful business plan and budget. They want to learn about customer service. In addition, they are anxious to learn how to empower themselves with knowledge about self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. The members of the Trust Bank want to steer their children into a successful future and so they are happy to learn how to get them ready for school and how to support them with healthy nutritious meals and good hygienic practices.\r\n\r\nThank you, KIVA investors, for funding the loans for the \u201cLuz de Vida\u201d Trust Bank. Each of you is a strong beam of light in the lives of these women! You can look forward to reading about their progress in a future

Agriculture and Education are priorities of SO-COO-C. Nerjuste, leader of SO-COO-C entertained the idea to build a primary school in the community and accomplished this goal in their first year. He knows that education and food are basic needs of the people and he decided to start with a food provision store in 1997 from member\u2019s contributions.

He has experience in the agricultural sector, and started structuring the organization by implementing a committee of which he then became the coordinator. With 9 years of experience, they carried out some activities in the community in order to keep the community alive. The first one was the rehabilitation and water extraction of the source of Pal in Carrel Grand Saut, which popularized the organization in Montagne Terrible. This loan will allow the organization to purchase a large quantity of bean seeds to store during harvesting season. Farmers will be able to cheaply buy seeds during planting season, when usually the prices tend to double.

The purpose of the request is to facilitate farmers in the community of Pajes to get access to seeds and products in the planting season. Michelet, the coordinator pictured with the other members, noted many problems in different sectors such as agriculture, health, and education. Then, with a group of farmers, he started working to find a solution for these issues. Together they executed some projects to each member's satisfaction and they built a community school, an agricultural input store, fixed a road, and an irrigation system. The loan from Zafen will enable the organization to purchase a large quantity of seeds to be sold to peasants in the community. This will allow farmers to acquire seeds at an affordable price when prices have a tendency to double during the planting season.

He had some experiences in social work. Heading to Mirebalais, he wanted to support families in its neighborhoods. He gathered a few locals in the community of Denigon and discussed the problems that they had been coping with. They became conscious about the needs of community. After many meetings and discussions, in October 2009 they launched ASODEM which in Creole stands for \u201cAsosyasyon pou Devlopman Mibal\u00e8\u201d, pictured is the committee with Jean Claudion. The first activity was to allow 50 members of the organization to receive training in gardening. Since then, they've continued working to change the lives of people in Denigon.

One of her sons and one of her daughters work as officers in commune while her two other children are unemployed. Tien's husband is a teacher in a school in the village and although he has worked at this position for many years, his salary is very low. For that reason, Tien and her husband, despite their age, are working very hard at agriculture, including cultivating rice, planting vegetables and raising pigs, chickens, ducks and buffalo. Tien intends to build a new house for her family and buy some new furniture. To do this, she needs to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAccording to Tien, this is her first loan from the Anh Chi Em Program, which she decided to join right after hearing about it. She will use the loan to buy piglets and achieve her goals. She also knows that she will receive training and direct support through a home visit of an agriculture worker from Anh Chi Em, so she believes her project will succeed thanks to this help.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to significantly increase family's income and provide an abundant life for her children.

The city is surrounded by four rivers, its historical center maintains the history of the city and it has been known for its cultural heritage of humanity since December of 1999. The people are friendly and charismatic, with big hearts. They are cordial with those they visit and its culture and traditions are still maintained. The people are hard-working, like the members who fight daily to improve financial stability and to support their families.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Carmen, who is 26 years old, lives with her partner and has a daughter who is a year and a half. She is very happy because she is pregnant with her second child. Her husband works as a street vendor, and they rent where they live because they do not have their own house.\r\n\r\nCarmen works as a street vendor selling wallets and purses.

They all live there, and they have a small shed with chickens and a pig breeding center. This business has allowed him to support his family. He is also skilled as a builder and oftentimes he will get calls to do construction. With this loan, \u00c1ngel will buy more chickens to grow his business, as well as start building his current house out of cement so it is more secure. He is very grateful for the field partner and for Kiva, because this loan will be able to improve the quality of life for him and his family, and because it will allow him to grow his business.

Currently, they earn an income cultivating rice, growing vegetables, and breeding poultry and pigs. They also have a grocery store for additional earnings. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan Nhung has taken from the Anh Chi Em Program and she will use the loan to buy more chickens and ducks to expand her business. She heard about Anh Chi Em's services.  These services  include loans and training sessions about agriculture, business, and social issues.  These topics are of interest and use to her. She hopes that by joining in Anh Chi Em's activities, she can increase her income and also understand farming, breeding techniques, and gain other knowledge.\r\n\r\nNhung dreams that her child will have an excellent education which will result in a successful career.  She wants him to grow up, escape poverty, and have a better life.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Nhung wears a Thai traditional costume with white shirt and stands first from the

She lives with her partner and they have three children. She has worked as a hairdresser since she was a teenager. She started to work when she was very young, because she had to help her family. She started with taking care of the nails of the customers, like manicure and pedicure, and bit by bit she learnt more about the techniques. When she was old enough, she took up a vocational course and became a professional hairdresser.\r\n\r\nCecilia lives with her partner and the three children. Her partner works in public transportation, the older children are at school and she takes the small son with her to the salon every day. At noon, the two children return from school and do their homework in a separate room in the salon. Their father returns late at night and leaves very early in the morning. Both parents work long hours from Monday through Saturday. \"I hardly see my partner, I know he lives with us because he leaves his clothes in the bathroom,\" she says.\r\n\r\nWith the salon, Cecilia found a way of working independently.

Little by little, he bought some machines and began his business.   It is going very well for him.  \r\n\r\nPreviously, he also used to sell clothing in another city but ten years ago his merchandise was stolen and his shop vandalized, leaving him without funds.

At this point he has had four loans and he is very grateful because he has been able to gradually buy more machines.  This has helped him to improve his quality of life.

Their town is still rural but is a great natural escape, and these borrowers use this to sell their products to people visiting their town.\r\n\r\nJuana is a single woman. She lives with her family in her simple and rural home structure. Juana is very excited to be receiving her 10th loan from Esperanza International. She has successfully paid off her previous loans and taken steps to grow her business. She started her business almost six years ago.

Americo is a very responsible person who, with a lot of hard work and dedication, has been able to get his four children ahead. \r\nAmerico is grateful for the Kiva lenders because, with their help, he will be able to build his house's foundation so that later on, he can start to build the house.

His mother taught him all about running a business and still continues to help him. He sells his goods on credit from Monday to Saturday, starting work at 8 am and finishing at 7pm. He buys the merchandise for cash from wholesalers to obtain the best prices and then offers his customers competitive prices. His customers are neighbours and people who have been referred to him.\r\n\r\nRay's future goal is to have a well-stocked store.

She's managed to set aside some money for home repairs, and is requesting a loan as well to be able to start repairing her home at long last.  She wants to improve her quality of life and be able to live in a normal home, and needs your help to do so.  Through the money she earns as a seamstress, she guarantees that she'll be able to pay her loan back in full.       \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1627093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"improve her quality of life by renovating her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bohtar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T01:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T01:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.67,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safarmo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":103.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":105.61},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":109.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":119.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":122.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":124.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":130.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":136.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":144.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":154.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.47,"local_amount":103.7,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T14:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":110.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517592370},{"amount":22.88,"local_amount":105.61,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T14:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":112.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530088014},{"amount":23.68,"local_amount":109.28,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":116.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542569177},{"amount":24.21,"local_amount":111.74,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":119.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561701153},{"amount":25.86,"local_amount":119.33,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":127.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579637768},{"amount":26.46,"local_amount":122.13,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":130.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595214378},{"amount":26.95,"local_amount":124.37,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":132.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610609759},{"amount":146.82,"local_amount":703.84,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":750.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.67,"payment_id":624881818}],"funded_date":"2014-07-01T17:19:42Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:47:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}}]}
