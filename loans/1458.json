Marga Indah Ternak members intend to continue borrowing with MUK because in addition to providing loans, MUK also provides training and a consulting veterinarian for free.\r\n\r\nNi Komang managed to sell the piglets for a satisfactory price. Her sow gave birth to 10 piglets, but 2 died. She earned 150.000 IDR profit per piglet. The advantage is that she saved to expand the business. She hopes that MUK will always accompany the group until all members can be independent.\r\n\r\nTo continue the effort and increase the number of pigs, the Marga Indah Ternak group took another loan for the same amount. These loans are used to purchase piglets, especially the superior species. The pig breeding business can help increase their family's income because of easy maintenance and can be used as additional work. Most of the members work as farmers. Two of the members couldn't attend the meeting because they had a religious ceremony at the temple.\r\n\r\nThey hope their efforts this time will be more advanced so they can save money and send their children through high levels of education.\r\n\r\nNi Komang used her portion of the loan to purchase feed only because now she has two sows and nine superior piglets. She will save all the profit to use later as capital.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1626827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase feed for her pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":20000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":20000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1700,"local_amount":20000000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20067650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595202256}],"funded_date":"2014-06-27T03:57:41Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:55:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":725305,"name":"Tilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tilda is driven by passion in selling.

The lack of available teachers limited Carmen's ability to continue her studies. However, with what she did learn, today Carmen is able to make it through any situation. Carmen is single and lives alone; she was previously married, but she could not formalize her relationship with her husband and they both took separate paths. Carmen is the mother of four adult children who are all living on their own now, some far away and the others quite close to where Carmen lives. \r\n\r\nPreviously, Carmen made a living trading fresh fish, but now she sells basic goods, including dishes. She has been in this business for six months. The need for more income brought Carmen to make important decisions and Carmen started to work with a loan from CrediCampo. She invested the loan and saw the improvement it made in her business. She is requesting another loan to invest in the purchase of more merchandise. She no longer has any other sources of income because she is completely occupied by this business. Carmen makes her sales in homes around her community as she already has a loyal client base. She travels various distances and she does not always go to the same place. She works from 7am to 11pm. She travels on foot and no one else in her family is involved in the business. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in the purchase of more cooking utensils to sell. With this loan, she can have more inventory to stock her business. This loan can improve her business because she can buy greater quantities of cooking utensils and always have merchandise available. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to keep growing her sales and earn more income so she will be able to afford her necessities. The profits will be invested in making her loan repayments and enlarging her business.

He wants to provide his family with a better future. Unfortunately, the country passes with many crises. One of these crises is the powering off of the electricity. Many of the people live in darkness most of the nights around the country. The electricity crisis is one of the biggest problems in Yemen, especially after the 2011 revolution. Many of the people purchase a power generator in order to get suitable light. For this reason, Ahmmed applied for a loan of 200,000 YER from AMB to purchase a power generator for the house.\r\n\r\nAhmmed looks forward to improving the living standards of his family.

For the past two years, Shakira has been working hard to manage her food stall business, which sells snacks and charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shakira has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda.

is a hardworking woman. Lillian is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kitintale in the Kampala south region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past two years, Lillian has been working hard to manage her bakery business, which sells cakes, cookies and bread. To help expand her business, Lillian has applied for a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy flour, sugar and icing, and it will help Lillian to generate greater profits and educate her siblings. Lillian hopes that in the future she will be able to own a big bakery in the area. Lillian is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1626944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable

She has been doing this for about two years and she has seen that it provides good income for her family and that it is very productive for her. At first, she began with just a few items to sell, but with the earnings she could buy more products and by this have a wider variety of products to offer to her customers. Thanks to this and with the course of time, the sales increased. Her husband also helps her with the store, so that she can sell more and to offer a better service to her clients.\r\n\r\nShe needs the credit she asks for to invest it in her business, because she realizes that she needs many products in her store which she does not carry at the moment.

The work is hard for her, as she leads the family alone and her husband can not help her for agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nTo make her work more productive, Mariam requested a loan from Credo, which she will use to purchase a special hand tractor. Her application was approved with the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up program gives people a chance to start or re-start businesses. This loan will enable Mariam to cultivate more area and seed various kinds of fruits. Her income will significantly increase with the help of the tractor and can improve her family's living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1627041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to purchase a tractor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kheltubani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T16:10:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":51.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.22,"local_amount":43.24,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-30T09:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":44.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504300214},{"amount":25.28,"local_amount":43.34,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-03T10:05:19Z","rounded_local_amount":44.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517582912},{"amount":25.76,"local_amount":44.16,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-30T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":45.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530078342},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":45.6,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-06T10:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542559310},{"amount":247.14,"local_amount":423.66,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-04T11:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":436.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561692042}],"funded_date":"2014-06-20T18:44:02Z","paid_date":"2014-12-04T11:01:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":725448,"name":"Neema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neema is a married woman with seven children, four of whom attend school.

This profit will allow her to repay her loan and help her husband with day-to-day expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1624749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and herbicides, and pay labor expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Missirikoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":147.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Machata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":475000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":475000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":852.58,"local_amount":475000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-14T11:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":484339.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":147.42,"payment_id":624542237}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T14:12:08Z","paid_date":"2015-04-14T11:01:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":725455,"name":"Quarter B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Quarter B group consisting of 11 members. In mid 2014, these hard-working tribal women came together as a group to help one another to empower themselves and improve their earning capacity. They belong to Churachandpur in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. Hatnu, who is raising her hand in the photo, is one of the group members. She is 45 years old and lives with her four sons, one daughter and her husband. Her husband is 50 years old. He works in a municipal department (town cleaning). Her husband's income alone cannot support the family, so the family is dependent on Hatnu's business.\r\n\r\nHatnu bought a handloom (a simple machine for weaving) to increase her production. She weaves traditional shawls and wrap-around skirts. Hatnu owns three handloom machines; she employs people to run the two machines while she uses the other one to weave. She hopes to get a good business turnover by selling the finished products in bulk to the retailers and distributors. The products are in high demand during the wedding and festive seasons like Christmas. She wants to double her production. Therefore, she wishes to access a solar home lighting system to be installed in her handloom house in order to extend her business hours into the evening and night. The irregularity of lighting in the town is a hurdle for income-generating people. Hatnu believes that the solar lighting will be a great help because it reduces maintenance of alternative lighting devices and can save electricity bills with a longer back up lighting system at zero cost. \r\n\r\nWith the income she gets from the business, Hatnu pays for her children\u2019s school expenditures and with the little savings she has, Hatnu manages the family affairs. Like her the rest of the group members need a loan for their income-generating activities and for their household use. The members' activities are weaving, variety store, garment shop etc.\r\n\r\nHatnu is happy and wishes good fortune to all the lenders around the world so that they may continue their kindness to helpless people like her. She extends her warm greetings on behalf of the group. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1627035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Green"],"use":"To own a 45-watt solar home lighting system to install in her handloom house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lamneining","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mongneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S Neilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimtinting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niangrakil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":133903,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":133903}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-22T09:06:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":725456,"name":"Melanya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melanya is 54 years old and she lives in Vanadzor city in Lori region.

She lives with her spouse and has 3 children who are dependent on her. She comes from the community of El Tular, Nacaome, Valle, in southern Honduras. She has her own house, and for 10 years she has dedicated herself to making and selling cheese and milk curds. She sells her cheeses and curds to neighborhood stores, to people who have small restaurants, and to those who work making baleadas [filled tortillas] and rosquillas [fried dough rings]. She sells her products from her home, and her cheeses attract customers to visit her there. She has two people who help her with the cheese-making process. Susana is a hard-working and enterprising woman. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy milk to make curds, and also to sell it in liquid form. She would like to buy herself a pregnant cow, because she also has a small ranch. With the help of this loan, she intends to improve her income and also her standard of living. She is very happy to continue working with Prisma and Kiva. Her desire is to keep working hard to give her family a better future. This is the fourth loan she has requested. She is a woman who pays off her loans reliably, and with the loans her business has been growing. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her house. \r\n\r\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - May 2014.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1625013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504388574},{"amount":78.98,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.19,"payment_id":517665592},{"amount":78.62,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.55,"payment_id":530167332},{"amount":78.28,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.89,"payment_id":542646767},{"amount":78.35,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T14:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.82,"payment_id":561781379},{"amount":78.9,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":579738638},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595306489},{"amount":382.34,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":7560.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.47,"payment_id":610697900}],"funded_date":"2014-06-23T04:50:06Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:55:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":725466,"name":"Mwanamwinyi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanamwinyi is a hardworking and enterprising woman who greatly appreciates Kiva lenders for their financial support.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase wheat flour, beans, rice, and maize flour for her business.

Meet Nancy, a mother of two who lives on a small piece of land in Nandi Hills Location. For the last ten years, she has been growing tea and vegetables and keeping dairy cows and poultry. Predictably, she makes a income selling milk, eggs, tea leaves, and greens. \r\n\r\nNancy is here seeking a loan to purchase rabbits for cuniculture. In Kenya, rabbit meat is not typically a dietary staple for many consumers. For this reason, many farmers do not get into rabbit farming because marketing rabbit is a considerable challenge. However, there is an organization formed in Kenya that provides training to farmers, rabbits for rearing, and a market for farmers. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Nancy will be able to seize this lifetime opportunity. Using your money, she will acquire rabbits to rear. Rabbits' gestation period is just one month. A rabbit bears six times in a year. It delivers three to ten offspring at once which can be sold after 100 days. \r\n\r\nIncome from a rabbit farm will meet her skyrocketing business-related expenses. This will in turn benefit Nancy's family due to increase in income. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1627045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase rabbits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T16:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T16:50:12Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2223.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2283.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2365.32},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2408.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2489.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2540.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2608.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2708.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2752.14},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2902.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":4675.36,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4798.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570913},{"amount":27.81,"local_amount":2383.78,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2446.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054283},{"amount":25.93,"local_amount":2222.47,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2281.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547461},{"amount":29.12,"local_amount":2495.86,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680429},{"amount":28.9,"local_amount":2477.4,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2542.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624719},{"amount":30.85,"local_amount":2644.24,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2714.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193794},{"amount":62.26,"local_amount":5336.91,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5477.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261759},{"amount":61.54,"local_amount":5274.51,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5413.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600023},{"amount":27.65,"local_amount":2489.47,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2555.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.39,"payment_id":681376894}],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T02:20:35Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:47:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":725473,"name":"Nazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazi is a 59-year-old hardworking woman, from the village of Saprasia.

Meet Jeremiah, a father of one who has been involved in mixed farming for the last four years. He has a small piece of land in Nandi Hills, Kenya.  On the land, he grows tea and keeps dairy cattle and poultry. He sells milk and eggs produced at a local market where the demand is high.\r\n\r\nJeremiah is seeking a loan to venture into rabbit farming (cuniculture).  In Kenya, rabbit farming is not recognized as a \"traditional\" or \"mainstream\" livestock production system. To most farmers, it is considered a \"marginal\" or alternative form of agriculture. But to Jeremiah, rabbit farming requires modest investment as it needs only simple facilities and small land area. \u201cIt provides income from small investment in a short period.\u201d \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Jeremiah will be able to purchase rabbits for farming. There is a ready market for rabbit meat that Jeremiah is sure to sell into. Income generated from rabbit farming will relieve the heavy business-related expenses he is currently dealing with. He said, \u201cI will invest in rabbits which will boost my income and raise my family\u2019s living standard.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1627043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for rabbits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2514.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2964.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3044.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3153.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3211.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3319.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3387.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3478.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3611.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3669.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3870.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.74,"local_amount":6462.58,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6751.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570912},{"amount":38.85,"local_amount":3271.37,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3417.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054282},{"amount":37.19,"local_amount":3132.02,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3272.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547460},{"amount":37.98,"local_amount":3198.26,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3341.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680428},{"amount":39.1,"local_amount":3292.76,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3440.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624718},{"amount":41.54,"local_amount":3497.69,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3654.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193793},{"amount":85.53,"local_amount":7202.12,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7524.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261758},{"amount":44.32,"local_amount":3732.13,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3899.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600022},{"amount":43.26,"local_amount":3659.95,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3823.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.2,"payment_id":665458685},{"amount":28.85,"local_amount":2551.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2665.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.44,"payment_id":681376893}],"funded_date":"2014-06-30T19:45:29Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:47:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":725478,"name":"Fausta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fausta lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Sunavar started her small business of selling Tajik flatbread eight years ago. She buys flatbread wholesale from local bakers and then resells it at a retail price at her retail outlet. Her product is always in demand because flatbread is the main staple on the Tajik table. Thanks to her business, Sunavar is able to support and provide for her family.\r\n\r\nSunavar is now requesting a loan to increase her product turnover and use the remaining amount of the loan to make long-awaited repairs at home.

in Kenya. Among the barriers facing smallholder farmers is a low level of awareness of the importance of improved agricultural tools.  \r\n\r\nOne of the farmers using traditional tools is Irene. Irene is a mother of three who resides on a small piece of land in Nandi Hills location. For seven years, she has kept dairy cattle and poultry. During this period, she has also been growing maize, tea, and vegetables. The produce from her mixed farm, including milk, eggs, tea, maize grains, and greens, is sold in the local market. She stated that she enjoys harvesting maize. However, she said weeding was her biggest challenge. \r\n\r\nIrene is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase modern farm implements that will significantly reduce labour-intensive workloads. With your funding, Irene will quit the use of poorly manufactured tools and adapt improved tools and implements that ease the labour-intensive tasks. \r\n\r\nProceeds from this new adaptation will be channelled to satisfying her family's needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1627121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2223.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2283.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2365.32},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2408.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2489.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2540.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2608.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2708.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2752.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2902.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.1,"local_amount":4808.89,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4935.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570914},{"amount":27.85,"local_amount":2387.02,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2450.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054284},{"amount":25.98,"local_amount":2227.11,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2285.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547462},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2499.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680430},{"amount":28.95,"local_amount":2481.56,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2547.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624720},{"amount":30.89,"local_amount":2647.61,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2717.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193795},{"amount":151.07,"local_amount":12948.51,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13290.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261760}],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T13:55:31Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":724007,"name":"Rhuyubake Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Tabiya, pr\u00e9sidente du groupe Ruyubake  est  \u00e2g\u00e9e de 39 ans, mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un homme sans profession  et m\u00e8re de 8 enfants tous scolaris\u00e9s.

She was an employee of a business where they prepared and sold tamales and pastries. The owners of this business inspired her to become independent. This is how she started her business venture and continues today. Her clients place orders and she sells to them directly without a middleman. \r\n\r\nFor cooking; corn, chicken, and pork, she starts grinding and seasoning all the ingredients, she wraps it in a bijao leaf and she ties it to increase the good flavour of the vegetables mixed with the  meat. Her niece and 2 colleagues work with her and they are very good help. Her pastries and tamales are sold wholesale and retail weekly in quantities of 2000.

For the past two years, Jane has been working hard to manage her livestock business, selling cows and goats. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cows,  goats and vaccines for the animals. This will help Jane to generate greater profits and build residential houses. Jane hopes that in the future, she will be able to study a nursing course. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Esther has been working hard to manage her wholesale business selling essential commodities. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Esther has requested a loan of 900,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food items such as sugar and rice for sale, and will help Esther to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young brothers and sisters. Esther hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand business and open another branch. \r\n\r\nEsther is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past 3 years, Teopista has been working hard to manage her boutique, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Teopista has requested a loan of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy shirts, trousers, and many other clothes to sell.  This will help Teopista to generate greater profits and improve on her family's standard of living. Teopista hopes that in the future she will be able to own a bigger supermarket. \r\n\r\nTeopista is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past 6 months, she has been working hard to manage her business, which sells dry foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Evelyne has requested a loan of 800,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more foods such as maize, coffee, and beans for sale.  This will help Evelyne to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young brothers and sisters. Evelyne hopes that in the future she will be able to take a hair-dressing course. \r\n\r\nEvelyne is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He is taking a loan of 2,000,000 UGX to pay school tuition for his children. This 44-year-old man is married with 6 children who are all attending school. He hails from a village in Kinyasano ward, Western division, Rukungiri municipality in Uganda.

They are raising only one son who is too young for school.\n\nAnjina's husband farms a variety of crops on their own farmland. Anjina helps her husband in farming by sowing seeds, harvesting and carrying the produce to the market for sale. This agribusiness is the main source of income for the family. But the income from this business is so scanty that it is hardly possible for her husband to bear all the household expenses. They have decided to cultivate jute on their farmland. Jute is a very profitable crop, and there is much demand in the present market.\n\nAnjina applied for a loan from BJS to buy jute seeds, fertilizers and other agricultural inputs. She hopes that this new crop will support them with good earnings. She will utilize the profit from her business to overcome the financial hurdles, give a good education to her son and build a concrete-made house for them in the future.\n\nShe is very much grateful and thankful towards the lenders.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1618080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy jute seeds, fertilizers and other agricultural inputs for jute cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T20:10:11Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anjina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T16:59:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":718492,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to pay for his daughter's education.

For the past 3 years, she has been working hard to manage her food stall. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Saphina has requested a loan of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more raw food to sell at her stall, and will help Saphina to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child and her sister's child. She hopes that in the future she will be able to build a residential house. \r\n\r\nSaphina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is 17 years old and lives in the town of Namutumba in the Iganga region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past year, Judith has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells passion juice, sodas, and oranges. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Judith has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy passion juice, sodas, and oranges and will help Judith to generate greater profits and pay her house rent. Judith hopes that in the future, she will be able to open a retail shop. \r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1627288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

In January 2010, Ismary's friends suggested that she start a business renting out washing machines, in order to meet demand in the community. Ismary enthusiastically agreed and later decided also to sell merchandise to her customers; this allowed her to earn a little more money.\r\n\r\nIsmary now has her two businesses. She has accounts that customers need to pay, allowing her to increase capital. Sales on credit give Ismary higher profits, which allows her to maximise her income. Ismary's main customers live in the community. Ismary's goal is to have a large store open for the public, and to guarantee her daughter a good-quality education. Ismary's biggest challenges are increasing sales and gaining loyalty from her customers with good service and affordable prices.\r\n\r\nIsmary is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first she has taken out through \"Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\". With this loan, Ismary will repair her washing machines and buy merchandise, such as jeans, footwear, perfumes and more. This investment will allow Ismary to improve her business as sales and profits will increase."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1625741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to repair her washing machines and buy merchandise, such as jeans, footwear, perfumes and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T20:30:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":66.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":60335},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75795},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78069},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":80411},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":82823},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":85308},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":87867},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":90503},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93218},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":96015},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":98895},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120761}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.04,"local_amount":60335,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":62056.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542799},{"amount":41.51,"local_amount":75795,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":77957.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026041},{"amount":42.75,"local_amount":78069,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80296.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518226},{"amount":42.12,"local_amount":80411,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":82704.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.91,"payment_id":562430859},{"amount":38.95,"local_amount":82823,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":85185.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.4,"payment_id":579566595},{"amount":39.79,"local_amount":85308,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":87741.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.93,"payment_id":595164107},{"amount":40.9,"local_amount":87867,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":90373.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.22,"payment_id":611789031},{"amount":38.38,"local_amount":90503,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":93084.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.18,"payment_id":624849231},{"amount":42.07,"local_amount":93218,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":95877.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.98,"payment_id":636603322},{"amount":149.41,"local_amount":315671,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":324676.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.46,"payment_id":649571562}],"funded_date":"2014-07-02T13:47:59Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":725575,"name":"Priscar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Priscar appreciates her previous loan, which improved her standard of living.

Mageli is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kaliro in the Iganga region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past 3 years, Mageli has been working hard to manage her business, which sells produce. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mageli has requested a loan of 700,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more produce to sell, which will help Mageli to generate greater profits. Mageli hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a retail shop. \r\n\r\nMageli is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1627266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Fatuma is 22 years old and lives in the town of Zirobwe in the Luwero region of Uganda. For the past 3 years, Fatuma has been working hard to manage her business, which sells dry coffee and sugarcane. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Fatuma has requested a loan of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy coffee stems for planting and sugar cane to sell, which will help Fatuma to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living and pay school fees for her child. Fatuma hopes that in the future she will be able to take a tailoring course. \r\n\r\nFatuma is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past 2 years, Moureen has worked hard to manage her business to sell charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Moureen has requested a loan of 200,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy bulk quantities of charcoal, and will help Moureen to generate greater profits and to meet her family's essential needs. Moureen hopes that, in the future she will be able to start another business. \r\n\r\nShe is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Odisha, India formed a group named Maa Saraswati to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their businesses. Nilji village is a remotely located rural village situated about 100 kilometers away from the district headquarters.  Ranjita is one of them. The 32-year-old cheerful lady sitting with raised hand in the photo is Ranjita. She   lives with her husband, one son of nine years and one daughter of fourteen years. Her daughter is studying in 10th standard in the local government school and her son is studying in 4th standard in a private school located in the village.\n\nRanjita is running a general grocery shop in her village for the last ten years with the help of her husband. She started the business with a very small investment of her own on limited items, i.e. potatoes, sugar, tea leaves, soap, shampoo, biscuits, etc. At that time her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. With this small income it was very difficult on her part to maintain the family. Using small savings  she gradually expanded her business and now she is earning a monthly income of 8,000 INR. With this income, Ranjita is managing her family expenses as best she can, but facing financial trouble for the educational expenses of her children. \n\nWith the intervention of Mahashakti Foundation, Ranjita saw a ray of hope.Her group approached Mahashakti Foundation and  availed a group  loan of 192000 INR. Out of this amount Ranjita took a loan of  16,000 INR. With a part of this loan she is planning to pay the admission fees of her son and daughter and with the other part wants to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc. for her general store. This loan gave a solace to Ranjita as she has been able to arrange the money for the continued study of her children. Ranjita hopes to save enough for the better education of her children and purchase a new bike for her husband.\n\nThe other eleven members of the group are managing a general store business, a fabrication center, a betel shop, a tailoring center, milk selling, vegetable vending, a Tiffin (tea) stall, an egg center, etc.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1622820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay the primary school admission fees of her son, secondary school admission fees of her daughter and  purchase items for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"NILJI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-06-20T20:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-20T20:50:12Z","loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":128,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ranjita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gitanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sashimukhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gayatri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanchala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benimadhabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kakari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhalamedei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":192000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":192000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-23T18:33:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":725611,"name":"Balasan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Balasan is from Gyumri town and lives with her three school-aged children.

High School, Bhubaneswar. He has just passed into 9th class and wants to continue his studies. He is a bright student and wishes to do well in matriculation. For this Santosh has to take good tuition, which is not affordable by his parents from their present income.\n\nThe monthly income of Suma is about Rs.8,000 which is not at all sufficient to meet her monthly expenditures. The higher education of her son is now a financial burden. Hence she formed a group with three other members from her locality and applied for financial support from Mahashakti. It will be the first cycle loan for the group. From the loan Suma will pay the tuition fees and will purchase books for her son.\n\nThe three other members of her group, Monalisha, Hemalata and Pramila, also want a loan for the education of their children.

She also runs a small grocery store from her home, from which she gets enough income to cover basic household expenses while her potato plants are growing. The land that the family farm is on is an inheritance from her father and is located very close to her house, which allows her to care for her plants well.\r\nFelipa is asking for a loan in order to buy supplies for her farm so that she can attend to the potatoes she plans to grow and avoid the spread of harmful insects like the potato psyllid.

Margret is 17 years old and lives in the town of Palisa in the Iganga region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past 3 years, Margret has been working hard to manage her clothing shop. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margret has requested a loan of 750,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy clothes, and will help Margret to generate greater profits and pay her house rent. She hopes that in the future she will be able to start up a boutique. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She lives with her parents and five children in a house built with wattle and daub. She is separated, so she has to carry the weight all by herself. She makes a living selling rice-and-pork pies, which is a traditional dish popular with locals. She has been doing this for four years. This activity has helped her to have a roof over her head, and although she lives in humble conditions, she lives in peace and with dignity.\r\n\r\nMariley wants to improve her business. She prepares these pies in a wood-fired oven made with stones. She is requesting a loan to buy kitchen utensils such as pots and ladles.

Tourists explore and buyartisan goods, school children play games during their recess breaks, and pickup trucks and tuc-tucs (small taxis) whizz by. \r\n\r\nEleven women applied to receive another loan with Friendship Bridge. The group is called Flor del Lago Santa Catarina, which means Flowers of the Lake Santa Catarina. For many, it is their 10th or 15th loan. They chatter away in Kaqchikel (one of the many indigenous languages in the area) and anticipate with excitement the arrival of the loan officer and the opportunities he brings.  \r\n\r\nMaria is 47 years old and has been a member of the Flor del Lago trust bank the longest.  Her business is buying and reselling typical Guatemalan goods such as huipiles (traditional blouses), textiles (such as tablecloths and tapestries), and bracelets. \r\n\r\nShe requests a new loan to buy more textiles  and have a greater variety of goods to sell. She appreciates the investment that Friendship Bridge and Kiva investors are making in order to support her and the other members of the Flor del Lago trust bank. Maria says, \u201cWith this investment, my business will grow even more. It has changed the life of my family and it is a huge support.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaria didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to school. Unfortunately, this is the norm. Eight of the eleven women didn\u2019t attend school at all and the other three only had minimal primary education. However, all of the women realize the importance of an education.

He lives with his spouse who is a stay-at-home parent.  They have four children who all attend school.  Jose has worked in agriculture since he was 15, having learned this work from his father.  He also works as a bricklayer.  When he gets a bricklaying job he looks for people to help him with the farming and goes to work, because bricklaying pays more, and he can then pay people to help him farm.  His work place is located 20 minutes away, and he travels there by bicycle, working from 6 until 1 in the afternoon.  The loan that he is requesting though CREDICAMPO is to buy 4 bags of manure that his field needs, so that he can cultivate the 14,000 square meters that he has seeded.  He will also buy a liter of pesticide to combat pests that are afflicting his corn.  This will help a great deal, because with the money he can buy fertilizer that is good for this kind of pest.  Jose's dream is to continue working the land so that his children will have food at home.  He also wants to help them to go to school so that they can be educated, because he knows that this will help them a lot.  He knows that this will take a great deal of work and effort.
