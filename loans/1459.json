The entire indigenous population is Mayan Kich\u00e9, and the majority of the population works in agricultural endeavors. Many of the women work in traditional textile production. Actually, entire families participate in these activities.\r\n\r\nWith the goals of strengthening and increasing their textile businesses, ten women have organized themselves into a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cChicualense\u201d, which means \u201cWomen of Chicua\u201d. They have welcomed two new members to the Trust Bank, and are happy to apply for a new loan that they hope will be funded by KIVA investors.\r\n\r\nJuana is the President of the Trust Bank. She has one young son, who will be starting his formal schooling quite soon. Juana and her husband are thrilled about his anticipated entrance into primary school, and are working hard so that he has all the support that he needs, as the couple realizes that education is a vital key to a successful future. With this in mind, Juana is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she hopes will be funded by KIVA investors. She plans to use her loan to purchase thread and supplies to diversify and increase her production of traditional blouses and \u201cperajes\u201d, which are multipurpose woven carrying cloths used for utilitarian (carrying babies or purchases) or ceremonial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cChicualense\u201d Trust Bank are not only happy to receive funding for their loans but also to participate in the educational component of their monthly meetings. They receive practical and useful information from a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer about effective business practices including accounting, budgeting, savings and customer service. The women learn about proper hygiene, health, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d, and it is a most effective mixture.\r\n\r\nThe entire Trust Bank is most appreciative that there are people from throughout the world who learn about them and fund their loans. They are committed to using the funds wisely and paying them back fully and on time. Thank you, KIVA investors, for your kind and generous gesture!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":1627517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Elenor has restarted her business and now needs to provide her family with safe shelter. She has taken a PHP 6,000 housing loan through NWTF to purchase materials to rebuild her family home. She is using this loan to purchase building materials and to pay for construction labor. Elenor is committed to rebuild her devastated life, and in the future would like to save enough money so she could afford to send her children to college.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":41.4,"image":{"id":1627725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

They successfully bred their pigs and sold them with a satisfying price.\n\nAyu Komang, as the Treasure of the group,  also earns a satisfied profit, and she saving it all for future needs. The bussines help her to increase the income of her family. She has a plan to borrow a new loan, to continue the bussines. Ayu Komang maintained three super quality pigs and they grew healthy and fat. She sold them for 3,100,000 IDR and earned a net profit of 1,750,000 IDR. \n\nBecause the price of pork is quite high, this time the loan is focused to buy superior piglets for fattening. Ayu Komang will use the loan to buy superior quality piglets. She hopes that after 6 months raising pigs, the ideal weight is reached, the price of pork remains high and she will get a lot of profit. Ayu Komang plans to keep all of income and use it as working capital.\n\nWhen the loan was disbursed, the head of the group, Ni Putu, couldn\u2019t attend the meeting because she had a religious ceremony at the Temple. The woman who raised her hand is the Treasurer of the

years who lives with his spouse, Sandra and 4 children.   \nIt is clear that Manuel works hard to maintain his family and at night, after a hard day of work, the conditions in the house are not very good due to the lack of electricity.   The family currently illuminates their home with kerosene lamps the electrical utility grid does not reach this rural area.  The kerosene lamps, which must be lit by striking a match, produce substantial contamination in the house, present a risk of fire and produce a very low level of lighting. \nHe mentioned that he hopes to have light when he arises very early in the morning and so that his children can have light at night.  To improve living conditions for his family, Manuel is requesting a loan to purchase a complete solar electric system from Soluz Honduras.  With this system the illumination in the house will be with highly efficient and long life LED lamps.  With electrical light it is much easier to study and other activities are much more pleasant, such as cooking in the kitchen or gathering the family at the dinner table or in the living room. The solar electric system can power a television and radio which provide entertainment, news and education in this rural area providing better access to information from within the country and around the world. The system can also maintain the charge in a cellular telephone to allow essential communications from this rural area.\nIn addition to the reduction of toxic fumes from kerosene lamps, the solar electric system reduces the family\u2019s energy costs by eliminating the cost of kerosene, the cost of dry cell batteries for radios and the cost of cell phone charging with related cost of transport to an urban center for charging.  These savings will provide Manuel a return on his investment in the solar electric system.  The solar panel has a 25 year warranty. Soluz Honduras installs, guarantees, and maintains the system to assure that the benefits will continue for many years. \nA positive global environmental impact of this investment is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (0.25 tons per year) that results from the elimination of kerosene consumption. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1629610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a solar energy system for his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Atlantida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":390,"posted_date":"2014-06-21T07:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-21T07:50:06Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.67,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2015.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2046.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2076.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2108.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2171.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2204.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2237.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.48,"local_amount":2015.93,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2038.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":517676347},{"amount":107.58,"local_amount":2046.17,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2069.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":530183472},{"amount":108.71,"local_amount":2076.86,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2100.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.24,"payment_id":542658323},{"amount":110.44,"local_amount":2108.01,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.16,"payment_id":561792683},{"amount":112.89,"local_amount":2139.63,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2163.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.38,"payment_id":579753890},{"amount":114.97,"local_amount":2171.73,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2196,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595318497},{"amount":116.62,"local_amount":2204.3,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T11:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2228.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":612271206},{"amount":113.64,"local_amount":2237.37,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2262.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.81,"payment_id":636462450}],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T18:16:52Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":725948,"name":"Manolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manolita is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fruit and vegetable vending business in the Philippines. <br \/><br \/>She is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to purchase more fruits and vegetables to sell to her customers for her fruit and vegetable vending business.<br \/><br \/>Manolita has been in this business for four years.

During the past six months, the group has succeeded in maintaining pigs. Ni Made is the group leader who is responsible for the group and their loan repayments. They have a field officer and are regularly visited by the vet to help the pigs grow well. Ni Made has three pigs to fatten and she is sold out. But the group is a bit disappointed because the price for pigs has been really low this month in their area. However, group members keep up their spirits to manage their businesses. Ni Made has not earned a profit recently but she continues her business with the full support of her husband.\r\n\r\nNi Made is requesting a loan to purchase two piglets, vitamins, and feed.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\n\nMary Rosaly is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to purchase more groceries to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nIn the future, she desires to manage a bigger store. She hopes that her family will always be healthy and in good hands.\n\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1626055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-06-21T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-21T17:30:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Rosaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.35,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T10:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6959.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504229956},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6959.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517080},{"amount":126.64,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5567.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000041},{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":1333.38,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1391.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491564}],"funded_date":"2014-06-21T23:37:46Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:16:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":725160,"name":"Marianita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael Edrick is 16 years old and is second of the three children in the family.

It has been the primary source of income of her family. This is the third loan cycle for Sarorn from Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. She has repaid the past loan completely and it has allowed her to improve the living condition of her family. Now, she leads a group of two members to request a loan of 2,800,000 KHR which will be divided in equal shares of 1,400,000 KHR each.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

They are involved in various activities, such as buying and selling condiments for example, which is the case of Tenimba (in the front row, first from the left).  They live in large traditional families in Coulou, in the commune of Kati (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nThese women have been involved in retail for several years and they receive a high demand from their customers. They buy and sell food products such as onions, peppers, cabbage and tomatoes.  Eager to meet the increasing demand of their customers, they have decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program. This is their sixth solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nTenimba, a member of the group, is a very well-known retailer in Ouelessebougou.  She is planning to use her loan to buy a large quantity of various food products.  She buys her supplies from wholesalers in Bamako and sells her goods in Ouelessebougou, on a retail basis. Her customers are both men and women and she gets paid in cash or on credit.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping to make a monthly profit of 45,000 CFA francs, which will allow her to repay her loan and to reinvest the rest of the money in her activity.

By doing so, he usually earns approximately 50,000 KES per month. <p> \r\n\r\nPaul is now seeking his third loan, this time in the amount of 110,000 KES, from VisionFund Kenya.

","en":"Kholigul is a farmer from the Yavan Region. She is 41 years old. She is an open-faced person with a clear conscience. She has two sons and one daughter. Her eldest son is 17 years old; he is currently in Russia as a migrant worker. Her daughter is 11 years old, and the youngest son is eight years old; both attend school. Kholigul's husband is a member of a cooperative farm. Kholigul has been growing farm produce for eight years. Her husband helps her in the business. At present they are busy harvesting wheat.
