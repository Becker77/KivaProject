When their daughter was little, Jyldyz obediently sat at home and looked after the child. After their daughter grew a little older, Jyldyz started to grow and sell strawberries.

and Javier started their family with many dreams and yearnings in life to offer the best to their children that they could desire to have. At the present time, this young couple work in the manufacture of coats - work that they learned in the workshop of Javier's mother.  Thanks to the effort and dedication that they put forth, they have now mastered their work and have decided to work every day of the week beginning very early in the morning.

With her first loan of 300 soles, she invested in the purchase of materials for making rope.  She has done this activity for ten years, with the help of her husband and son.  With the loan of 2,000 soles, to be repaid over four months, she will purchase 3 packages of hemp material, 2 packages of raffia, and other items.

Together with her husband, they try to provide the best care, so 30 years ago they bought a house where the entire family lives, united.  She works together with her husband, who is a carpenter, to help him in his work.  She realized she had to learn something about this work which at first was complicated, but improved with the passage of the years as her husband helped her with the fundamentals.  Together they are dedicated to providing their service of designing diverse wood products. \r\n<p>\r\nThe issue is that the two of them are not sufficient for the amount of work and they require the help of a third person so that Dina\u2019s activities can become administrative and attending to customer requests.

When the real estate bubble burst, he like many in the construction industry went from having more work than he could handle to no work at all and his license as a contractor went inactive. \r\n \r\nNow, Caleb is ready to start working on big projects again, but this time as his own boss. \u201cWhen I was working for general contractors, they weren\u2019t even around most of the time. They\u2019d leave me in charge of the crew and occasionally check in on the progress, but I was doing the work.\u201d \r\n \r\nCaleb has never taken on debt, which, until recently, seemed like a good thing. However, because he avoided things like credit cards in the past, Caleb hasn\u2019t built up a credit history. Not only does this make it difficult to secure a bank loan, but also a contractor\u2019s license. \r\n \r\n\u201cBefore the recession, [to secure a license] they\u2019d look at your performance and if there were any negative marks on your record. Now they look at your credit score, and if you don\u2019t have a credit history that license gets a lot more expensive,\u201d explained Caleb. \r\n \r\nWhen Caleb asked his bank for a small business loan to help him cover the costs of the license and insurance, which would allow him to take on a crew and larger jobs, they weren\u2019t interested in providing the small amount he needed. Instead, the bank referred him to his local microlender, Opportunity Fund, where he was approved for a $3,500 microloan. \r\n \r\nWith the loan, Caleb successfully secured his license, bond, and liability insurance. These three key elements will now help him grow his business. When asked if he had any favorite project to work on, he listed everything from elaborate door systems in Maui to decks in Marin County to old Victorian-style homes in San Francisco. \u201cI love being able to see the improvement; to look at what I\u2019ve done compared to what was there before. I like all the jobs I do, now that I think about it.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":754230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

She entered college in Berdyansk and obtained a degree in elementary education. She also gained a good understanding of people\u2019s psychology which has helped her launch her own business and attract many customers. Currently, Ludmila is a successful entrepreneur selling clothing items in one of the local markets in Berdyansk. She usually purchases inventory in bulk from Russia to resell in Ukraine. She gives preference to Russian wholesalers because their purchasing prices are relatively low, and their inventory is characterized by exceptional quality. \r\n<p>\r\nLudmila learned about \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d from her friends who have been working with our organization for many years. Her business has benefited considerably from micro-lending services since 2003 when she received her first loan.   \r\n<p>\r\nLudmila is married with a 20-year-old daughter and a grown son. She has invested her life in her family. Her personal example is the best proof that hard-work and integrity can enable one to be successful in business. Presently, Ludmila has over $4,000 in inventory. She re-stocks her clothing twice a month. Her monthly gross income amounts to $6,000, and her net profit is about $1,200. She has requested a loan of $1,200 to re-supply her inventory and increase her working capital.

In addition to her own children, she is responsible for four others. Her husband, who has no steady employment, has five wives and about 20 children. He is totally irresponsible and shows almost no concern for the welfare of his children. As a consequence, Mrs. A. lives in extreme poverty and many of her children do not attend school. In order to survive, she generates income from growing cassava. The tuberous roots of cassava are turned into tapioca that she sells at the market. The quality of her product has given her today a large clientele, but she can no longer meet their demand because she does not have enough cassava. To address this situation, she would like to buy some cassava fields to use in her production. She is therefore requesting a business loan of $700 to buy cassava and produce and sell tapioca. This will bring change to her day-to-day life.\r\n<p>\r\nAg\u00e9e de 47 ans, Madame A. Akou est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de huit (8) enfants.

Realizing that TYM Fund policy was very suitable for her family conditions, from the beginning, she borrowed 60 USD to breed pigs. By using husks wasted from the husking machine as pig mash, her breeding plan became more effective and expanded. Currently, she has 18 pigs (about 1000 kg) ready to be released with an intended profit of 2000 USD. Besides, she is investing in making ice-cream machines, and general store, etc. Therefore, her family income is very stable. Her wish is to borrow more money to expand her breeding plan and other businesses, increasing family income. This time she wants to borrow 950 USD to buy pig mash and unhusked rice.

A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time ask anxiously, \u201cbut how do you make sure people pay the loan back? Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually the \u2018poor\u2019) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people. Whether or not this is true is irrelevant for a number of reasons. Firstly, most microfinance lenders have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive: the incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026The primary incentive is to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":164451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of beer and soft drinks in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-05-28T11:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dativa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-19T01:17:10Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271835},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301087},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331821},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-24T07:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365900},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":202810,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347696}],"funded_date":"2008-06-05T01:17:10Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T03:24:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54399,"name":"Jardin Atiteca Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<P>The Jardin Atiteca community from Cerro de Oro is a very small community next to the smallest hump of a volcano in Lake Atitlan.

They then sell this piece for about 150 quetzales (20 USD) to buyers, whether intermediaries, personal contacts or shoppers in the nearby villages of Santiago de Atitlan and San Lucas. Intermediaries take the clothing and sell it to women all around the lake, including women in Panajachel, Solola and Patzun.\r\n<P>There was consensus among the group that their businesses were doing well, since they sell a type of clothing that is not produced very much within Santiago and San Lucas. This low level of competition allows them to sell almost as fast as they produce.  So the only thing keeping them from selling more is their limited capital to invest. This is why they are loyal as a group to microlenders and have rarely missed or paid late.\r\n<P>According to the women, the credit has helped their business grow. They can now buy wholesale thread, cloth and dyes. The credit not only helps them buy their materials at a cheaper price, but also helps them be able to produce more items at once. Then, with their savings, they can repay the loans bit by bit. \r\n<P>The clients emphasized that these extra sales allow their business to grow, but most importantly, allow for an increase in income which serves to pay for their children\u2019s educational needs, medicine, and clothing. In addition, this extra money allows them to continue to expand their business, while living a more comfortable life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":175165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

A matron by profession, she began trading when she was working in a municipality. When the women from this municipality wanted to organise a large festive ceremony, they sought her help. Since then and for the past ten years she has been carrying out her business and she now enjoys a large customer base and a good reputation. The strength of her sales is due to the quality of her clothes. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of coping with an order from Niger, where her clothes are much appreciated, she has turned to Soro Yiriwaso. Having already had six group loans and two individual loans, all of which were repaid on time, she is now on her third individual loan. She is planning to use this to buy 15 pieces of \"pagnes wax\" (West African highly decorative and colourful fabric). She gets her supplies in Bamako and sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up exclusively of women. She envisages making a monthly profit of 140,000 FCFA which will allow her to pay for carpets and a freezer for her daughter who is getting married. \r\n\r\nHer ambition is to buy a house to live in.

She has two years of experience in this business. Solinuu needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family. She and her husband have six children.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Solinuu joined SPBD* to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Solinuu's second loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Throughout all these years of work, Abdurahmon has been able to succeed in his business. In the future Abdurahmon is planning to have a bigger stable. He will extend the fields he cultivates.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has six female members who know each other and are neighbors.  They are:\r\n\r\n1. Araceli E. C. who will use the loan to buy skirts and blouses to stock her business\r\n\r\n2. Lul\u00fa Rodr\u00edguez Guti\u00e9rrez who is going to buy all kinds of women\u2019s cloths, pants and blouses, to stock her business\r\n\r\n3. Mitzi Yuridia B. Rodr\u00edguez who is going to buy American perfumes to sell\r\n\r\n4. Virginia C. B. who is going to buy ladies\u2019 and men\u2019s shoes at wholesale to stock her business\r\n\r\n5. Yeimi Garc\u00eda V. who is going to buy oil, sugar, eggs, milk, beans, rice, etc.  She will also buy diadems, hair rings, mirrors, little balls and rubber bands to stock her store\r\n\r\n6. Martha Lilibeth C. E. who is going to buy Tupperware items to fill her first orders \r\n\r\nMrs. Lul\u00fa Rodr\u00edguez Guti\u00e9rrez, 37, finished high school and got her diploma.  She\u2019s married and has three children: Lenis, 15, who is in high school, Jordy, 17, who is working, Mitzy, 18, who is in the university studying to become a P.E. Teacher.\r\n\r\nLul\u00fa\u2019s business is selling women\u2019s clothing.  She requested her loan to buy women\u2019s clothing.  She is going to buy blouses and pants and wants to use her profits to build an additional bedroom on her house because she does not have enough bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThe products she sells to her customers are ladies' pants and blouses.  She started the business four years ago.  Her mother taught her sales because her mother has always been a saleswoman.  She used to sell Fuller, Tupperware, clothes, and gift items.  Lul\u00fa would help her in the business and that\u2019s how she learned the business of sales.\r\n\r\nHer husband gave her money and she started to buy merchandise bit by bit.  Her business operates door to door in Jaloxtoc and Tlayecac.  She uses collective public transport to go sell her wares.  Her customers are young women.  The business is important and special because she makes profits and earns income to improve economically.\r\n\r\nHer favorite part of working in this business is that when she goes out to sell and is outdoors she meets many people and she feels very proud to sell her merchandise.  The challenge she faces in her business is lack of time because she doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to sell.  She can only go out to sell in the afternoons and on weekends.  Her business has a lot of competition.  There are a lot of door to door salespeople and street vendors.\r\n\r\nShe saves her profits to reinvest and to repay the loan.  She is planning to enlarge her business buying more denim pants to have merchandise available for her customers.  She is very happy with the loan she will get because she\u2019s given the opportunity to borrow money to stock her business.  Besides, as we mentioned before, she wants to make some home improvements.\r\n\r\nIn Tlayecac, April 25 is San Marcos Tlayecac Day.  Masses are celebrated, there\u2019s a fair, dancing, Brinco de Chinelos (traditional indigenous dance from the state of Morelos).  There\u2019s also a very pretty hill that seems close by.  They grow sorghum.\r\n\r\nThis business has helped her cover the children\u2019s transportation costs and to help with household expenses.  It will also help to make the home improvements; she wants to add a bedroom she needs.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to continue selling, to make the improvements she wants for her children\u2019s future, to continue working so that they can continue with their studies and this loan will help her invest in clothes.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad:  \u201cWe thank you for thinking of us and facilitating the loans to people like us who need them.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":659849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy women's pants and blouses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLAYECAC MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-08T18:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lulu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mitzi Yuridia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Lilibeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":378.56,"local_amount":4719.72,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4733.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691525},{"amount":412.97,"local_amount":5148.72,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5163.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430708},{"amount":630.58,"local_amount":7861.72,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":7884.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849983},{"amount":502.89,"local_amount":6269.84,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6288.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292255}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T19:23:10Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":260134,"name":"\u00c1ngel Ramiro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngel Ramiro P.

Donald started with 300 dollars of his own money and without the support of anyone else.  In search of a better life, he began working in the free trade zone in the capital of Managua.  He did not have any luck and was not able to achieve the financial progress that he had hoped.  Donald then made the decision to work in his own business.  Prior to selling mobile phones, he started his business by selling records.  However, he discovered that selling mobile phone accessories would be better since he already had good relationships with the distributors at the eastern market in the city of Managua.  \r\n\r\nDonald is requesting a loan to be used as operating capital so that he can buy more accessories and lenses.

They have two children, aged 22 and 29. In her community of Gaviotas she sells soft drinks and alcoholic drinks. It is a business through which she is able to support her household.\r\n\r\nRocio worked previously as the manager of a laundry shop but for health reasons she left her employment. Her husband and children insisted. Later, when she had recovered, she decided to start out her own adventure, selling beer. She started out with only one case but later she added some music and her sales volume increased. She also started to sell beauty products, vitamins, accessories through specialized catalogues. She sold to various companies, her husband's work colleagues, friends, neighbors, and to references. Gradually she has increased both businesses, taking advantage of every opportunity for simultaneous sales. She wants to increase her working capital to purchase cases of beer in greater quantities, nutrition products, and to carry out repairs to the flooring outside of her business.

Some time ago, school became too great a financial burden for her parents and they could no longer afford to spend so much on the materials she needed.  For this reason, Maria del Carmen began to purchase small home electronics (such as those shown behind her in the photograph) at wholesale, and offering them for sale to her fellow students.  She uses the funds she earns toward her educational expenses.<p>\r\n\r\nShe needs to buy more products given that, during this season, her type of merchandise is in great demand.  She requests a loan of $750USD, to be repaid over a period of six months.  With the earnings from her sales, Maria del Carmen hopes to save enough to buy a small holiday gift for her parents to show them her appreciation.  The rest of her earnings would go toward finishing her education, and meeting her goal of one day becoming a person who does well.  With your help, Maria del Carmen will be able to finish her studies.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>   \r\n\r\nMa.

He dreams of buying a house in Le\u00f3n where he could take his family on vacation, as his current home is in the Ch\u00e1caraseca region.\r\n\r\nGerm\u00e1n works fattening pigs and raising chickens.  His business is located in his home in the Ch\u00e1caraseca region, and he has had the business for 10 years.  He began with another business before starting his current business.  In his previous business, he was a truck driver who transported TIP-TOP poultry.  He began with 10 chickens, and because he is a hard-working person, he also began with two pigs and wanted to invest in more pigs.  He continued buying pigs until he had 30 in total, and this was how, little by little, he increased his production until he had what he has now.  This loan is for working capital that will be used to buy more chickens and animal feed so the development of his pigs and chickens can be of better quality for fattening his animals.  He sells more chickens than any other animal, and they are sold alive and by the pound.  He hopes to continue receiving the help of Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and their sister organizations.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":253191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy chickens and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T08:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"German Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399976},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091974},{"amount":52.77,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985358},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445974},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956615},{"amount":211.11,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4211.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174043}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T14:59:12Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Westin","image":54967}},{"id":87218,"name":"Sam-Ang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miss.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and a pig fattening business. Her 40 year old husband, Ledeganio C., works as a carpenter to earn his living and he also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children, 13 to 18 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000. She intends to use the funds as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the family's future, to be able to afford a good education for their children and to fight the daily battle of their lives. Ma.

F. has a store in the town of Puerto Colombia.  This is a small coastal town which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was home to the most important shipping port in the country.  This small businesswoman is a hairdresser by profession and, over many years, she worked in several beauty salons.  Five years ago her husband, who was a salesman in an electrical appliance store, lost his job and this was when the idea to create her own business was born.\r\n\r\nAt first, the store was not very well stocked with foodstuffs but, over time, it improved.  Janeth also acquired display cases, shelves and refrigerators.  Now she divides her time between her trade as a shopkeeper and her hairdressing services which she offers in people's homes.\r\n\r\nThis is Janeth's third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to invest the money in buying general foodstuffs.  She has always been noted for her excellent punctuality.  Her business has a monthly sales volume of 5,000,000 Colombian pesos and her average profit margin is 20%.  Janeth plans, next year, to rent larger premises so that she can transfer her store and adapt the self-service system.  She says that she enjoys her business as a shopkeeper a lot because it allows her to be in permanent contact with the neighbors in her community.  Her greatest satisfaction is not the money that her small business makes but rather the appreciation that her customers all show

She lives with Nerio, 33, and their 5 children in a house that they own in Nueva Esperanza, a town in Quimbiri.  Hilda and Nerio support the family.  Hilda has been a farmer--work that she learned from her parents--since she was a girl.  She owns 4 hectares of land where she grows coffee, achiote and coca, all plants native to the Rio Apurimac valley in the Peruvian Amazon.  She started working the land for herself 17 years ago.  At harvest time, she can count on the help of both her children and temporary day laborers who she needs to get her crop in quickly.  Hilda likes harvesting her crops because the harvest is her reward for many months of working hard to grow the very best crop she can.  The most difficult thing about the business, she says, is getting the crop from her fields to the market in the town of San Francisco where she can get the best price for her crop.  Her immediate problem is that she doesn't have the equipment she needs to process her coffee beans.  She is applying to MFP for a loan to buy the equipment she needs.  She has 2 hectares of uncultivated land and, in the future, she wants to plant more coffee there.  This is Hilda's first MFP loan.

Mwanne has been running her crop business since 2002.  \n\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Mwanne currently earns about $45 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $425 USD to purchase more rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to expand her business by adding more quantity and range of the stock . Mwanne thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

This single 46 year old woman is the mother of 6 children, 1 of whom she still supports. She has always been characterized by her spirit of perseverance and her desire to progress through her own efforts. This has lead her to open her own business selling kebabs - something she has done for 5 years.  Her business is located in the front of the Plaza in  a well placed spot with good foot traffic. Little by little she endeared herself to her customers, and now she reports a strong business. Currently she continues in the same business, and she is very pleased with her job. With this 2,000 sol loan she will purchase basic ingredients including bags of rice, eggs, Creole chickens for making \u201cjuanes\u201d (traditional Peruvian dish of cassava, rice, and meat steamed in a banana leaf), and cooking utensils so that she can provide high quality service and replace her old ones.
