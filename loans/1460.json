She lives with her husband Md. Fajlar and two children in the village of Bhemtia. She did not complete her secondary education due to her parents' monetary problems but she is dedicated to providing a good education for her children. They are attending their school regularly and studying in grade I.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer who cultivates different types of vegetables and sells them in the local market. Being a housewife, she manages all the household work and then assists her husband with the farming activities. Both of them work hard to take care of their family but are unable to provide sufficient income.\r\n\r\nLutfa wants to extend her helping hands to her husband. She has decided to cultivate jute on her farmland, as it is a most important profitable crop. She thinks this will be a lucrative business because jute fibers are commonly used in making ropes, bags, sacs, canvass, gunny bags, twine, carpets, curtains, twining threads and covers for cotton bales. \r\n\r\nShe has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase jute seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation as soon as possible.  She is very hopeful to earn a profit from this new cultivation, which will help her to reach to her goals of giving a decent lifestyle to her family and educating her children to establish them in life. \r\n\r\nLutfa and her husband are very much thankful to the lenders (BJS and Kiva) for giving them the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1628181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase jute seeds, fertilizers and pesticides ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-06-22T07:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-22T07:30:07Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lutfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-23T18:05:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":724701,"name":"Mujiza Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Kibandja est une commer\u00e7ante et membre d\u2019une plate forme  d\u2019affaires  \u00abMujiza\u00bb, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 50 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re des 5 enfants dont 3 \u00e9tudient et 2 autres sont mari\u00e9s.

She lives with her husband Bhanu and two children in the small village of Barmanpara in Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri. She studied up to sixth grade but could not study further due to the financial crisis of her family.  Her husband is a carpenter. One of her children has completed up to grade 10 and the other one is working as a mason due to their monetary problems. \r\n\r\nManju's husband has no permanent income and it is very difficult to run the family smoothly. So, Manju has been working in animal husbandry for five years. She is a hardworking lady and has the courage to get ahead in life. She keeps the faith in her own ability. She has a milk cow and she sells milk in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, she wants to purchase a cow and for that, she needs money.

Despite the fact that the store is not very well stocked, her profits have been very good and she hopes to use the new loan to increase her inventory.  She works every day and her daughters help out when they get home from school.  Thanks to her earnings she has been able to cover her daughters' school expenses, since her husband does not earn much.\r\n\r\nLucia plans to use this loan to buy rice, sugar, canned goods and other products to increase store inventory.  She has been a member of the loan group for two loan cycles and hopes to continue a long time because the loans are very helpful.

Her embroidery patterns are very popular on her street and she is the best-earning resource in her household. She is a mother of five children; all of whom are in school. She wants to grow her business, so she requested a loan of 40,000 PKR to buy raw materials such as thread, sequins and pearls in large quantities to meet the increasing demand. She shared her dream of running a training center for girls of her town. She is also interested in opening her own shop in the market to display her work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1628155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

However, her biggest business challenges are the poor road network and the lack of market.  \r\n\r\nLillian is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cow shed.  Her loan will help her to significantly improve the health and hygiene or her animals. Constructing a cow shed will also come in handy when she scales up and introduces zero-grazing. The long-term impact of her loan will be an increase in productivity and improved animal health. Lillian will use the income from her loan to provide for her children\u2019s education. She is striving to improve her family\u2019s quality of life by constantly increasing her income.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

","en":"Muzaffar is 58 years old, and is a good family man with four children. Muzaffar raises cattle, and every morning he sends his cattle to pasture so they eat and return in the evening. They live in the countryside. To support the family, all family members try to earn money somehow. Everyone contributes, however they are able. Muzaffar works with livestock and crop production. He earns a good income from this business.  He also grows grapes in his small garden. Although this is a seasonal business, it brings him additional income.\r\n\r\nBreeding and selling livestock is Muzaffar's core, stable business. His wife and children help him with the business by taking care of the cattle and selling the milk.  Because livestock provides such a good and stable income, Muzaffar wants to expand his business. He needs to buy a few additional cattle for breeding and resale. To achieve this, Muzaffar asked MDO Arvand for a loan to purchase cattle. He hopes that this expansion will successfully bring more profit to and improve quality of life for his family. Muzaffar thanks MDO Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1619647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"kostakos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-06-22T14:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-22T14:50:09Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muzaffar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.04,"local_amount":68.04,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":68.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517585805},{"amount":931.96,"local_amount":931.96,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":931.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530081385}],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T08:14:19Z","paid_date":"2014-09-19T10:12:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Max Prilutsky","image":1270958}},{"id":726334,"name":"Elisee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisee is 44 years old.

She has decided to cultivate jute in her farm land as it is a most important and profitable crop and so she thinks this will be a lucrative business because jute fibers are commonly used in making ropes, bags, sacs, canvas, gunny bags, twine, carpets, curtains, twining threads and covers for cotton bales. \r\n\r\nShe has taken the loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase jute seeds and fertilizers to start cultivation as early as possible.

She has been practicing this activity for 15 years. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will help her to buy 3 sacks of flour, 2 cartons of powdered milk, 2 sacks of sugar, 2 cartons of wine, 3 cartons of juice, 5 cartons of spring water, 60 litres of oil, some cookies, candy, etc. \r\n\r\nHer goals are to bolster her capital, feed her children and provide for their education. \r\n\r\nBahati wishes to thank Hekima for helping to empower small business owners who cannot use the traditional banking system, especially in these post-war times in the Eastern region. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8900,"image":{"id":1625775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy 3 sacks of flour, 2 cartons of powdered milk, 2 sacks of sugar, 2 cartons of wine, 3 cartons of juice, 5 cartons of spring water, 60 liters of oil, some cookies, candy, etc. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She did not go to school because she didn't have the opportunity; back then, the area where she lived with her parents was quite affected by the civil war suffered by her country at that time. Her parents worked in corn and bean farming and she, along with her sisters, helped them every day in order to have food. She married 25 years ago and her husband works in beekeeping, a business in which he has a great deal of experience and which he really likes. She is the mother of one son who also works as an assistant in a mechanic's shop.\r\n\r\nArmida has had a small general store for 26 years. When she was getting married, she started her small business to support her husband and strive with him to earn economic income in order to have a good quality of life. In addition, she helps her husband sell honey from their house, a business that she also knows very well; she is in charge of sales.\r\n\r\nFor four years, she has also sold lingerie, earning additional income for her family. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan from CrediCampo in order to buy three beehives. She also needs to buy more everyday household staples to offer to her customers in the community. That way, she will be able to have more economic income for her family.\r\n\r\nArmida dreams of increasing their beehives little by little in order to have greater honey production and sell more products. She also wants for her husband to have his own commercial brand in the market. \r\n\r\nIn addition, she wants to expand her shop to have more products to offer to her customers, since in the community where she lives, there are not many stores; that would enable her to have more sources of income.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1626315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase three beehives.

","en":"Oyniso has worked with baking, in her region of Jilikul, for more than 15 years already. She is professional in her work. Oyniso works with baking and selling sambusa - filled pies, the national dish. Her husband and sons also work with her at the bakery.\r\n\r\n Oyniso has five children between the ages of 7 and 23. Everyone in the region knows their family and they have returning customers.

She manages her family's household, but also sells tortillas and on weekends goes to the town plaza to sell tamales. \r\n\r\nMery was raised by hardworking and humble parents, who had a business selling tortillas and bread. Mery's family worked at this business every day, which allowed them to meet their basic needs and achieve some success. Mery was the oldest child, so she was responsible for the various household tasks and also for sales for the family business. It was therefore difficult for her to finish elementary school, and she only attended through the third grade. When Mery grew up, she married a farmer, and the couple has two sons and a daughter. Two of the children attend the national school, but the youngest is not yet old enough to start school. \r\n\r\nMery has been responsible for managing a household, her parents' or her own, for 31 years. She has sold tortillas on weekdays and  bread on weekends for the past ten years, and plans to keep doing so. Bread and tortilla sales have become her main source of income and her means of meeting her children's basic needs. Mery's daughter helps her in the afternoons after she leaves her morning school session.  \r\n\r\nMery will use the funds from this loan to purchase a refrigerator and a food display case, which will replace old appliances that are reaching the end of their service lives. Mery has also begun selling other foods and is trying to improve her business, offer better service to her customers, and boost her income. \r\n\r\nMery's dreams and aspirations for the future are to pay off this loan, apply for another one in order to expand her food business, and support her children through their university studies. Her sons are studying to become agronomists and her daughter wants to become a nurse. Mery and her children will be able to fulfill their aspirations with his loan and the investment of her earnings.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1626351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase a refrigerator and food display case.

His parents taught him how to do this when he was quite young as it was the only form of work and source of income at that time. So he farms. Besides his crops he also buys and sells cattle as another activity to generate funds for the family. It takes him one hour to walk to the land he works. His wife and children help him with his work. <br \/><br \/>The loan he is requesting is to buy fertilizer, manure and to pay for labor to grow corn and beans. The loan will help him to satisfy the need to grow his crops in an efficient, adequate and timely manner without the complication of crop loss.

He would also like to obtain higher production with his basic grains and live comfortably in a dignified place with his children.

He chose this crop because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nIn Azerbaijan, people use fresh vegetables daily and consider them healthy. Many national dishes, such as pilau and dolma, are made of vegetables. Fresh fruits are served at every family's table and are also used to make fresh punch. \r\n\r\nNabi  usually sells his crop in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 80 AZN. As his products are in high demand, he wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables. He has therefore applied for a loan of 600 AZN to buy new garden tools, seeds, and fertilizers.

years old. She only studied through first grade because when she was in school, the schools were far away and because of the distance she couldn't walk to the school, so her parents opted not to have her study. She is single and has 2 children, one who is 19 years old and another who is 24 years old. The youngest studied through high school and the oldest only studied through ninth grade. They both work. Three people live in her house--her two sons and herself.\r\n\r\nRosaura works in the home and also, because she is a single mother, she has to work in agriculture. She plants basic grains such as corn and beans. She explains that when she was young, her father took her to work and that is how she learned this business. When she had her children, in order to support them she had to work in agriculture. She says that her sons help her when they have time. After taking care of her housework, she works on her crops. She says she doesn't have a work schedule because of the fact that she has two occupations. The land where she has her crops is close to her house, so the distance to get there isn't far. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy pesticides and corn seed. She also wants to buy a refrigerator so she can better conserve her food.\r\n\r\nRosaura wants to improve her house in the future, so that she can live comfortably with her sons. She also wants to be able to help her sons continue studying so they can go to university and have better jobs and live better."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1626385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

At an amount of PHP 50,000, she could already purchase more quantities and varieties of fruit, veggies and other items needed to expand her inventory. She also plans to add more quantities of snacks, seasonings and condiments for her additional income.

his wife and two children.  He earns a living as a contractor, specifically doing tile work, plastering, and redecorating.  He plans to continue his business in order to save money for his children's education.  Mikhail is very punctual, and has always monitored his income and expenses.  Mikhail dreams of completely redoing his own house and improving the living conditions in his home.  Not long ago he changed all of the windows in his home, but he lacks the funds to finish the repair process.  Mikhail would really like to replace his doors, lay tile in the hallway and kitchen, and redo the floor in the living room.  The implementation of his plans requires a sum of 30,000 UAH.

He needs to walk a kilometer in the morning and one in the afternoon every day of the week. \r\n\r\nFor the last four years, he has also had a small chicken farm, which for the last three years has been tended to by his wife. He also works in agriculture when he is able to devote time during the week. He grows 7,000 square meters of corn to bring the harvest to his family and that way he no longer needs to buy grain.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he will buy pesticides and fertilizers to apply to his harvests. By buying them all at once, he will be able to apply them to the plants on time and that way he expects to have a good production of basic grains.\r\n\r\nFor his future, he wants to build a better infrastructure for his home to live comfortably with his family in a decent place and also wishes to have a good production of basic grains to ensure sustenance for his family.

She now has to her name 1 milk cow, 1 calf, and 2.0 hectares of land, on which she planted corn and wheat last year.  This year, however, Aigulya plans to grow cotton.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.  With the goal of further expanding her business, Aigulya turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 15,000 KGS to purchase fertilizer and pesticides to cultivate the land.

","en":"Ismoil is from Qubadiyon and has a small business. He is 50 years old and has his own flour mill close to home. Residents of his village and the surrounding area visit him in order to grind their wheat. He has been in this business for 6 years. Now that he has plenty of experience, he has decided to expand his small business. He wants to provide an additional service--namely, processing rice. Because electricity in his area is low and frequently cuts out, he also plans to buy a generator to supply power to his shop. Ismoil needs a loan because he does not have enough money. He is requesting a loan of $4000 to buy the equipment to process rice in addition to a generator. Thanks to the loan he will be able to purchase this equipment and his business will grow more successful and more profitable. He hopes for financial support.

She is a married woman and supports her family with a poultry business (layer). She grows up to 280 chickens now.  This is the benefit she experienced from Kiva, since she was growing only 200 chickens before. Rose also sells beauty products such as lotions and other cosmetics door to door. She has been in these projects for a period of four years now and is able to make a fair monthly profit. She runs her business from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm daily.\r\n\r\nThis is her 16th loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans (all of which were paid back successfully) to increase laying chickens (200 to 280) and bought beauty items to resell. She is so proud with Kiva's support. Rose earned a profit which she used to cover school fees, home food expenses and saved for an investment purpose (to open her new retail shop). With her 16th loan, she will use it to open her new project of retail shop (to purchase sacks of sugar,cooking oil, maize and baking flour, etc.). In the coming years, Rose would like to improve her life and build a nice family house. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"Mt Ulunguru\", which totals two members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
