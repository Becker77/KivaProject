She will use her loan to buy a bale of second-hand clothing.\r\n\r\nKamondo hopes to be able to use her profits to educate, clothe, feed and provide healthcare for her children.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Hekima for helping women entrepreneurs, who are excluded from the classic banking system, to become independent.  This is especially important during this post-conflict period in the east of the country."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":1627136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy a bale of second-hand clothing for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

They cannot fulfill their dream due to lack of capital.\r\n\r\nSo Pramila has applied for a loan from BJS to purchase jute seeds and other necessary things related to cultivation.

The income he makes from milk, tea and egg sales is insufficient to meet expenses of his family of six children. Hence he decided to start dairy entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nRichard is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cowshed. With your loan, the cowshed will enable Richard to introduce zero-grazing, by which he projects he will be producing more than 20 litres of milk per day to be sold. This will generate enough money to pay for the loan and still have more for saving.\r\n\r\nRichard can\u2019t wait to start making real profits from dairy farming. Currently, his biggest challenge is limited funds. Richard is very appreciative of Juhudi Kilimo and its partners like Kiva who are there to support smallholder farmers. He plans to plough the extra money he will make back into the business and purchase better quality cows. He says his family will greatly benefit from the increased income. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1629199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a cowshed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-23T13:50:35Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-23T13:50:35Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3771.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4446.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4566.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4730.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4817.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4979.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5080.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5217.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5416.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5504.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5662.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5805.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.21,"local_amount":9617.78,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":9834.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570926},{"amount":51.89,"local_amount":4447.56,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4548,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054295},{"amount":56.96,"local_amount":4882.26,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4992.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547472},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":5001.07,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5114.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680441},{"amount":57.21,"local_amount":4903.44,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5014.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624730},{"amount":61.16,"local_amount":5242.08,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5360.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193804},{"amount":302.22,"local_amount":25905.81,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":26490.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261767}],"funded_date":"2014-07-05T08:12:53Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":726785,"name":"Jean Bosco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Bosco is 29 years old.

They live in Maynaguri in the district Jalpaiguri.  Both are illiterate, able to sign their names only, and did not get the opportunity to study due to their parents' poverty. Both the sons are working as daily laborers.\r\n \r\nKusumbala's husband has always worked in agriculture. He is the only earning member for the family and always strives for the betterment of his family.  Kusumbala, though a housewife, helps her husband in his agricultural activities. They mainly cultivate seasonal vegetables and fruits and sell them in the local market. But it is difficult for them to run a family of four members in a decent way with such a small income. They thought to expand their business and start cultivation of jute, which is a profitable crop, but they cannot fulfill their dream due to lack of capital.\r\n\r\nSo Kusumbala has applied for a loan from BJS to purchase jute seeds and other necessary things related to cultivation. She hopes it will be a lucrative business and will provide them with much profit to give her family financial stability. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of making improvements to her house and, in future, upgrading her house to a concrete one.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to Kiva and BJS.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1629179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To start cultivation of jute.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-06-23T13:50:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-23T13:50:36Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kusumbala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-23T16:28:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":726789,"name":"Saripin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saripin lives in Purwokerto, a semi-urban area about 10 hours from Jakarta.

He studied up to sixth grade. He is married and his wife works in domestic chores. He has one son; therefore, Oscar has only his wife and son as dependents. Oscar has worked for 22 years as a mason. He learned this job when he worked as an assistant to another mason. Also, he works in agriculture. He grows a hectare of corn, and he also cultivates watermelons. These activities have allowed him to move his family forward. His work schedule is from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and he works the land between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. He will use the loan to pay for the people, who will help him clean the watermelon field, and to buy fertilizers and foliar fertilizers to help him have a better production. His plans for the future are to make himself know through his masonry jobs in other communities, so that he can have more work. Also, he wants to get a good harvest of watermelons so he can pay for his committed loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1627475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay the people, who will help him clean the watermelon field, to buy fertilizers and foliar fertilizers.

She lives with a partner and he works as a driver for a private firm. They have two children, one aged 5 who is in the first grade at school and a 3-year-old who does not go to school yet. Just the four of them live in the house and their children are their only direct dependents. \r\n\r\nFor the last 2 years Roxana has made a living as a distributor of products for small neighbourhood shops. This all began because her sister worked for a company and, thanks to her, she started buying products and distributing them to shops.

This will help her serve her customers better.

After getting married, she and her husband decided to come back and raise their family in the country.

From this, she was able to set up a small general store. In January 2014, she came to know about SEED through a friend and decided to join. She availed a first loan amounting to PhP 7,000 and used the amount to purchase canned goods for her store.\n\nOn her second loan, Edwina wants to buy bottled purified water and soda drinks for her store. She would also want to add up to her investment in the electronic load for mobile phones. These are highly demanded commodities in her area and she would like to take advantage of selling those items.\n\nShe knows life is is difficult in the country but would not want either her or her husband to be overseas workers again. She values her hands-on experience raising her children while doing business at the same time. With perseverance, Edwina hopes to see all her four children finishing school.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1632546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy bottled purified water and soda drinks for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cavite City, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2014-06-23T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-23T16:10:06Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":731.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504391720},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517668526},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530170466},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":731.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650142},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":731.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650143},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":731.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650144},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":731.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650145},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":731.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650146},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-09T11:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":731.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561784610}],"funded_date":"2014-06-23T20:38:06Z","paid_date":"2014-12-09T11:08:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":729030,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lolita, at 54, is still very much hands-on in her general store business.

at 32, has five children, of which one is already in college and three are studying in high school. Even as her husband works as an overseas contract worker in the Middle East, she is compelled to engage in business by the growing needs of her family specially in terms of educational expenses.\n\nIn 2009, she started selling consigned cosmetics, apparel and footwear products. From her earnings and commissions, Rowena opened a small store in their house. With business needs increasing, Rowena contemplated on availing microloans but was dismayed with the interest rates offered. In 2012, her friend invited her to join SEED and she was eventually approved to avail a loan. From then on, Rowena was able to improve her business. From her last loan, she was able to have a separate store space constructed from an extension lot in their house.\n\nOn her 6th loan, Rowena is planning to buy rice, sugar, cooking oil and processed meat products. These commodities are in demand with the opening of the school year in June. Often, to economize, families are preparing packed lunch for their children who are going to school as what Rowena also does for her children.\n\nRowena hopes that with her business, she will be able to assist her husband in meeting the needs of their family and specially in supporting the education of their children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1632620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, sugar, cooking oil, and processed meat products for her store which are in demand in preparing student's packed lunch.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Trece Martires, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2014-06-23T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-23T16:10:06Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rowena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.44,"local_amount":5411.76,"processed_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-07-17T17:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5669.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":504391721},{"amount":161.75,"local_amount":6764.7,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7086.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517668527},{"amount":129.4,"local_amount":5411.76,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5669.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530170467},{"amount":32.35,"local_amount":1352.94,"processed_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1417.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650147},{"amount":32.35,"local_amount":1352.94,"processed_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1417.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650148},{"amount":32.35,"local_amount":1352.94,"processed_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1417.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650149},{"amount":32.36,"local_amount":1352.96,"processed_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1417.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650150}],"funded_date":"2014-06-24T02:00:42Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":729153,"name":"Ramil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramil and his family hails from Capiz.

35 years old, married and with four children lives in a coastal community in Naic, Cavite. Her husband works as a fisherman. To help with the needs of the family, Jenillin set up a small store in 2004 selling mostly canned goods and grocery items which are in demand in the community. \n\nAs earnings of fisherfolks rely on the sales of the produce, Jenillin's store has been exposed to a higher level of credit sales. Of which, she will only be able to collect at the end of the day or on a weekly basis. However difficult the situation, Jenillin managed to sustain her business for 10 years now. Jenillin makes sure that she only provide credit to neighbors with good repayment habits and stable fishing activities.\n\nIn January 2014, Jenillin was invited by a friend to join SEED. After having successfully passed the process, she was able to get a PhP 7,000 loan which she used to primarily purchase fishing net and the rest to refurbish stocks of canned goods from her store. \n\nOn her second loan now, Jenillin wants to buy additional stocks of rice, sugar, milk and coffee in bigger volume. These would help her support the needs of her customers which is an advantage over going to the market in the town

sustain their family's needs through her businesses.\n\nBefore bearing a child, Gelyn used to work in a factory at the Export Processing Zone in Cavite. With motherhood, she decided to resign and set up her own business so she can personally attend to the needs of her daughter. For four years now, Gelyn has been cooking and selling fried chicken. \n\nTo start up her business and to address her business needs from time to time, Gelyn resorts to availing credit under usurious interest terms (20% interest for a 40-day loan term). While terms are difficult, Gelyn manages her debts by ensuring proper loan use for business and with the support of her husband who works as a cab driver.

His spouse Simona also helps with their agriculture.   \nIt is clear that Fabian and Simona work hard to maintain their family and at night, after a hard day of work, the conditions in the house are not very good due to the lack of electricity.   The family currently illuminates their home with kerosene lamps the electrical utility grid does not reach this rural area.  The kerosene lamps, which must be lit by striking a match, produce substantial contamination in the house, present a risk of fire and produce a very low level of lighting. \nHe mentioned that he hopes to improve the security of his family and help the children study with electric lighting.  To improve living conditions for his family, Fabian is requesting a loan to purchase a complete solar electric system from Soluz Honduras.  With this system the illumination in the house will be with highly efficient and long life LED lamps.  With electrical light it is much easier to study and other activities are much more pleasant, such as cooking in the kitchen or gathering the family at the dinner table or in the living room. The solar electric system can power a television and radio which provide entertainment, news and education in this rural area providing better access to information from within the country and around the world. The system can also maintain the charge in a cellular telephone to allow essential communications from this rural area.\nIn addition to the reduction of toxic fumes from kerosene lamps, the solar electric system reduces the family\u2019s energy costs by eliminating the cost of kerosene, the cost of dry cell batteries for radios and the cost of cell phone charging with related cost of transport to an urban center for charging.  These savings will provide Fabian a return on his investment in the solar electric system.  The solar panel has a 25 year warranty. Soluz Honduras installs, guarantees, and maintains the system to assure that the benefits will continue for many years. \nA positive global environmental impact of this investment is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (0.25 tons per year) that results from the elimination of kerosene consumption\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1632048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a solar energy Systema for his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":390,"posted_date":"2014-06-23T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-23T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12584,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1175.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1193.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1211.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1229.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1247.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1285.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1304.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1324.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1344.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.95},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.92,"local_amount":1175.78,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.15,"payment_id":517676350},{"amount":63.57,"local_amount":1193.42,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:26:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1222.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":530183477},{"amount":64.24,"local_amount":1211.32,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1241.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":542658326},{"amount":65.26,"local_amount":1229.49,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":561792685},{"amount":66.72,"local_amount":1247.93,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1278.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.22,"payment_id":579753892},{"amount":136.9,"local_amount":2552.3,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2614.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595318499},{"amount":68.73,"local_amount":1304.93,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1336.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.27,"payment_id":624392601},{"amount":137.35,"local_amount":2668.83,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2734.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.81,"payment_id":636462386}],"funded_date":"2014-06-24T14:34:11Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":726895,"name":"Cathy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cathy lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Meet James, a 36-year-old husband, father and farmer from Eldoret. His 1.5-acre farm is located at Lelmokwo location, which is close to the homes of world-class marathon runners. For four years now, he has been practicing horticulture and poultry farming for a living, with the help of family members and one employee.\r\n \r\nJames is seeking a loan to purchase a Fresian dairy cow. This cow produces more than 15 litres of milk daily. Income from milk sales is enough to repay the loan and save some money comfortably.\r\n\r\nJames believes hard work and determination will bear him fruit. He projects that, eventually, dairy farming will outperform all other activities. By virtue of his background, he has an upper-hand in running the livestock business. \u201cTo become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nMake James\u2019 dream come true. He enjoys physical work and handling dairy animals. He is very realistic about the scale of his operation. His dream is to produce farm-fresh milk and dairy products for friends and neighbours. His family will benefit from the modest profits he will

He is currently married and lives in his house with his wife and two of his daughters, since his other children have started their own families and live in other places.  One of the children that lives with him is in the last semester of a university degree in marketing and the other attended school through third grade.  His wife cares for their home.  His wife and two daughters are the only ones who live with him.\r\n\r\nVictoriano has worked as a farmer since he was a child since he did not have the opportunity to attend school.  His parents sent him to work in the fields, so he learned as a child to work hard and move forward with the household expenses.  In addition, he has also worked for many years caring for livestock.  He buys and sells them and also keeps them to make dairy products.  He works as a farmer alone, since his wife does the housework together with his daughter while his other daughter is studying.  They are a very united family.  He has to get up at 4:00am to milk the livestock and feed them to go to work where he has his crops.  Every day of the week he always does the same routine to bring his family food and give them better living conditions.\r\n\t\r\nHe will use this loan to purchase a dairy cow to extract milk and process it to later sell its derivatives.  This will allow him to have extra income in his wallet so that he can give his family a better life.  His life will improve since he has another asset in his house and he will have dairy production which added to what he has, will generate more income than what he has now.  Having the money on time will allow him to purchase the livestock at a good price.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that in the future his daughter will be able to graduate with honors and find a good job in her field.  He also hopes to make improvements to his home to make it larger, since he thinks that when his daughters get married, they will live with him so he can see his grandchildren grow up.  He will teach them to do farm work so that they can also succeed in life and support their households when they start them.  He hopes that all of his efforts will be appreciated by his family and remembered by them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1626412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He has excellent moral values, and he is well-known in his community for being a person who is very devoted to serving others and for having good manners.  This has caused him to be very well-respected by his neighbors and other people in the community.\n\nHe lives with his family; his wife, who does the household chores; a daughter; and two grandchildren.\n\nHe is a farmer, and he grows basic grains like corn, beans, and sorghum.  He grew up with his father, and he has a fourth grade education.  The reason that he did not continue his education was the lack of financial resources.  His school was far away, and as time passed he acquired experience and a lot of knowledge about agriculture.  This is the business activity that has now become his main source of income.\n\nHe sells almost 50% of his harvest.  The rest is for his family\u2019s consumption.  The place where he works is three kilometers from his house.  He does this work, and he is helped by ones of his children from the hours of 6:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m.  This is because he goes to the community school in the afternoon.\n\nHe will use the loan to buy fertilizers, which will be used on his corn and bean crops.  It is now the planting season, and fertilizer needs to be applied in order to have a better production and to bring daily sustenance to his family.\n\nThe goals that he has for the future are to expand and diversify his crops.

On average, they are 36 years old and have 6 children. They all live in Djelibougou, one of the neighborhoods of Bamako. They know one another through parental ties, neighborhood relations, and their revenue-making businesses. The members of the group sell vegetables (cucumbers and lettuce), peanuts, tubers, and smoked fish. In the interest of building up their inventory, the members of the group decided to appeal to Soro Yiriwaso and are on their third group loan cycle. Ms. Adiaratou (the woman seated in the center of the photo) has a good reputation in the sale of vegetables (cucumbers and lettuce).

She used the previous credit to buy the missed food cooking ingredients. Upendo paid back the loan successfully. She earned a profit which she used to add to her building costs.

Two are in school, and the other two are still small. He is in his thirties and married with two wives. \r\n\r\nHe supports his life with three businesses. Mussa has two fishing boats which he has handed over to his two helpers who fish at night and take the stock to him everyday. He wakes up in the morning after his two boats arrive and sells the stock to small business clients at the market. He also leave aside a few buckets for his fried fish business. \r\n\r\nDespite having no education, he is still able to manage his projects well. He has been in this fishing business for 15 years. \r\n\r\nAfter managing his fish business well, Mussa came up with a new business, a shop selling CDs, fridges, freezers, and TVs. \r\n\r\nMussa is requesting a ninth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used the previous loans to open his shop selling CDs, TVs, decks, freezers, and fridges. He earned a profit which he used to plow back to his plan and built four houses, two for living and the others for renting. He has successfully paid back all of his previous loans.\r\n\r\nHe is really working hard and it shows. He dreams of having a farm and starting a poultry business. Mussa will use this loan to buy used boat equipment. \r\n\r\nHe will share this loan with his loan group \"Vigae\" which totals two members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan. \r\n\r\nMussa is so proud to have Kiva's support and thanks everyone who has supported people around the world.

They also refer their friends to Freddy, who then become customers. This is why Freddy's business is growing and why more and more he needs to offer a greater variety of products. Freddy sells both on a cash basis and on credit, and he buys his inventory on credit from wholesalers that offer him discounts.\r\n\r\nFreddy's parents also have their own business, a small store selling soft drinks. They encouraged Freddy to start his business so that he would have his own income when he finished high school. That is exactly what he did two years ago, when he started selling a few items such as notebooks, pens and other stationery. Today, his sales show no signs of slowing down. Freddy's goal is to grow his business by buying more inventory. He would like to earn more income so that he can continue in his profession. So far he has learned marketing, sales and cross-border trade, but he would like to go further.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Freddy's first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo (FMSD). He will use the loan to buy stationery supplies, clothing and home accessories. This loan will allow Freddy to overcome one of his greatest challenges, which is to obtain resources so that he can invest in more inventory, increase his sales and earn more income, all of which would make this loan a success."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1627503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stationery supplies, clothing and home accessories to sell in his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-06-23T22:10:39Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-23T22:10:39Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68735},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76047},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78328},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80678},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83099},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85592},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88159},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90804},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93528},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96334},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99224},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":109472}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Graham Robinson","image":null}},{"id":727118,"name":"Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esmeralda is 53 years old, married, and a resident of Casul, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

Rita has a secondary education and, to provide the primary source of income for her family, is involved in farming and animal husbandry. Started in 1995 with 8,000 som (KGS), thanks to Rita's drive and hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow and 10 sheep. Rita also provides hotel services in a jailoo (yurt) for tourists during the season. In order to further develop her business, Rita requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy sheep.

When she started receiving her pension, she expanded her house to include a bedroom, a living room, and a larger kitchen. However, she soon found that she miscalculated the expenses and did not have the right technical knowledge to do it alone and applied for a credit and technical assistance. Given her age and low income, Marcelina is not able to apply for a credit with other institutions. She is asking for this credit to buy materials needed to complete the house by installing windows, door and replace the dirt floor with cement. Marcelina will receive technical assistance and supervision visits by expert architects to make sure the construction work is not only finished, but also built for lasting quality.

When her father, Pedro, couldn\u2019t work as a farmer any more because of his age, Maria Elena employed her mother as an assistant at the salon. \n\nMaria Elena has been running her business for the last 15 years and making around $700USD a month.  However, Maria Elena was recently divorced and her parents welcomed her back to their home to give her and her children a place to live.  Maria Elena is saving to one day have her own place so tries to avoid complaining about the small space and the fact that she shares a tin ceiling bedroom with her kids and a bathroom with the rest of the house.  Juana knows the space is too small, and that it will be years before her daughter can save enough to move to a house of her own. \n\nJuana is thankful to her daughter for giving Pedro and her an income.  In return, Juana has been saving to build a new bedroom, install proper roofs and build a bathroom for the new family members in the house.  She is now asking for a loan to complete the payment of materials needed.  Because of her age, Juana is not able to get a loan from other banks or organizations.

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nDelia is taking out PHP 10,000 loan assistance to buy supplies and other materials needed in her business. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and other stuffs, which are necessary to increase her inventory. In the future, she dreams of being successful in life and business.

She grew up working with her family all of the time in their business which started out servicing billiard tables and later added a nightclub and drink sales.  When she grew up, she decided on her own to take advantage of this knowledge and make money, and so she started her own business.\r\n\u3000\u3000\r\n\r\nHer shop sells hamburgers, hot dogs, and salchipapas (fried potatoes with hot dog) which she distributes directly to her clientele by credit and cash payment, 7 in the morning to 10 at night, 7 days a week.  Her sales are boosted by her persistence, and among the residents of the neighborhood where her business is located, Liceth has very clear goals such as to expand and purchase her own property later on, and for her infrastructure to be valued highly.  She dreams of finishing her psychology degree at the University.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge for Liceth is that the resources available to her are not sufficient for her to grow rapidly.  She is applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan that she has applied for through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy a cart to sell hot dogs, hamburgers, and soups.  With this, she plans to increase her sales and save on the lease that she currently has, invest in her business, and be successful.

Her husband is retired. Due to life's difficulties and the low amount of her husband's retirement pension, Celina found herself having to start a business. She travels to the north of the country and buys doors for re-selling back in Maputo, in some urban areas that are currently expanding. That way she helps her husband with their household expenses. Nowadays she has a well-developed business and never fails to get customers. With the amount of the loan she'll purchase cement and coarse sand in order to do finishing work on her house. Her biggest dream is to become Hluvuku's best client and get other loans so that she can start a business raising broiler chickens. That way she will ensure her children's education.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,500 every day.\r\n\r\nCuriously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippine.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours.
