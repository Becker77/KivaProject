This will be their tenth group loan.  The previous loans were all fully and correctly repaid.\r\n\r\nChata O (sitting second from the right in the photo) grows peanuts.  She plans to use her loan to buy two 50kg sacks of fertilizer, one drum of herbicide and to pay labour costs to work three-quarters of a hectare of land.  She sells her produce in the village, in Sikasso, to both men and women, for cash or on credit.  Chata O expects to make an average profit of 85,000 francs CFA over the loan period, which she will use to repay her loan and help her husband to provide for their day-to-day expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1628299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, herbicide and pay labour costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kafana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-24T07:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-24T07:10:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":154.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marietou G ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi Seydou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diata Bourama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batitio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnible Z ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba Issa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saran Arouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou Nouhou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata O ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou Ous ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":535000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":535000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":970.17,"local_amount":535000,"processed_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":544045.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":154.83,"payment_id":636515317}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T16:03:29Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Ryder","image":1886035}},{"id":727286,"name":"Yin's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yin is a resident from Kampong Cham province.

Most of them live in traditional families in the commune of Kafana, in the Sikasso district (third administrative region of Mali).\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, the women work with the field partner, Soro Yiriwaso, in order to improve their agricultural businesses.  This will be their sixth group loan.  The previous loans were all fully and correctly repaid.\r\n\r\nDjeneba (standing second from the left in the photo) grows peanuts.  She plans to use her loan to buy one 50kg sack of fertilizer, one drum of herbicide, and pay labour costs to work half a hectare of land.  She sells her produce in the village, in Sikasso, to both men and women, for cash or on credit.  Djeneba expects to make an average profit of 45,000 francs CFA over the loan period, which she will use to repay her loan and help her husband provide for their day-to-day expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1628222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizer, herbicide and pay labour costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kafana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-06-24T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-24T07:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":72.26,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam Diadje","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Socoura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata Ngoro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koniba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":245000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":245000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":452.74,"local_amount":245000,"processed_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253887.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":72.26,"payment_id":636515313}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T16:38:35Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Ryder","image":1886035}},{"id":727297,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is 40 years old, widowed and solely responsible for sending her children to school.

At first, he partenered up with a friend, but he has been working alone for four years now, where before he was simply a helper. Three months ago, he sold all the cows he had, all his investment, in order to have ready cash for his wedding and to build a small house. He works as a farmer and a bricklayer. He needs to cover great distances to go to buy cattle. His hours vary, but he usually works from 7 am to 6 pm.

He is grateful for the opportunity this loan represents. His dream is to have a small animal farm of his own and to make a better life for the children he will soon have.

This is an experience that he does not want his children to have.\r\n\r\nNelson dreams of continuing to prosper and of growing together with his business.  He wants to do this in order to someday build a house from concrete in order to provide his family with greater security.  Nevertheless, for the moment he needs to continue investing in his business.\r\n\r\nIn order to do so, he needs a loan to buy basic grains like rice and beans, among other products to sell at his grocery store.

She has been growing tea and food crops for 13 years. She also raises dairy cattle and poultry. This mother of 4 and the rest of her group members were inspired by the progress other farmers made by forming groups and joining Juhudi Kilimo. \nJudith is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a water tank. A water tank will enable her to collect rainwater for watering her plants and other domestic uses such as washing of clothes. The tank will also save her a lot of time and energy that she would otherwise spend going the spring. \nJudith plans to spend any increase in income that will arise from the water tank satisfying her family's needs and paying her children\u2019s school fees. The tank will also store water in anticipation of drought, thus ensuring the animals and plants to have a constant supply of water.

He is not yet married. Suhrobjon lives with his parents in the countryside. He does not have a higher education because the family's financial situation made it impossible for him to study at the University. Thus, from a young age, he helped his father earn money for the family. His father worked in the field, and Suhrobjon helped him graze cattle. Thus, he learned the trade from his father and now he can run the business himself.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, he works in animal husbandry, in fattening and selling cattle. He makes a good income from this. Suhrobjon wants to increase the number of cattle he has in order to expand his business. He has, therefore, appealed to Arvand to get a loan to purchase of cattle. Suhrobjon is hoping for a positive result, and thanks Arvand in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":880.95,"image":{"id":1625530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

Coron is known for its beautiful beaches and it is a famous tourist spot in the Philippines. However, last November 2013, typhoon Haiyan hit and the place and many businesses were damaged.  Vilma is married to Blandino and they have children. Her business is recovering and is continuously growing. She continues to work to provide for her family.\r\n\r\nVilma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages, piecemeal, to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Vilma is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nVilma hopes that her business will get bigger and she dreams to have a longer life, to spend more time with her grandchildren. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1630045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Juhudi Kilimo partnered with Kiva to provide financial and technical support to farmers such as Wilson, a father of five, in Ndaragwa.\r\n\r\nWilson has been a mixed farmer for 10 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, and food crops. Ndaragwa has a cool climate with a long dry spell each season. The drought accounts for the majority of crop failures experienced in this region leading to starvation.\r\n\r\nWilson is seeking a loan to purchase a high quality dairy cow. Easy availability of feed and fodder all year round makes dairy farming an ideal choice of investment in this region. He is very passionate about dairy farming. When crops failed in the past, he relied upon milk production to keep his family afloat. Dairy farming is not dependent upon rainfall. Dairy farming is always possible even when there is no rainfall whereas agriculture is exclusively dependent on rainfall. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Wilson will benefit in more ways than increased milk production.

This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her family since she is single and has a son.\r\n \r\nWhen she is asked why she likes Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the medical benefits provided her by the institution.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6200,"image":{"id":1627656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-06-24T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-24T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":6200,"lender_count":128,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora Elza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damian Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva Helia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marianela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ceferina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":42672,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":6200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5570.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5801.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5922.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6083.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6250.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6419.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6623.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":809.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":842.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":860.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":883.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":908.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":932.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":962.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1652.37,"local_amount":11372.57,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11417.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546925},{"amount":860.53,"local_amount":5922.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5945.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030089},{"amount":883.97,"local_amount":6083.96,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6107.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522307},{"amount":908.13,"local_amount":6250.28,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6274.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655947},{"amount":932.7,"local_amount":6419.4,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6444.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579574934},{"amount":962.3,"local_amount":6623.11,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6649.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168795}],"funded_date":"2014-07-11T03:10:30Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:02:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz A Santillan","image":null}},{"id":726372,"name":"Renacer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cRENACER\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el d\u00e9cimo s\u00e9ptimo ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Panamericana, est\u00e1 compuesta por diez  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Marina es la Presidenta.

Dairy farming is not directly dependent on rainfall, unlike crop farming, which can be fatally affected by drought.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
