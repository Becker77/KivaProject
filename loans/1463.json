All her life she has worked making and selling charcoal in Borbon and San Lorenzo.  Her children go to school and she would like to change her occupation, because what she is doing is very dangerous and she is constantly burning her skin and hands.  She does not want her children to learn this trade because it is dangerous.  Because her children are in school, it is imperative that she support them.  For this reason she now works raising chickens.  With this loan through FODEMI, she will be able to buy 100 chickens, balanced food for them and also some products to sell in a small store in her community.  She says she has problems with charcoal because often people do not pay her the full price, and it is expensive to transport it to San Lorenzo and Borbon.  Many times she doesn't sell it and has to go home, having wasted money on transportation.  She says that making charcoal is a difficult and badly paid local activity.  With her change in occupation, she is sure that she will be able to provide better income and opportunities for her children.  In the future she would like to buy a house in a place where they will have access to secondary

The group is comprised of eight members and presided by Juana as head of its bureau. All members raise milk cows. The loan will thus benefit small entrepreneurs. Juana says it is her first time working with Pro Mujer, an institution she learned of thanks to a massive promotional campaign it launched. Juana sells the milk her cows produce and wants to bolster her business with this first loan, which she will put to good use since she knows how to sell her product.

To Vincent, storing water in water tanks not only reduces their work for fetching, but also puts an end to the wastage that takes place when rain water simply drains away.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1630399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-25T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-25T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6286.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7411.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7610.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7884.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8028.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8299.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8468.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8696.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9028},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9173.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9437.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9675.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175.86,"local_amount":15292.48,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":15396.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570930},{"amount":91.3,"local_amount":7938.8,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7992.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054299},{"amount":88.91,"local_amount":7731.68,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7784.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547479},{"amount":95.68,"local_amount":8320.11,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8376.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680448},{"amount":93.76,"local_amount":8153.21,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8208.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624738},{"amount":201.98,"local_amount":17563.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17683.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823317},{"amount":402.51,"local_amount":35000.39,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":35239.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636263919}],"funded_date":"2014-07-09T00:31:51Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:03:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":727632,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is a smallholder farmer in Chuka, Kenya.

","en":"Mijgona is a businesswoman who lives in Dushanbe, the capital city. At 27 she is married and has a son, a daughter, and her own retail business. In 2009 she began to sell clothing and has been running her business from home for five years. She sells women's and children's clothing. Her customers are her neighbors, relatives, acquaintances, friends, and so forth. Her clothing quickly sells out because she knows a lot about clothes and only buys high-quality, comfortable items. Now she needs a loan to purchase new seasonal clothing for women and children. This loan is important to her so that she can keep up her business.

She is 48 years old and has eight children. Melitin, her husband, works as a driver. She manages a food-vending business and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nNancy is requesting a loan to purchase more quantities of products, like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Nancy hopes her small 'carinderia' (a local eatery, selling and serving affordable viands for the masses in the Philippines) will become a big restaurant. She wants her children to finish their studies and also prays that she will always be healthy and strong for them.\r\n\r\nEvery week, Nancy meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

","en":"Luis is 62 years old. He lives in the city of Barranquilla and he works making and selling artisanal women\u2019s shoes. He is been doing this for over 30 years.\r\n\r\n Before doing this, he was making an income working in any occupation that would allow him to make some money to survive. He states \u201c I looked for work, I did whatever they wanted me to do.\" That\u2019s how one day he found a small footwear company to work in. He learned there everything he knows today, until he became independent. He owns a business today, he makes sandals, female shoes, and school shoes, and he sales them on credit.\r\nHis biggest clients are the corner shops, where he distributes the footwear and they keep some models to sell on the shelves. He purchases the raw materials and supplies  in leather shops or warehouses specialized in shoes and similar products. He buys in bulk and that gives him really competitive prices.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he is requesting a loan to buy synthetics and supplies to make new and modern designs. His goal is to expand his business and support his grandson with his professional studies. His big challenge will be to have enough work to be able to do it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1628503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Her husband and the youngest son actively help her with the farming. Ainura has vocational education. As a main source of income for her family, she has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation for a period of 20 years. She started a business 8 years ago with a sum of 4,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Ainura's persistent work, her farm currently has two dairy cows, two bulls, one calf, five sheep, five goats and one horse. She also has a plot of land of 1.38 hectares, where she grows potatoes and sainfoin. She also has a garden which brings a good seasonal profit. Ainura's monthly income from the business is around 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Ainura turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of 1 bull-calf and high quality potato seeds. Ainura plans to invest the income from the loan in developing the business, which will allow her to give her youngest son a decent education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1631179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a bull-calf and high quality potato seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zheti-Oguz village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-06-25T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-25T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":53.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":453.9,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":25404.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.6,"payment_id":624799013},{"amount":467.85,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25404.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.65,"payment_id":664995347}],"funded_date":"2014-06-26T21:15:27Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":727933,"name":"Chea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chea, 49, is married with four children residing in a rural village located in the Siem Reap province\u2019s Srey Snom district, Cambodia.

Nargiza has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she works with field crop cultivation, after having started this business in 2009. \r\n\r\nThanks to Nargiza's perseverance, purposefulness and hard work, she currently has 4.0 hectares of irrigated land, where she grows peppers, beans and clover.

He is requesting a loan for a maize mill to provide a maize milling service to over 200 families in his community.\n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most rural families in Kapiri Mposhi District grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima. While only 29 years old, Lemison is already a well-respected member in his community and wants to expand his business to offer the maize milling service. \n\nRent-to-Own has done market research in Lemison\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest maize mill is over 13 km away, but is often broken down. This means most potential customers have to travel to other villages, and since most will walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. \n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many enterprising farmers and rural business owners such as Lemison, as it allows for him to diversify his business. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill are very prohibitive. Once he secures a loan, Lemison will be able to get a maize mill from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nThis loan will help Lemison on the path to building up a viable business that can provide for his family and community throughout the year.

As a mother of three living in the Gokwe South District of Zimbabwe, Brenda works hard at her poultry business to support her family. She has been successfully running a poultry project for over 18 months, selling chicken to the local community with the help of her family. She started the business with batches of 25 broiler birds every 6 weeks, and she has since increased her capacity to 100. Brenda also volunteers as a Camfed Learner Guide, teaching students life skills at the local secondary school.

His spouse is a homemaker.   \nIt is clear that Felipe works hard to maintain his\/her family and at night, after a hard day of work, the conditions in the house are not very good due to the lack of electricity.   The family currently illuminates their home with kerosene lamps the electrical utility grid does not reach this rural area.  The kerosene lamps, which must be lit by striking a match, produce substantial contamination in the house, present a risk of fire and produce a very low level of lighting. \nHe mentioned that he hopes to be able to charge his cell phone which is important for communication and he is concerned about the kerosene fumes.   To improve living conditions for his family, Felipe is requesting a loan to purchase a complete solar electric system from Soluz Honduras.  With this system the illumination in the house will be with highly efficient and long life LED lamps.  With electrical light it is much easier to study and other activities are much more pleasant, such as cooking in the kitchen or gathering the family at the dinner table or in the living room. The solar electric system can power a television and radio which provide entertainment, news and education in this rural area providing better access to information from within the country and around the world. The system can also maintain the charge in a cellular telephone to allow essential communications from this rural area.\nIn addition to the reduction of toxic fumes from kerosene lamps, the solar electric system reduces the family\u2019s energy costs by eliminating the cost of kerosene, the cost of dry cell batteries for radios and the cost of cell phone charging with related cost of transport to an urban center for charging.  These savings will provide Felipe a return on his investment in the solar electric system.  The solar panel has a 25 year warranty. Soluz Honduras installs, guarantees, and maintains the system to assure that the benefits will continue for many years. \nA positive global environmental impact of this investment is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (0.25 tons per year) that results from the elimination of kerosene consumption. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1630776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a solar energy system for his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":390,"posted_date":"2014-06-25T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-25T22:40:06Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":22220,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2076.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2107.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2138.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2170.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2203.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2236.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2270.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2304.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2338.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.53,"local_amount":2076.11,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2096.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.26,"payment_id":517676349},{"amount":110.66,"local_amount":2107.25,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:26:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2128.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.77,"payment_id":530183475},{"amount":576.16,"local_amount":11019.98,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11130.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.58,"payment_id":542658325},{"amount":119.61,"local_amount":2304.16,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2327.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.23,"payment_id":624392600},{"amount":141.58,"local_amount":2790.85,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2818.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6,"payment_id":636462385},{"amount":97.24,"local_amount":1921.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1940.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.38,"payment_id":649731485}],"funded_date":"2014-06-28T07:55:51Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T15:37:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":729772,"name":"Voeng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Voeng\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kompong Thom province in Cambodia.

She could not continue with her studies due to scant economic resources. She is married and her husband works in agriculture. She has four children who are studying and who are the only ones who are dependent on her.\r\n\r\nJuana is a domestic worker. She has been doing this for 18 years. Since she finished her studies she went out to work with her father in agriculture, and she is now planting her own maize field with her husband. Juana also looks after domestic animals, which she does in her house. As for the agricultural work, she has to walk for 25 minutes to get to the maize field.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan in order to purchase fertilisers for her maize field. She will buy five sacks of fertiliser and two bags of seed, and she will pay labourers. The money will be distributed in this way because she wants to manage her parcel of maize well.\r\n\r\nHer dream for the future is to have a good yield from her harvest and thereby obtain better output, which will enable her to provide food for her family and, if possible, sell these staple grains.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1629423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilisers for her maize field.
