She learned the business from her mother who was in the same line of work and encouraged her to travel to a border town in order to buy merchandise that she could sell in her neighborhood.  Liliana purchased her goods on credit and collected payments from her customers weekly, biweekly, or monthly for the items they had ordered so that she could pay the bills.  Today she continues in the same manner, selling on credit or for cash.  <br \/><br \/>In order to expand her business, Liliana needed a wider variety of products.  In addition, her mother was selling beer and soft drinks before she became ill.  Liliana took over that business so that she could increase earnings.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy soft drinks, beer, and a freezer.  This will give her additional income, which will be of great help with the household expenses.  Her family consists of her husband and her four-year-old son.  <br \/><br \/>Liliana opens her business at 3:00 P.M. and continues on until 11:00 P.M.  She sells on credit and for cash.  Liliana is putting forth great effort in order to accomplish her goal of improving the condition of her business.  Owning a home in the future will be a great challenge for her since she needs to have sufficient funds to reach that goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1628444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/

She has a small sewing shop where she makes uniforms, blouses, skirts, dresses, and anything else people ask her to. She learned this trade in 1984. It was her mother's tradition, as her mother spent her whole life sewing for relatives, neighbors and friends. Nury works every day from 7 in the morning until 8 at night. She does all of the work of preparing the assembly and finishing of the pieces to finally sell the finished product to her customers, thus satisfying their demand.

Previously, he worked as a a driver, but his financial situation was declining little by little and that made his have to sell off his work vehicles, but right away his present business grew. That is how he decided to do this activity full time so he could improve his family's financial situation. The distance he travels varies because he distributes in two towns nearby to where he lives and he gets around in a motorcycle. The schedule is also variable because he is on call to deliver gas to his customers. \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy 50 cylinders of gas. The ones he has now aren't enough because he has too many customers and sometimes he runs out of product and stops earning profits.  \r\n\r\nJacob's dream is to improve his business by buying more cylinders and then a car to transport his product. For his family, he intends to help his children so that they will have the opportunity to go to college which will guarantee them dignified work in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1627415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy 50 cylinders of gas.

It is comprised of nine members and headed by Maria as president. Members carry out various types of activities: mobile phone sales, clothing sales, clothes shop, carpentry, food sales, cloth weaving, fast food shop, bell pepper sales, condiments sales. This loan will thus benefit small entrepreneurs. Maria says this is her first time working with Pro Mujer, and that she heard of this institution thanks to a massive campaign it organised. She operates a small mobile phone business and has been doing so for several years. She learned the trade from her husband, who also sold phones. She needs to increase her working capital to buy mobile phones wholesale from sellers in the city of El Alto. She will then sell them at her shop. This business generates income for her to support her family, since she is single and has a child. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she mentions training received in the area of health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1627667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy mobile phones wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-06-26T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-26T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helen\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crispin\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23648,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3613},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3780.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3884.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3989.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4097.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4282.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":523.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":547.55},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":577.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":593.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":620.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1070.83,"local_amount":7393.56,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T12:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":7399.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517546927},{"amount":562.55,"local_amount":3884.16,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3887.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030091},{"amount":577.84,"local_amount":3989.72,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3992.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522309},{"amount":593.5,"local_amount":4097.8,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4100.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655949},{"amount":620.28,"local_amount":4282.76,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4285.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579574936}],"funded_date":"2014-07-11T14:51:18Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:26:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":728142,"name":"Rouayat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rouayat is a 53-year-old divorced mother of two.

26-year-old married mother of one son who is still too small for school. Rice farming and cassava growing have been the main source of her family\u2019s income for 10 years. To better support the family and help to earn more income, her husband also works as a paid worker. Together, they can earn enough to use 46,000 KHR per day to meet the family\u2019s needs and save about 50,000 KHR each day for future needs. \r\n\r\nSophea is a member of a two-person group that has been with VisionFund for one cycle and completely repaid the previous loan. The first loan helped Sophea better support her family members. Now she is applying for a loan to buy pesticides and fertilizers for her farmland. With this loan, she hopes to grow her rice fruitfully and healthily, and also hopes to make more income to improve her standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1631109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

His home is very near the fabled Plain of Jars.  Despite living in some of the most beautiful mountains and surrounded by lush vegetation Yerr's community and the surrounding province face a daily challenge in finding clean water to drink.  Most villagers are forced to head to a nearby stream or haul contaminated water from a shallow well to their homes.  If they boil to treat contaminated water it requires a significant amount of time and fuel.  By selling water filters, Yerr helps his community overcome the problem of contaminated drinking water.  Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter!  Yerr is a change agent and is doing his part; he often travels up to 100km per day to sell approximately 20 water filters per month.  One water filter in a home provides clean drinking water to an average of 5.8 people; consequently, Mr Yerr can provide clean water to over 100 people each month.

Meet Erick, a farmer in Molo, Kenya. Erick has a wife and two children. For the past four years, Erick\u2019s primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nHe is most passionate about dairy farming: income from milk is significant and comes regularly. His biggest challenge has been transporting milk to the market, due to poor transport and a poor road network. He decided to purchase a motorcycle for easy market accessibility and mobility. As farmers kept approaching Erick to provide transportation services, this grew into a business that solved a challenge many farmers were facing. The motorcycle made work much easier, cheaper and convenient for farmers. \r\n\r\nErick is seeking a loan to purchase another motorcycle. He will use the money generated from this asset to repay the loan and improve his family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n \r\nYour loan will empower farmers, as well as have a positive impact on their

She has four children. She is in the business of hand embroidery. She makes beautiful patterns for the people of her community. Her designs are much in demand and she has managed to develop a clientele that allows her to contribute to the expenses of her home.

Jeremiah had been engaged in farming--keeping poultry and dairy cows--for less than three years, when he saw a big gap and seized the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe road networks in Nyamira have been terrible since time immemorial. The road situation has forced farmers to sell their produce within their environs at a low price because of surplus supply. Roads to the farm can hardly be accessed by motor vehicles. \r\n\r\nJeremiah purchased an ideal Indian motorcycle with low fuel consumption, low maintenance costs and a great deal of flexibility. With this machine, he was able to transport his milk and eggs to a distant market with fair prices, as well as offer transportation services to pedestrians along the way when he was returning. \r\n\r\nHe saw a bigger potential in helping other farmers transport their produce and sell it at a better market price. Jeremiah is seeking a loan to purchase more motorcycles. This will enable him to fill the demand for his services as well as offer employment to others in his community. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Jeremiah will realize his vision of offering transformational

With traditional cook stoves, there is a lot of Indoor Air Pollution (IAP)which leads to respiratory diseases and also there is a lot of charcoal consumption by the traditional stoves.\n\nCurrently on average each member spends USD1.3 on charcoal everyday. The loan will enable them purchase high efficient cook stoves- ECO ZOOM that will save them up to 50% of their daily consumption on charcoal. These cook stoves also reduce smoke and carbon emissions from the charcoal thus creating a better and cleaner environment for their families.\n\nThe families will be able to save USD 0.65 daily from the reduced consumption on charcoal.  This translates to USD234 every year for at least 5 years (lifetime of the cook stove).

She would like to buy more cows, but raising money to do so is a big challenge for her.\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is a microfinance field partner that works with partners such as Kiva to afford marginal farmers access financial to services that they can otherwise not get because of the loan requirements. Mary is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase a dairy cow. The cow is expected to produce 15 litres of milk or more daily. The income she projects from this venture will enable her to fully repay the loan and save extra money. Her family\u2019s diet will also improve as a result of the increased milk production.\r\n\r\nThe increased income will relieve the burden of high farm-related expenses from her shoulders. And her family will have enough food as a benefit from your lending.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1631340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"o purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-26T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-26T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4291.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5059.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5382.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5480.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5665.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5781.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5964.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6141.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6263.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6443.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6605.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.69,"local_amount":5435.32,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5569.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570937},{"amount":57.28,"local_amount":4888.64,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5009.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054306},{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":5389.87,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547487},{"amount":62.02,"local_amount":5292.63,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5423.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680457},{"amount":61.99,"local_amount":5290.86,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5421.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624747},{"amount":70.7,"local_amount":6033.91,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6182.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193818},{"amount":421.17,"local_amount":35943.77,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36830.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823321}],"funded_date":"2014-06-27T11:57:29Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":728335,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a single woman.

Meet Rebecca, age 34. This mother of 1 is a resident of Kapsowar village in the North Rift region of Kenya. She is a smallholder farmer who has been engaged in mixed farming for 15 years!  She keeps dairy cows and poultry and grows tea and other greens. She also engages in other personal businesses to make extra income.\r\n \r\nRebecca is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow. The additional cow will increase milk production and sales volume. Quality grade cows produce up to 20 litres daily in this region. Income generated from selling that volume of milk is enough to always repay the loan\u2019s installments on time. \r\n\r\nThe dairy industry in Kenya has a recognized potential to generate higher income and transform living standards if appropriate interventions are developed and implemented. It also contributes significantly to food security and employment.\r\n\r\nFor Rebecca to become competitive and attain the vast potential, she requires training to handle emerging issues. Juhudi has an extension officer at Rebecca\u2019s disposal for all the technical guidance and training programs. This will ensure she employs the best practices in dairy farming to guarantee success. She plans to spend the proceeds back into the dairy business. With your help, her family will enjoy financial security from this venture.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1631369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-26T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-26T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4291.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5059.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5382.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5480.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5665.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5781.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5964.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6141.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6263.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6443.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6605.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.69,"local_amount":5435.32,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5569.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570938},{"amount":57.28,"local_amount":4888.64,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5009.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054307},{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":5389.87,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547488},{"amount":64.69,"local_amount":5521.02,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5657.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680458},{"amount":62.91,"local_amount":5369.21,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5501.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624748},{"amount":73.66,"local_amount":6286.01,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6441.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193819},{"amount":67.07,"local_amount":5723.72,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5864.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823322},{"amount":347.55,"local_amount":29661.21,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":30393.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261777}],"funded_date":"2014-06-27T06:42:00Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":727609,"name":"Salvador Emilio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Candados colocados por orden de tama\u00f1o, controles de televisores de diferentes marcas se cubren bajo envolturas de colores rosados y verdes, bombillos de distintos estilos, entre otros productos, arreglan la ferreter\u00eda de Salvador, un comerciante de 61 a\u00f1os, quien se ha mantenido a la vanguardia en los productos del hogar gracias a un pr\u00e9stamo anterior de MiCr\u00e9dito-KIVA, donde compr\u00f3 anteojos, hebillas, desarmadores, correas, etc\u00e9tera para mejorar su negocio. \nPadre de 3 hijos, de los cuales est\u00e1 a cargo junto a su pareja y quienes lo apoyan siempre en el negocio familiar.

He owns a small plot of land on which he has been practising mixed farming for more than 14 years! He grows a variety of crops and keeps dairy cows and poultry. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family expenses. In order to take better care of his family of six children, financially speaking, William needs to significantly increase the quantity of milk he sells from his farm. \r\n\r\nWilliam is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow. William is expecting a 20 litre increase in milk production daily with the new cow.  The income generated as a result is enough to repay the loan within the repayment period on time. The additional income will go towards the education of William\u2019s children.\r\n\r\nIn future, William is going to introduce zero-grazing which he projects will lead to a further increase in milk production. William can\u2019t wait to start making real profits from dairy farming. Currently, his biggest challenge is limited funds. William is thankful for Juhudi Kilimo and its partners like KIVA who are there to support smallholder farmers.\r\n\r\nHe plans to plough some of the extra money he will make back into the business and purchase better quality cows.

Meet Peter. He is a father of five who lives and farms in Kisii, a rural town in Kenya. Peter and his tribesmen are known for taking bananas as their staple food. Peter has been practising mixed farming for 20 years! His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, bananas and personal business. He is very passionate about farming: \u201cIt has been my source of income for all this time!\u201d he exclaimed. \r\n\r\nHis biggest challenge is poor roads leading to the market. Because of this, they settle for local markets that offer lower prices. Peter is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow that produces more than 10 litres of milk a day. This is an upgrade from the traditional breeds that are kept for subsistence.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Peter is going to shift into commercial dairy farming to improve the living standard of his family. Most of the money will go to his children\u2019s education since that sets the foundation for their future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1631442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-06-26T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-26T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1307.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1541.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1583.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1639.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1669.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1726.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1761.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1808.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1877.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1908.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1963.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2012.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.83,"local_amount":3313.92,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3483.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570942},{"amount":19.77,"local_amount":1644.51,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1728.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054311},{"amount":18.92,"local_amount":1574.39,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1654.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547492},{"amount":19.66,"local_amount":1636.04,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1719.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680462},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":1833.62,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1927.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624752},{"amount":21.84,"local_amount":1817.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1910.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193823},{"amount":107.94,"local_amount":8980.25,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9438.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261780}],"funded_date":"2014-06-27T18:21:42Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":728361,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilson is a married Ugandan man with four children; three are in school.

Meet Miriam. The mother of five lives on a small piece of land in Kisii, Kenya. Miriam has been involved in farming for more than 18 years! Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, food crops and other personal businesses.\r\n\r\nOf all the activity she is involved in, she finds maize farming to be the most enjoyable. The biggest challenge she dreads is animal diseases. This negatively affects productivity. \r\n\r\nMiriam is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. The cow is going to produce more than 10 litres of milk a day for sale.
