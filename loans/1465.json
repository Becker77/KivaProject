When she was a child, her parents were not able to provide her with a good education.  Therefore, she dropped out of school.  She is married and has five children, but at the moment, only three of them depend on her financially.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, she works in the production of cigars; a job which she has done since she was little.  She learnt the skills from her mother, who still helps her today.  She has no fixed working hours; she just finishes work when she has taken care of the orders.  Besides this, her husband works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nAna is asking for a loan from CrediCampo to sow corn and to buy tobacco so she can carry on making cigars.  At the moment, she has got a lot of orders but her lack of cash is making it hard for her to supply them.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a better home and helping her mum financially so that she doesn't have to work.  She knows that it is a lot, but with the help of God and the loaners, anything is

He is married with two children. He lives in the north-east area of Haiti, where electricity isn't commonplace and clean drinking water is very limited. Jackson has been in the business of selling various items for the past 13 years. With this loan, he is planning to purchase various items, such as clothes, cosmetic products and shoes. Before starting this business, he worked as a teacher.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will help him grow his business. The other members of the Deborah De Samarie Group need a loan to help them with their businesses in selling foodstuffs, carbonated drinks and charcoal.

From age 9 to 15, Jean could be found secretly using his uncle's sewing machine every time his uncle wasn't home. When discovered, he was punished for using or damaging the sewing machine. By the time he went to high school, his interest continued and he became the one who fixed his friends' pants by hemming, doing zipper installations, and sewing on buttons, patches and badges. It became obvious that he could earn a living in the sewing industry. His uncle finally understood Jean\u2019s passion to be a tailor and for his 18th birthday, he offered him a small sewing machine. As a result of this precious gift, Jean quickly decided to open his business in the community. Jean has been very sensitive to satisfying both his internal and external customers. The business has gained a scope of influence and credibility from customers by knowing and using techniques and by exceeding their expectations for years. However, the business biggest challenge is to keep up with its economic efficiency, which is based on the market change, the selling price, the cost of resources, the sale price, and always providing a quality product with on time delivery to his clientele.

With this loan, Mohammed is well on his way to achieving this dream. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":1627560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To access high-quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed in order to double his income and yield.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-06-27T17:30:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-27T17:30:36Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohammed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":11596,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11596}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.51,"local_amount":11596,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12211.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.49,"payment_id":752023791}],"funded_date":"2014-06-27T19:57:33Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T13:59:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":728574,"name":"Frantzdy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Frantzdy didn\u2019t have enough money to go to college after finishing high school.

When asked, Yohanna Amadu said, \u201cI plan to use the money I make to educate my children: Emma, Yusuf,  and Ayuba, and in five years, I want to become the most profitable farmer in my community\u201d. With this loan, he is well on his way to achieving this dream.

She and her family live in a small, traditional Thai house and mostly earn a living through agricultural activities such as cultivating rice, planting vegetables, and breeding chickens and fish. However, because of a lack of land, it is hard for Thin to expand her farming, so she has opened a grocery store and her husband works extra for a local construction employer. \r\n\r\nIn spite of their constant efforts, their income is only enough to cover their family's basic living expenses and tuition fees for their children.  Thin cannot afford to buy new furniture for her house or books or toys for her children.

Adamu joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children Aminu and Safariya. Adamu is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty.

Without this loan, he would be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive but are often diluted with external products such as sand. With access to high quality inputs, Adamu can reap up to 30 bags\/hectare, double the national average of 14 and earn up to $2,000\/hectare, more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

The loan will be used to buy fertilizers for the plants and more items for the retail shop, which will help Magret to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Magret hopes that in the future she will be able to take a hairdressing course. \n\nMagret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\n\n\n\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1627259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable
