Way back in grade school, Jay made a name for himself among his classmates by painting denim jackets and selling them for $20. Jay enjoyed the recognition his peers gave him for his artistic ability, which led him at the age of 14 to broaden his skills by working for a silk-screener after school. It was here that Jay started building what would become the foundation of his future business, DyseOne.\r\n\r\nJay and his brother grew up without a father figure. Raised by a single mother, they spent their free time pursuing the dream of being street artists, trawling the San Diego streets late at night looking for virgin walls upon which they could present their artistic vision.  Unfortunately the authorities did not look kindly on their use of public space, arresting Jay several times and eventually sending him to Juvenile Detention. \r\n\r\nWith time to think, Jay realized that it was not fun going to jail for painting on walls, and that by using different avenues to present his art, he could better serve both his own interests and the interests of the community. On July 9, 2007, Jay formed DyseOne, a clothing company representing the culmination of a lifetime of skill-honing and preparation.\r\n\r\nFor Jay, serving his local community and maintaining artistic integrity were always more important than profit-seeking. It is for this reason that Jay continues to keep his price points low.\r\n\r\n \u201cI cater to the not so fortunate, the street-wear market,\u201d said Jay. \u201cI keep prices low so the people from the neighborhood I grew up in can afford it.\u201d \r\n\r\nJay will use his Kiva loan to purchase inventory to expand his already profitable and growing business, with an established network of wholesale distributors in Spain and Australia, as well as through orders coming in from Ross Dress for Less and the Burlington Coat Factory.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4054.62,"image":{"id":1632153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a mother to two daughters and a son. She says that all her hard work and efforts are for her children who she loves unconditionally. She is the featured profile member of \u201cSahei\u201d group and is pictured with her hand raised.\r\n  \r\nHer husband is a policeman in the Manipur Police Department. He is the sole breadwinner of the family. Kimbem is a housewife. Although she doesn't engage in a specific profession, she gives her best effort in raising her kids. Her children are still young and they need her special attention, says Kimbem. She takes care of their daily schedule and household chores. Like every mother, she wishes for her kids to have decent careers and become successful in the future.\r\n\r\nKimbem wanted a loan for a solar home lighting system for her children to have a better study environment as well as for household use.  As the power supply is irregular and unreliable in the village, a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system that will light four bulbs for 12 hours a day, can help her kids to study for longer hours.

She says that it has been three years since she joined Pro Mujer, via an invitation from a colleague who is a client of the institution. Currently, she has a pharmacy business; she reveals that she bought the business three years ago with the first loan secured by Pro Mujer, since she had previously studied in this area and had previously worked in an identical business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she currently requests is for increasing capital (purchasing medicines in bulk), which she will acquire from the pharmacy wholesalers in the city of La Paz and subsequently will sell them in her retail space.

It is made up of nine members and is directed by a board of directors where se\u00f1ora Hermenegilda is President. The members of the communal bank have various businesses, among which there are: mobile phone sales, clothing sales, a clothing shop, a carpentry workshop, food sales, blanket-weaving, kebab sales, pepper sales, and condiment sales.\r\n\r\nThe loan which they will receive will benefit small micro businesses where se\u00f1ora Hermenegilda is a member. She says that she became a member of Pro Mujer one year ago, after the invitation of one of the organisation's promoters who came to visit her at her home. She currently has a business selling pulses. She explains that she started this business several years ago to support her parents, who did the same work. \r\n \r\nThe loan which she will receive now is to increase capital (buying seeds wholesale), which she will acquire from the wholesale sellers in La Paz and later grow in her allotment. This way of working allows her to generate income to support her family, as she is married and has two children.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the health service that the organisation offers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":1631688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-06-28T11:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-28T11:00:01Z","loan_amount":3725,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermenegilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Lely\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosaura\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Betzabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Elisa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eloy Genaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25648,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3469.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4088.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4198.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4313.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4430.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5146.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":503.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":593.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":626.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":747.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1097.74,"local_amount":7558.33,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7584.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030117},{"amount":609.83,"local_amount":4198.92,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4213.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522335},{"amount":626.47,"local_amount":4313.44,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4328.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655975},{"amount":643.46,"local_amount":4430.48,"processed_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4446.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579574962},{"amount":747.5,"local_amount":5146.83,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5164.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168813}],"funded_date":"2014-07-11T10:33:00Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Hoare","image":null}},{"id":728479,"name":"Lidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lidia es una mujer de 46 a\u00f1os de edad es soltera y no tiene hijos, toda su vida la pas\u00f3 junto a su madre ayud\u00e1ndole en todo y cuid\u00e1ndola, cuando era ni\u00f1a le preparaba el desayuno a  mam\u00e1 y mam\u00e1 le preparaba el almuerzo, \u00a8siempre sent\u00ed que era yo quien la cuidaba\u00a8 ella y su madre son un equipo s\u00f3lo se tiene la una  a la otra y comparten todo.\nLidia se dedica al comercio de electrodom\u00e9sticos no tiene un lugar de venta fijo por lo que es una vendedora ambulante, sue\u00f1a con tener una tienda fija para trabajar y as\u00ed sacar a su madre adelante.\nLidia no pudo estudiar la vida le ense\u00f1o todo lo que sabe, a pesar de todas las dificultades por las que pasa ella es feliz junto a su ser m\u00e1s preciado su madre.

He is a farmer who didn't have the opportunity to have an education. When he was a boy, he lived in an very rural area and there wasn't any type of service offered by the government like health, education, or others. Now he lives with his father who is a little sick, and he has to take the reins of the household.  \r\n\r\nHe has worked practically his whole life in farming. When he was young, he planted corn and beans but he worked a lot and didn't make the expected profits. Now he has been growing jicama for 5 years. This crop requires fewer expenses and less work.

Rolando finished his secondary education and entered a pastry course.  Little by little, he began to specialize and take other courses. He got a loan granted by his parents with which he purchased an oven. He married and, with his wife, opened a business - a pastry shop. \"At first there weren't many customers and we had to go to the secondary schools and universities and leave our pastries and cakes in the food stalls and cafeterias.\"\r\n\r\nAs his pastry shop became more known, his family grew.

She hopes to eventually expand into a large retail business in order to better provide for her child.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1632785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Gokwe South","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2014-06-28T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-28T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T10:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529995358},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542487182},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-22T10:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562931568},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581585759},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-23T11:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595129405}],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T21:51:30Z","paid_date":"2015-01-23T11:12:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":729199,"name":"Zahid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahid, a 49-year-old married man, is an IDP (internally displaced person) who lives with his family in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement.

","en":"Nargis is a conscientious woman who was born in 1988. She is married and has three young children. She started her own business preparing and selling a variety of cold dishes two years ago.

They all live in a small village on the outskirts of Saikul in Manipur state, which is in the northeastern part of India. They came together as a group to take a loan in order to create income activities for themselves. Rabeka is the group leader, pictured with her hand raised. She is 43 years old and the mother of three daughters and one son. Her husband is a pensioner. He gets just a meager amount. Therefore, in order to supplement the family income, Rabeka usually weaves traditional garments like wrap-around skirts, shawls and vest coats. She initiated and formed the group to fulfill the capital needs for her income activities. With her first loan in 2010, a sum of 5,000 INR she bought two piglets and with the little amount left she purchased all the requirements for weaving (loom, thread, needs). She started weaving four days a week and was able to produce six traditional wrap-arounds of different quality and four shawls in a month and a week\u2019s time. Her husband helped her with the loan repayments for the initial months. With the profits, she was able to repay the loan and buy utensils for family use and yarn to continue weaving. With her second loan in 2011, she took 10,000 INR for weaving. She was able to produce more by channeling her sales and supplying a retailer as well as selling some herself. With her income, she managed to support her children's education better. She was able to pay the children's school fees on time and manage the household expenses. In 2012, Rabeka took her third loan of 10,000 INR to expand her weaving business. She wanted to save some from the income she earned for her children for the future. However, due to increments of educational expenses every year she couldn't do so. She wanted her eldest daughter to pursue a nursing career and her son to become an army officer.    \r\n\r\nShe is happy that her children could continue their education without having to stop due to financial obligations. Now Rabeka needs another loan to continue with her weaving business. She will use the loan to stock yarn of different colors and textures to weave the traditional wrap-around skirts, shawls and vest coats that she has been weaving. She also means to use part of the loan for the children's enrollment fees for the next session. The rest of the group members also need another loan to upgrade and do better at their respective activities. The group members' activities can be classified as weaving, piggery, variety store, ginger and yam cultivation.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1632798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy yarn with different patterns and colors to weave ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-06-28T18:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-28T18:30:10Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengkhokim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabeka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jangnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamjahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingpineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-06-30T18:12:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":729243,"name":"Ramzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"At the age of 46, Ramzana is a hard-working, married woman.

Her husband is a farmer by profession and grows rice from an inherited paddy field. During the off season, her husband earns money on a daily wage. In order to supplement the family income, she sells rice house to house and sometimes sells in the market place. With her first loan, she bought rice grains, which she took to the mill to separate the husk from the grain. She would also sell from her granary to earn more profits. This is how the family's main source of income is generated. With her earnings, she managed her children's schooling requirements apart from the family maintenance. She needs another loan to continue her business activities. She also wishes to multiply her income activities for her future plan. With the loan, she wants to buy more stock to expand her business and sell for profit. Likewise, the rest of the group members need another loan to improve their respective income activities. Among the group members, some of them too are in the rice business and others in the weaving sector.

The nine women in the Trust Bank work in various small businesses, including the production and sale of handicrafts and traditional textiles, as well as a tortilla storefront where tortillas are freshly made and sold three times each day. Another lady has a convenience store where items for everyday consumption are sold. \r\n\r\nPetrona, who is married with four children, is a motivated member of the Trust Bank. As the family is quite large and her husband\u2019s earnings are not enough, Petrona has a clothing store. She is also a nurse. Petrona is starting her first loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and is requesting a loan which she will use to buy clothing to resell, including pants, shirts and tee shirts. She also sells traditional clothing. Petrona is most aware that this is a perfect time to sell to the influx of visitors that come to San Pedro at this time of the year because it is the \u201cFair of the Villages\u201d, and sales will increase. She wants to realize increased income by having enough inventory.\r\n\r\nThe women in the Trust Bank are very aware of the value of education and its impact on themselves and their children. Petrona has a daughter who is about to graduate from high school this year. The women have had little or no education. They are most pleased not only to receive financial capital in the form of the small loans but also to participate in the non-formal educational component of their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer joins the ladies and shares information about business and money management, marketing, pricing and customer service. They also learn about women\u2019s health, self esteem and domestic violence. The combination of the loans and education is called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it is unique to Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nAll of the ladies in the Trust Bank look forward to empowering themselves and eliminating poverty in their lives. The support of KIVA investors and Friendship Bridge is so very valuable and the women are most appreciative. Thank you to each KIVA investor!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":1630707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothing to resell, including pants, shirts and tee shirts.

The Friendship Bridge Trust bank, \u201cMariana\u201d, has been formed here and is composed of eight dynamic close friends who have been together for several years. They have recently welcomed a new member to the group.\r\n\r\nJuana is a 45-year-old President of the Trust Bank who is married with one child. For several years, Juana has been involved in the production of traditional colorful textiles which she fabricates by hand. Because of her beautifully crafted and elaborate designs, her work is in high demand, even though it is a bit more costly to her customers. As her business is enjoying increased success, she has hired three of her sisters. Juana is applying for a new loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase a wide variety of thread, yarn and other supplies. She shares, \"I am so grateful to Friendship Bridge and to all the people who support the organization, because they are supporting so many women. The results of our hard work may not be immediately visible, but we are working very hard to maintain and improve our small businesses. Thank you, KIVA, for trusting us and for funding our loans.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cMariana\u201d Trust Bank meet each month to make payments on their loans and participate in educational seminars. As most of them have had little or no education, they are motivated to learn how to manage their loans, and so the information provided by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer is most useful and helpful. The women learn about budgeting, marketing, pricing and customer service. They also learn about indebtedness. Their home lives are enhanced when they learn about hygiene, health and nutrition as well as the use of medicinal plants. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d, and it is a partnership that is most effective.\r\n\r\nHaving been through several loan cycles with Friendship Bridge, the ladies of the \u201cMariana\u201d Trust Bank have proven themselves to be responsible and trustworthy. They anticipate that this new loan cycle will be very successful, both for themselves and their businesses. Thank you, KIVA investors, for your generosity in funding their loans!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":1630718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

Homa Bay county is located in south-western Kenya, and borders onto Lake Victoria, the second-largest lake in the world. Populations are dense close to the lake, where many individuals make their living from fishing, and a few work in the small but slowly growing tourism industry. A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nFlorence is married and has six children.

She works with her husband and together, they have seen great success. In her words \u201cMy business has grown and my personal life is good.\u201d  She will use this loan to purchase inventory for the store such as rice, sugar, oil, noodles etc. She hopes to continue working with Friendship Bridge so she can continue to succeed and grow in her personal and business life. \r\n\r\nThese women are full of ambition and positivity, despite hardships they have encountered in the past.

\u201cTierra de los Duraznos,\u201d or \u201cLand of the Peaches,\u201d located in the municipality of Chichicastenango in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. Here, there are acres of apple, plum and, of course, peach trees that the Trust Bank is named for. The ladies are a tightly knit group and share the common goal of leaving poverty behind, empowering themselves and improving their standard of living. Their average age is 39 years, and they have an average of two years of education. They have an average of four children.\r\n\r\nJuana, who is 36 years of age with one year of formal education, is the current president of the Trust Bank. She is married with four children and has a small business selling undergarments for women, socks, hats and clothing for babies. She has a small storefront in the local market where she sells these items. Therefore, Juana is requesting a loan in order to purchase new merchandise to fill up her clothing store. Juana works harder than ever now because two of her children are in middle school, and her other two are about to complete primary school. Juana and her husband want to have enough income from the business to see the children complete their education because they realize how important it is for a successful and prosperous future.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank benefits greatly from the educational seminars given during the monthly meetings by a Friendshp Bridge Loan Officer. For some, this is the first opportunity they have had to learn about topics like nutrition, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. It is essential that they know about how to construct an effective business plan and manage their businesses, and so the seminars on budgeting, marketing, accounting, customer service and pricing are essential topics that are covered. They also learn about violence against women, self-esteem and women\u2019s rights.\r\n\r\nFriendship Bridge finds that the combination of the loans and education, called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is a wonderful and effective way for the women to empower themselves and eliminate poverty. Kiva investors are greatly appreciated for their willingness and kindness to fund these small loans. We look forward to reporting on the women of the \u201cTierra de los Duraznos\u201d Trust Bank in the very near future!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4550,"image":{"id":1633463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new merchandise to fill up her clothing store.

Road,\" is located in a rural area of Chichicastenango called Chuchipaca in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. There are ladies in the Trust Bank who have various businesses such as traditional textile production, convenience stores, and small orchards where they grow peaches and apples.\r\n\r\nLidia is a 23-year-old secretary of the Trust Bank who is married with one small daughter. She has a \u201ccarnicer\u00eda\u201d or a meat store located in the community that was begun by her family several years ago. Lidia, along with her mother, is the current owner of the business. She has applied for a loan that she will use to purchase more fresh meat, as there is much demand in the area. Her customers would rather buy from her rather than traveling to the center of the town. Lidia is quite happy that she has such a faithful clientele because she looks forward to increasing her income and improving the lifestyle of her family.\r\n\r\nLidia and the ladies in the Trust Bank are most aware of the value of education. Most of them have had little or no formal education. Lidia is unique in the group because she has had nine years of formal education. She wants her daughter to have access to many years of formal education and is committed to creating a positive and healthy environment for the little girl. \r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank benefit from the educational component of their monthly meetings, when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares valuable and practical information with them on how to successfully manage their loans, take care of their families, empower themselves and eliminate poverty in their lives. The combination of the educational piece and loans is what Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is so important for these women to break the cycle of poverty and transform themselves and future generations of daughters, mothers, sisters, aunts, cousins and grandmothers. The \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program is a valuable way for the women of the \u201cLuz del Camino\u201d Trust Bank to light the road ahead and create a more prosperous future.

loans!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1633440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

The ladies are also looking forward to the educational components of their monthly meetings, when they learn about how to manage their loans with information on effective business practices, accounting, budgeting, marketing and customer service. They can support their families more effectively as they learn about health, hygiene and how to get their children ready for school.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflowers, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nMargaret is married and has four children. Both she and her husband are farmers. They have been farming for twenty years now, and they are currently growing maize, beans, sorghum, groundnuts and sunflowers on their farm. Margaret is excited about beekeeping, as it is an easy enterprise to undertake, and it will earn her some income from the sale of honey and provide her with honey for food.\r\n\r\nThis is Margaret\u2019s first loan with Honey Care. She plans to use the proceeds from her beehives to pay school fees for her children.
