This new loan was used for increasing their pig businesses by purchasing new piglets or quality feed. The group received an increased loan amount. Each of them got 2.000.000 IDR.\r\n\r\nLuh used her loan to purchase three super quality piglets for fattening. With her own money, she purchased feed and renovated the cage.

Ibrahima wishes to have his own workshop and to work for himself, since he has many customers of his own who will volunteerily follow him wherever he goes. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1635434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizer for farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2014-06-29T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-29T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":42.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahima","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.53,"local_amount":78042.5,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81540.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.56,"payment_id":624412014},{"amount":53.1,"local_amount":28383.02,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":29655.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.4,"payment_id":636760465},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":13765.39,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":14382.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.32,"payment_id":649751325},{"amount":58.53,"local_amount":29809.09,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":31145.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.05,"payment_id":665241030}],"funded_date":"2014-07-25T03:01:59Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T15:43:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":729655,"name":"Kasia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kasia is a 36-year-old married woman with two children.

She is in her 50s. Anjelina, who is divorced, has been taking care of her family with a food selling business (known as a mamalishe). She has been in this business for nine years now. She cooks rice, bananas and ugali with meat, beans, vegetables and sometimes fish. She also serves breakfast: soup and tea with donuts, chapati and other snacks. She starts business very early in the morning, at 4:30 a.m., when she organizes food ingredients that are required for that day, like going to the butcher to find fresh and healthier meat.  She has business helpers, and all business issues end by midnight daily. She is able to make a good profit monthly. \r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. Anjelina will use this loan to buy food cooking ingredients (rice, beans, sugar, cooking oil, a sack of maize and baking flour). She dreams that one day she will be able to own a hotel together with a chips business. \r\n\r\nAnjelina will share this loan with her loan group, \"KUSUDIO,\" which totals three members.

She wants to finish college to have a profitable and stable job someday.  According to her, it is her dream to help her parents with their everyday expenses.

She and the other group members are best friends, who came together to apply for a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner Al Majmoua. Nadira is a 45-year-old married mother of five whose husband works in construction. She is Palestinian, and since refugees are limited to certain work in sectors, she has faced many difficulties in life. She quit school at the intermediate level, which further limits her working opportunities. Despite these obstacles, two years ago Nadira started renting out apartments to help cover the costs of sending her children to a private school.

Ana sells fruits and vegetables, and her husband grows crops in greenhouses. Ana helps her husband care for his crops, as do the couple's children when they are not in school and have free time. \r\n\r\nAna says that she's sold produce since she was a girl, and her parents still grow crops and sell them at markets. Ana doesn't have a fixed location, and works in markets near her town, also taking orders from customers. Ana sells at markets in the mornings and afternoons, earning an income to help her family. When her children aren't in school, they help their mother prepare to work. \r\n\r\nAna will use the funds from this loan to invest in and expand her business, purchasing more fruits and vegetables. This additional inventory will allow her to offer a greater variety of products to her customers and earn more income for the business. Lacking the capital for these investments, Ana requires a loan. \r\n\r\nAna has always wanted to boost her sales and have her own location, which would simplify her work as she wouldn't have to travel to markets in order to sell her produce. Ana also hopes that her husband can expand his crops and achieve a bigger harvest.

She is married to Carlos, who is a soldier and they have children. Together with her husband, Amy manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAmy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nAmy dreams for her business to grow bigger and hopes to have a better living.

She was encouraged by other Cama (Camfed\u2019s alumni network) members to venture into business so that she could look after her family. During her spare time, Dephine volunteers as a Learner Guide delivering life skills education sessions to students in schools.

After his wife's treatment ran its course and they returned to Beregovo, Ishtvan bought a small car and started working again by himself; in addition, he continued the renovation of their home from where he left off.  With time, Ishtvan hopes to pay back the previous loan he took out, as well as hire another crew for work; for the time being, he would like to improve his family's living conditions, and is seeking

She has a minor child who is still in primary school. She is a native of Chinandega, located in the western part of the country. She started her businesses with her own funds from savings that she had, and they consist of selling tamales pisques [tamales with a bean filling], ice, beans, firewood, and nacatamales [Nicaraguan tamales], among others, which she does with great care. Her day starts the night before with making the ice, a process that is very simple, easy, and fast, and which consists of putting water in a bag and then tying it up, and with selling tamales. That process is a bit long because she has to prepare the corn with lime, adding the lime to the corn and putting it on the stove, cooking it on low heat. Then it is washed and afterwards it is put on the fire, adding ash to the corn until it remains yellow. Then it is washed again, ready to be ground. Banana leaves are bought and the masa is placed inside. The tamale is closed and cooked again until it is ready to eat. The process for the delicious nacatamales is almost the same, with the only difference being that the nacatamales are not treated with ash but rather once the corn is prepared with lime it is washed and sent to be ground. Then it is mixed and cooked with pig lard. Afterwards it is left to cool while the pig meat is seasoned with all the ingredients that are added to it such as achiote to give it a little color, vinegar, and salt. Then tomatoes, onion, mint, sweet peppers, potatoes, rice, chiles, and raisins are added. After taking it off the flame it is placed in the banana leaves, tied, and put on a low heat until it is very well cooked and ready to sell. She only works on this business on the weekends, which is when she has more demand. She buys the firewood from firewood merchants who offer it to her at her home. She learned these businesses thanks to her mother from the time she was very young, since they had few economic resources. Every day she gets up very early to perform her work. She has regular and casual customers. She makes her purchases in cash. One of her dreams is to be able to have her own house and give her daughter a better future. Her desire is for her daughter to go to college, prepare herself, and have a better standard of living than she has had. The goal of this new loan is to invest in her businesses by buying products to make the delicious nacatamales and tamales pisques, to buy firewood, and to be able to fulfill the demand she has from her customers so that in a not-too-distant future she can have more income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1630446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is single and lives in the Shurugwi District of Zimbabwe. She has been successfully rearing broiler chickens for four months, producing 25 birds every six weeks.
