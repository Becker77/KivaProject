last thirteen years. She trades in agricultural produce on a small scale, working seven days a week. In addition to the produce business, she also buys and sells cattle at a profit, which has helped her meet the needs of her family. <br \/><br \/>Rose thanks Kiva lenders for the previous loan which she used to buy produce and make profits. She would like to use this loan (5,000,000 UGX) to buy more produce, in the form of dry corn and beans.  She will sell this and earn profits, which will be used to expand her business and educate her children. Her clients are mainly school owners who buy beans and corn as food for their students. Her biggest challenge is delayed payments, since some people take items on credit with the hope of paying back in time, which they never do.

He does not read or write, because when he was the age to go to school there where no schools where he lived. To go to school it was necessary to travel far from his home. It was very difficult for his family to arrange for such travel, and combined with their financial situation, they were not able to send him to school.\r\n\r\nDavid is married and he does not have any children. His wife does the household work in their home where only he and his wife live.\r\n\r\nDavid works buying and selling cattle. He says that he started working in this business because, when he was little, he worked helping an uncle bring the cattle to his house. It was then that he realized that he liked this type of work, so he decided to start his own cattle business, which he has had now for over 20 years. He says that he buys cattle in various parts of the country on the basis of information from business contacts or customers. He then hauls the cattle to his house in cattle trucks. His wife helps him with the things she can. He does not have a fixed work schedule, because he needs to sleep away from home when he travels the long distances to the different places where he buys cattle.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan from CrediCampo to buy dairy cattle, as sales for the \"Criollo\" breed of cattle are low. He would like to buy dairy cows to increase his profits and pay for household expenses. He hopes to give his wife a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn the future, David would like to have a large cattle transportation business so that he and his wife could enjoy a better quality of life. He says that all of this could be possible and his dream could become reality thanks to this loan and possibly another larger loan in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":760.11,"image":{"id":1633389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has a small plantation and vegetable garden business, from which she sells to the members of her community and also to the traveling public. She started operating this last year, but she needs financial assistance to expand and further improve her plantation and vegetable garden. Therefore, she has just joined the SPBD program to gain access to financial assistance. With this money, she plans to purchase chemicals, a mist blower, fencing wire, vegetable seeds, and bush knives.

Los \u00faltimos 3 meses no se ha logrado una buena producci\u00f3n en la pesca y muchos de los clientes han desaparecido de las ciudades donde se les entregaba el marisco.\nPese a los peligros de robo de embarcaciones y motores. Espera en 3 a\u00f1os haber crecido en clientes y mejorar sus resultados en la pesca diaria.\n\nFelicita el proceso de cr\u00e9dito de esta organizaci\u00f3n, ya que es una buena ayuda al artesano. No se pide garant\u00edas para estos cr\u00e9ditos y no piden muchos requisitos como en los bancos.\nEs una buena oportunidad para los peque\u00f1os empresarios.\n\n\n","en":"Mariano is 51 years old and lives with his wife and 2 of his 4 children. The older two children have their own families and live in other cities. His wife takes care of the household chores and plants cocoa in a small farm.\r\n\r\nHe is very grateful for his partners' responsibility in the loan process and lifts his thanks to God for the opportunity that He offers through FODEMI to improve the quality of live in his community with small loans.\r\n\r\n\"The previous loan served me well since I could complete the process of getting identity documents for my children and acquire merchandise (shellfish) to improve sales,\" says Mariano. \"I have always worked in fishing and with the current loan, I will purchase a new net to improve the daily results from fishing and be able to offer better products to the community.\"\r\n\r\nHe sells the product of his work in Esmeraldas, Borb\u00f3n and San Lorenzo. For the past 3 months, he has not been able to have a good result of his fishing and many of his customers have left to the cities where they get their shellfish, due to the dangers of theft of boats and motors.  He hopes in three years to have grown in his customer base and improve the daily results from his fishing.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful for the loan process of this organization, since it is a good help to the artisan. They don't ask for guarantees for these loans and don't have as many requirements as banks do.\r\n\r\nThis is a good opportunity for the small businesspeople.

They also prepare pastries and sweets of every flavor. Their shop is very busy as there is not another one nearby, so their sales are very good. They have been engaged in this business for five years, and with that they are moving forward in life. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy flour, eggs and other ingredients for preparing the bread.

She is 35 years old, married, and mother to 4 children: two boys and two girls. Her business consists of processing peanuts into a paste that she sells in the sub-region's weekly international market. To do this, she buys peanuts by the bag or by the tub, depending on what is available at the market, and sorts them, cooks them, and then processes them by machine into  peanut butter that she sells in 15- or 20-liter buckets. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans on buying four 50-kilo bags of peanuts at 12,500 CFA Francs each that she will process and sell. The income will enable her to help her husband manage the family's daily expenses, and also increase her savings.

She is an uneducated woman and works as a housewife. Her husband is an employee in a public sector. The salary that he receives from his job is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family. Shifa's house lacks a refrigerator and she can't afford this thing. Inside the kitchen of her house, she puts many kinds of drinks, foods, sweets, and vegetables without a refrigerator where they need to be in a cold condition.

For this reason, she would like a loan of PHP5,000 to buy flour, sugar, milk, rice cakes, banana cue and coconut juice to cook and sell. Being a kind and industrious mother, Lorna hopes that someday she will make her business more profitable.

experience. He started his career milking the animals on a farm and, little by little, saved up the money to buy his own cows. He continued this until he had a good-sized herd. Due to a bit of bad business, however, Jaime lost everything. Now that he has two young daughters, Jaime wants to start up his business from scratch again. As a result he is applying for a loan in order to buy calves and one month's worth of feed. \r\n\r\nJaime tells us that it is important to be able to rise up again and start from nothing. More than anything else, Jaime's daughters are his biggest motivation to become a milk producer like he was many years ago, if not better.

She is currently 50 years old and has five schooling children(Secondary and college level). She is known for being a good milk seller on her street. Bupe's cows have big calves, so she cannot produce enough liters of milk to meet people's demand as usual. She plans to buy better and healthier food to feed her cows so they give more milk to manage the demands of the market. She is also a poultry mother, keeping local chickens just for laying eggs to resell. Bupe has a plan to use the same poultry skills with little in addition to grow broilers for selling. She is really always a busy mother. She does her activities from 6 am to 6 pm daily and is able to get 10 liters of milk with good profit. She has been in the agricultural business since 2011.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting her ninth loan via Kiva's partner, Tujijenge Tanzania. Bupe used the previous loans (all of which she paid back successfully) to buy food to feed her cows and chickens. Bupe earned a profit, which she used to cover school fees and paid part of her home food expenses. She will use this loan to buy better food for her cows so as to give out more liters of milk and buy chicks for her new poultry business.

All of their children attend school. \r\n\r\nApproximately 15 years ago, Pedro decided to become a farmer. Before, he had worked as an assistant but since he is married now, he decided it would be more profitable to raise his own crops and grow food for his home. Pedro learned this trade from his father, who showed him how to earn a living on his own. That is how Pedro decided that this year he would sow 7,000 square meters of corn and beans.
