Most of these members are into the sale of clothing. \r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Rebecca. She says that she joined ID-Ghana five years ago after receiving an invitation from a promoter from the organization who visited her at her house. Rebecca currently has a business where she sells Kekkey (cooked corn paste) and fish. She became knowledgeable about selling this type of product by learning the trade from her mother when she was a young girl. Rebecca helped her mother with her business, but after she got married, she decided to establish her own independent business. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying corn dough to prepare kenkey and fish. She acquires her merchandise at the fairs in the city of Accra to prepare her kenkey, and then sells from her house. Working in this manner enables her to generate income to support her family. Rebecca is married and has one child who depends on them. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about ID-Ghana, Rebecca said that she enjoys the training seminars offered by the organization.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1633946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

year old farmer who went to school up to the 3rd grade, since his parents weren't able to send him to school for financial reasons. Currently he's married and he and his wife have two kids, neither of whom live with him because they formed their own households. Isidro has practically been a farmer since he was 14 and ever since he has grown corn and beans. He inherited two hectares of land from his deceased father and that's where he's planting this year. His departed dad taught him this work and he's been farming ever since. The loan he's requesting from CREDICAMPO is to purchase manure, fertilizers and pay day laborers to help him plant his crop. Distance-wise his crop is basically located right next to his house since he's farming the land he inherited from his father. Isidro has one desire in life and he knows he can achieve it with lots of work and determination, it's to have a respectable home and live with his wife in a place that's more protected from the

He is also part of the ADESCO [a community development organization] directive of his community. He is not married and has no children. He lives with his mother and his father.\r\n\r\nCarlos is a very hard-working person who knows no obstacles to doing any kind of work. He gets up every day at 5 in the morning to work in agriculture, since he rents some land to work. He plants corn. This year he has planted a hectare of land. He learned this work from his father, who is also a farmer. The distance that he has to walk to go to his fields isn't much, since it's only a kilometer away.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is applying for is to buy more compost for his planting of corn. The crop is already planted, and he has also already done the first application of compost. Two applications of compost are [still] needed, and he doesn't have the cash to pay for them.\r\n\r\nHe plans to get two harvests in a year, since last year it was very profitable for him and produced 62 quintals [a quintal is approximately 100 lbs] of corn. Now this year he is going to make two harvests, and he knows that he can achieve it with the help of his loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1634619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

a farmer from the area.  He studied through the fifth grade at the school in his canton.  Luis could not continue his studies at the time because his parents were responsible for his educational expenses.  Since the economic crisis at the time was very hard, they could not help him continue his studies.  Luis is currently in a relationship, but does not have children.  <br \/><br \/>He has already worked in agriculture for 10 years.  The trade was passed down from his father, who taught him how to cultivate corn and beans.  However, three years ago, a friend introduced him to raising livestock, especially buying and selling cattle.  Luis also buys cattle for grazing.  Now that he spends time in both activities, farming and raising livestock, he is doing well in both of them.  <br \/><br \/>The money from this loan will be invested in the purchase of supplies for cultivating corn.  This year he will be planting two hectares of corn, so he will buy 18 sacks of compost valued at $48\/each, which comes to a total of $864.  Luis already has $200 for other expenses, so he only needs $800 to take of care of these needs and move forward with his planting.  <br \/><br \/>He hopes to achieve the best crop possible.  This loan will enable him to provide the best care to his crops so that they remain free of pests.  Luis knows that he can sell a high quality product and generate good profits so that he can repay his loan.  In addition, his earnings can be reinvested into the next crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1631619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 18 sacks of compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-01T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-31T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis \u00c1ngel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300.05,"local_amount":300.05,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":300.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545817},{"amount":499.95,"local_amount":499.95,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":499.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611770129}],"funded_date":"2014-07-27T16:30:44Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":730584,"name":"Abdulhafez","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdulhafez is 21 years old.

Meet Robert, a passionate, hardworking smallholder farmer from Murang\u2019a, which is a coffee producing area in Kenya. Robert is very ingrained to coffee farming. For the last 10 years, he has supported his family of children through income he generates from selling coffee. \r\n\r\nThe major challenge Robert is facing as a farmer is unavailability of cheap and affordable labor. He is forced to handle most of the work by himself. For this reason, he decided to purchase some assets that will make his work easier. Robert is seeking a loan from KIVA through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a water pump and farm implements.\r\n\r\nThe water pump will replace the labor required to fetch and water the crops on his farm.

He is a husband, a father, and a smallholder farmer who resides in Kerugoya on a small piece of land together with his family. Patrick has been passionately practicing mixed-farming for the past 6 years. His primary income sources are milk, tea, greeneries, and other personal businesses.\r\n\r\nPatrick stated that he enjoys keeping cattle: He names all animals in his farm. His biggest challenge is the marketing of farm produce. He is seeking a loan to purchase chaff cutter and farm implements. A chaff cutter will be used to chop fodder into small pieces for a compact storage and to make it more digestible.

Due to financial circumstances and household needs, he was not able to continue.  For this reason, he decided to work as a driver.  Mario is in a relationship and his partner sells dairy products.  She buys milk and uses it to make other products to sell.  They have two children, ages 3 and 5 respectively.  <br \/><br \/>In his work as a driver, Mario travels in a pick-up truck on his given route that measures about 100 kilometers.  He has been in this line of work for more than six years.  Mario learned to drive using his brother\u2019s car and later began using his own vehicle.  He has no other jobs.  The place where he begins his workday is located approximately 500 meters away, so he must travel on foot in order to retrieve the pick-up truck that he will drive.  His work schedule is from 5:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M.  <br \/> <br \/>His loan will be invested in repairs to the roof of his house, which is in bad condition.  It leaks whenever it rains, which creates an uncomfortable situation for his wife and children.  Mario will buy wood and tiles, as well as pay for labor.  This loan will provide the capital he needs to make this home improvement.  <br \/><br \/>Mario wants to provide the most urgent necessities for himself and his family.  He hopes to continue working as long as God gives him health and life.  This loan will satisfy his family\u2019s need for home repairs.  With what he earns from his job, Mario will set aside part of it for his loan payment and the rest will go toward household

His dream is to see his business flourish and he knows that for this reason, he has to invest a little more in purchasing more musical items, so that he can meet the demand.

She planned to purchase more sound boxes, sound systems, dishes, and drums with the loan to attract more clients so she can achieve her goal of improving the quality of life of her family.

Guatemala, is well-known among travelers for its huge and colorful Thursday and Sunday markets. Many of the narrow streets are of old cobblestones, and the buildings are roofed with red tiles. This picturesque setting disguises the poverty that the majority of the citizens of Chichicastenango experience on a daily basis. The unstable economy of the country has a drastic effect on poor families. The majority of the households are sustained by women who do their best to take care of their families with very limited resources.\r\n\r\nCecilia is the president of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Angelitas,\u201d meaning \u201cThe Little Angels.\u201d She is widowed and works quite hard to take care of her six children. Cecilia is on her third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. She has a textile business and sells traditional blouses (\u201chuipiles\u201d) and skirts (\u201ccortes\u201d) throughout the country. Cecilia is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase thread and other supplies. She plans to diversify her designs to attract new clientele and increase her income.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank would not be as successful in their personal and business lives if it wasn\u2019t for the educational component of their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer, sensitive to their needs and desires, presents short seminars on a variety of timely subjects, and the women are very eager to learn. Empowered by the information, they can design a business plan, learn about accounting, budgeting, marketing and pricing. The ladies also learn about health, nutrition, the use of medicinal plants, and hygiene. \r\n\r\nCecilia emphasizes that this educational component is very valuable and makes the women even more empowered and successful.

She is married to Dinesh, age 56 years. Lalita studied till grade 8 and her husband has a secondary education. They have two sons. Both of their sons are students. One is in grade 7; the other is in college.\r\n\r\nLalita's husband is a farmer. He grows different vegetables in different seasons. But his income is scanty to cover all the expenses of the family. So to help her husband, Lalita is also engaged in livestock breeding. A few years ago, she established herself in raising dairy cows for a milk supply business.  She works seven days a week, five hours a day to support her family. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in rural India, especially in West Bengal. Cows are raised for their milk to make butter, curd and paneer (cottage cheese). In addition, milk cows provide cow dung, which is used as fuel for fires and good manure in agricultural lands. So raising dairy cows is a profitable business. \r\n\r\nAt present, Lalita has two cows in her herd. She wants to increase the number, which can be possible through a loan. So Lalita has taken a loan from Kiva's partner BJS to purchase one more dairy cow to further extend her milk supply and milk products business. Lalita plans to improve the economic condition of her family by the additional income and provide better education to her children.\r\n\r\nShe thanks her lenders for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1634027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

They have their own plot of land, where they work from dawn to dusk.  Her goal is to forge ahead and provide a more financially secure life for her sons and her family.  But the income from this business is very inconsistent and at the same time insufficient to cover all the necessary expenses of the family.  She cannot invest much in this business due to lack of capital.  Now she has decided to grow jute, which is a profitable crop.\r\n\r\nNiyati heard that BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) gives business loans to needy rural women.

Jalpaiguri. She has a fundamental education, having studied untill grade 4. She is a mother of two grown sons who are engaged in small business. One of her sons is engaged in a carpentry business.\r\n\r\nFor the last few years, Maya's son Gobinda, age 28 years, has been a carpenter. His business is located in a good area and his primary customers are the local people who want to furnish their houses. He mainly makes wooden furniture like tables, chairs, benches, wardrobes, etc. He is hardworking, ambitious and determined to establish himself in this business, as he is the main breadwinner for the family.  \r\n\r\nMaya's other son's income is inconsistent, so the total household expenses depend on this carpentry business. Maya's biggest challenge is the high cost of products, which makes it difficult to expand the business.\r\n\r\nMaya came to know from her neighbors that BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) gives business loans, so she took a loan from them to help her son to grow the business. She will purchase additional stock of carpentry materials such as wood, tools etc. She hopes this will enable him to generate more income to support the family financially.

Her income from the business is helping with her everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for each item in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMarifel is requesting a loan to purchase more groceries to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants to live a better life and she hopes to help her siblings complete their studies.\r\n\r\nEvery week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Jashoda is illiterate and can sign her name only. They have two sons. Both of their sons are engaged in vegetable business.\r\n\r\nJashoda 's husband is a farmer. He grows different vegetables in different seasons. But his income is scanty to cover all the expenses of the family. So to help her husband, Jashoda is also engaged in livestock breeding. A few years ago, she established a dairy business. She works seven days a week, five hours a day to support her family. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in rural India, especially in West Bengal. Cows are raised for their milk to make butter, curd and paneer (cottage cheese). In addition to producing milk, cows provide cow dung, which is used as fuel for fires and as good manure in agricultural lands. So raising cows is a profitable business.  \r\n\r\nAt present, Jashoda has two cows. She wants to increase the number of livestock, which can be possible through a loan, so Jashoda has taken a loan from Kiva's partner BJS to purchase one more cow to further extend her milk supply and milk products business. \r\n\r\nJashoda plans to improve the economic condition of her family by the additional income and hopes to purchase an auto-rickshaw in future.\r\n\r\nShe thanks her lenders for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1633952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

They are blessed with two small sons: one is a student in grade 3 and the other is too young for school. They have a small kachha house made of straw, bamboo and mud.\r\n\r\nKalpana's husband has been involved in vegetable farming for a long time. As he has no land of his own, he leased some land and started vegetable cultivation on a small scale. He started with a limited supply of vegetables, such as tomatoes, potatoes, beans, etc. He has developed a very good relationship with his customers as he sells fresh and high quality vegetables. Now he has a new idea of doing paddy cultivation, for which he needs capital.\r\n\r\nSo, Kalpana has requested a loan from Kiva's partner Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS). The loan will help her purchase paddy seeds, fertilizers and insecticides. She hopes to get a good profit from this new business to reach her goals of strengthening the family economy and educating her sons properly so that they can get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks

Their sons are deprived of education due to their poverty.  Now they work as laborers on daily wages.\r\n\r\nAnna's husband is engaged in a small business of supplying food items.  He buys different snack items from wholesale markets and supplies local shops.  He and his sons have no consistent income.  So it is hardly possible for them to bear all the household costs of a family of four members.\r\n\r\nNow, Anna wants to start a business selling puffed rice to help the family financially.  It is a very common and popular snack in India. It is made by heating sand in a pot and then throwing grains of rice into the heated sand.  The rice puffs up and is separated from the sand with a strainer.  Puffed rice is used on a wide variety of secular and religious occasions or even just to munch plain.\r\n\r\nAnna has taken out a loan from Kiva's partner Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS) to purchase required ingredients for her puffed rice business.  She hopes it will enable her to fulfill the demand of the local market, and she will earn more profit through this business to cope with the growing expenses of her family.

Aside from this, Purita also operates her food vending business as her additional source of income.\r\n\r\nWelding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. This is often done by melting the work pieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to become a strong joint, with pressure sometimes used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld. She also operates a vulcanizing business and offers electrical services as well. She earns a minimum of Php450 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more equipment for their business, and also items that are used to maintain their equipment. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands the business.\r\n\r\nPurita dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to be able to save for other needs of her family and for future business expenditures. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is from a rural area and is 41 years old. She is also married and has five children. She got married after finishing high school and did not continue her studies, so she does not have a college education. Kimatoy has planted crops for over 20 years, mainly vegetables and grains. She sells her crops at the local market. A few months ago her husband came back from Russia and now he helps her with the business. Kimatoy wants to plant for a second harvest but does not have the money to buy seeds and fertilizer. She is requesting a loan to buy these things and awaits your kindness.

But by the grace of God, they were able to raise their child well and they are helping each other to work for their family.\r\n\r\nJelita owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their house. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg and other items. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price and she will sell it per piece for a higher price to earn a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby and the people in the community. She earns PHP 300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting an PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nJelita desires that her business will continue to grow and she hopes that her family will always be in good health. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1635751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-01T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-31T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.35,"local_amount":3733.31,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4094.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517182},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000142},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1754.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491665}],"funded_date":"2014-07-01T22:58:18Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":730935,"name":"Ivan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ivan is a twenty-two-year-old married male with one child and two dependents and lives in Bundibugyo Uganda.

She is a mother of five children, two of whom are in school. She struggles to make a living and to cover school expenses through one hectare of rice farming which she has occupied for about seven years already. The agribusiness has returned an average of 38,300 KHR per day. Mon is the leader of a group of two members. This is the third cycle for her and the first time for her partner to request for a loan from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The group has applied for a loan of 1,3000,000 KHR, of which Mon owns a portion of 700,000 KHR.

She struggles to earn a living and to pay for school expenses of her two children who are currently in school through the 5 hectares area of rice farming. This business has been the main source of income for her family for 15 years. \r\n\r\nThis is the 6th cycle for Veoun and her partner as a borrower of VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). They have successfully repaid the past loan and it has allowed them to gradually improve their living condition.
