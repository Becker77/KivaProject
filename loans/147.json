This is 39-year-old Margreth L. from Dar es Salaam. She is widowed with five children between the ages of 6 and 21. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans.\r\n\r\nMargreth has been running a poultry business since 2003. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.\r\n\r\nMargreth works at the business for 10 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by her children. She currently earns about $400 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Margreth thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Based on his understanding of the retail perfume business and his talent for working with the public, he knew he could run a successful perfume store.  He even knew where he wanted to open his store - in a kiosk at a mall.  But this Brazilian native wanted to be smart about financing his business.\r\n\r\nRonieri could have used credit cards to finance the purchase of his new kiosk and his initial inventory, but he was well aware of the high interest rate he'd have to pay.  So he contacted a government loan program and began their loan application process.  Unfortunately, they weren't used to dealing with a smaller retail start-up business, and asked for mountains of paperwork and documentation.  Ronieri was getting frustrated by the time and effort required to borrow money.\r\n\r\nThen he decided to contact ACCION USA.  Since he had so much of his paperwork already in order, his loan approval was quite quick.  He set-up his kiosk and has already hired part-time help.  Ronieri is hoping, one day, to expand into a storefront in the same mall.  When he does, he hopes to have another positive experience working with ACCION USA to get his financing.\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA: \r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Dilrabokhon is 38 years old and is married with three children. She sells sweets (candies), preserved food, juices, soft drinks and also detergents in her grocery store. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Dilrabokhon is respectful and patient with all of her customers which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again.\r\n\r\nDilrabokhon is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of 4,000 Somoni to increase the inventory she has for sale. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help her reach all of her aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Her customers say good things about her, since she lets them pay for the clothes in instalments and the embroidery she does is very creative and beautiful.  She feels very happy and excited requesting the loan, since she will be able to grow her business and increase her sales.  She wants this loan so that she can become known in other communities; she needs a large amount of stock in order to sell outside of her community.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":34139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of seafood products (oysters, dried fish, shellfish, etc.) from local fishermen; storage and transport to market for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Ndiaye Ndiaye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.55 -16.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-05-29T21:48:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-13T04:28:37Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27568},{"amount":9,"local_amount":9,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:13:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41464},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:12:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50209},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:41:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63349},{"amount":173,"local_amount":173,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80053},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:39:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93789},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106887},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:59:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136709},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170169},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197314},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224305}],"funded_date":"2007-05-30T04:28:37Z","paid_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13886,"name":"Mariette","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Se\u00f1ora Mariette dedicates her self to selling food at night.

As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International four years ago, he was able to make much progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming.\r\n\r\nThen, Jamoliddin saw a new business opportunity: rearing calves, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. Given this loan, he will purchase calves and feed for them to expand his business.\r\n\r\nJamoliddin plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lamulatu is 21 years-old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has two children.  Lamulatu has a business managing a retail store, which sells various small goods, in Kyotera.  Lamulatu has had her retail business for approximately one-and-a-half years.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Lamulatu is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy goods to resell and obtain more inventory for her retail shop.  Lamulatu hopes to expand her business and gain more clients in order to generate profits for her family.  \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. First, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer youth a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and to target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The area is in the La Libertad region, an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe is in business selling groceries and household necessities, from a store in her home. She provides her customers with all sorts of everyday products, which they used to have to go all the way to the district market to buy. Nieves likes to make sure her customers always find the quality goods they want in her shop. Together with her friendly manner, this has meant she now has a group of loyal customers who choose to make their purchases in her shop. Her husband works driving a mototaxi (which is a motorcyle with a cab on the back that is used for transporting goods or passengers). With the two incomes they share in the running of their home.\r\n\r\nNieves wants to grow her business by purchasing additional stock to offer her customers, so she has requested a loan of 2000 soles from [field partner] Edpyme Alternativa that will help her realize her aims.

She sells and makes food as a source of income and has had the business for over 10 years.  Her business is located in the market.  In the beginning, she had very little capital but had the will to get ahead since she had to pay the household expenses and give her children a good education and food.  Little by little she increased her inventory with very little earnings but her customers kept coming back since Rosa\u2019s attention to her customers is very good and she always greets them with a smile on her lips.

He is married with four children. Ziyodullo is a strong and persevering person, intent on improving his family\u2019s standard of living. <p>\r\nZiyodullo is a farmer, and he has been in this business for four years. He grows agricultural crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, potatoes, and wheat. His brothers help him with the business. Each year Ziyodullo grows a sufficient amount of crops for his family's consumption and to sell the rest of his yield for a profit. By generating a stable income, Ziyodullo is able to support his large family; however, sometimes his income is not enough to provide for the most elemental needs of the family because he supports not only his wife and children but also his brother and sister. <p>\r\nSo, he wants to increase productivity on his plot, which requires an infusion of capital in order to produce a larger crop yield.

Thi Houng, #09010010, is 32 yrs old and lives with her husband and 2 young children. Her family has many business activities for their income: raising chickens for eggs, ducks for meat, sows for breeding and meat, selling construction materials. In addition to raising animals, every day her husband works as a building contractor. Therefore, her family's income is quite stable ranging from 15.00 USD to 18.00 USD per day. She already went through one cycle of borrowing from the fund and repaying the loan, and she really likes this form of loan. It agrees with the goals and income of her family. This time she would like to borrow 260.00 USD to buy feed for the pigs, chickens and ducks. The other members in her group are:\r\nMr. Le Dac Chinh, #09010007, loan amount 260.00 USD to raise pigs;\r\nMr. Le Dac Tuyen, # 09010016, loan amount 195.00 USD to buy chicken feed;\r\nMs. Le Thi Hang, # 09010012, loan amount 260.00 USD to raise pigs;\r\nMS.

Two of her children study and the oldest works. Se\u00f1ora Ruth has sold various types of food and fried snacks from her house for six years. Her major difficulty is in the winter since where she sells the food there is no ceiling and the rains cause sales to drop. She began with a loan from Afodenic and this is her seventh loan request. It has already greatly helped her family. Thanks to the opportunity she has with the loan to invest, she has been able to help her children stay in school and survive, since she and her husband have separated and all of the expenses have had to be covered by her. With this request, she wants to make improvements to the roof, since her house is very short and she wants to raise the roof. She is going to buy timber for rafters amongst other materials, and repair a door in order to have better security for her family. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley,

There is a very high rate of illiteracy among adults in this community, and most families are only able to provide their children with a junior high school level education; this minimal education contributes to the high unemployment rate in Ghana, which is becoming a challenge for the government.\r\n\r\nGabriel is a seasoned farmer, having been farming cocoa and cereals such as maize for over five years. Through this he has managed to build a two-bedroom house in the village. In addition to operating his farm, Gabriel sells grocery products in a kiosk in the community in order to generate additional income to support his business.\r\n\r\nHowever, he has been having difficulties with his farm because there is a disease attacking his cocoa crops. Therefore he is applying for loan assistance to buy implements such as fertilizers, agro-chemicals and spraying machines. This will allow him to harvest more this year and in the years ahead, thereby increasing his profits so he can better support his family and his children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":267190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

They all live in the Djaka Kin district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali), and they know one another through ties of community and membership in the same traditional women's association in the area.  The group members buy and sell fish in all forms (fresh, fried, smoked, and dried). \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying their customers, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program.  After having repaid the three preceding loans, they are on their fourth solidarity loan.  This new loan will be used to buy 171 kg of fresh fish, a portion of which is sold fresh door-to-door in the Kirango area, while the the other portion is first dried in a corner of the house using a traditional dryer and then sold.  Supplies of fresh fish are gotten only on the banks of the Niger River in Kirango from their husbands who are recognized fishermen in fishing zones of Kirango.  The fish thus obtained is resold, cash or credit accepted, at the fairs of Diamarabougou, Dougabougou, and Siribala, to customers composed mostly of women.\r\n\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average monthly profit of 17,500 francs CFA that will be put into savings and used to augment their working capital.  Their ambition is to embark on small-scale livestock farming, to buy a freezer in order to preserve fresh fish for longer, and also to sell ice.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":318819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marama     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samin\u00e8                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.34,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":35971.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020261},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":17985.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243016},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":17985.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678822},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":17985.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112626},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.65,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":17985.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028193}],"funded_date":"2009-06-01T21:15:09Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":112231,"name":"Fati","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fati U. sells provisions such as Milo, sugar, canned fish, and other good provisions in Abura.

His house is located in the town of Huaylahuichan, in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nFor the last 15 years, along with his wife, Leonel has been planting potatoes, corn, and peas. With their earnings, Leonel and Flor have been able to buy two pieces of land where they have planted lots of corn (as we see in the picture). In addition, they are saving so that their kids will want for nothing, neither now, nor in the future. While his wife is in charge of hiring farm hands who clean and take care of their crops, Leonel and his brother travel to sell the corn at a market in Lima. \r\n \r\nIn his activities, Leonel is disappointed that sometimes, products lose some of their value according to the season; however, he assures us he doesn't lose anything, as he always makes a profit. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Leonel would like to have his own vehicle to transport his products to the capital city and in that way, stop paying for transportation. He'd also like to work independently of his brother in order to increase his earnings. \r\n\r\nThis is the 8th loan Leonel is receiving from Kiva partner MFP and he believes that since requesting credit and becoming a part of a communal bank, he has gotten ahead quite a bit and does not want to stop his daily work rhythm.

She is seeking a loan through which she can buy more clothing in different styles and colors; in this way she can acquire a bigger clientele, and she will also buy more shoes. She does all this with the desire to see her business and also her family economy prosper, since her husband is an employee of a private business, but in spite of this, his earnings often aren't enough to cover all the expenses. For this reason, Maria has decided to apply for a loan at Integral, with the hope of being able to improve her business and pay for everything that is difficult for her husband. In spite of the fact that Maria has a small family, she is a very hardworking woman who tries hard every day to have a better life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

En la actualidad siembra arvejas, ma\u00edz y papa, para realizar esta labor cuenta con la ayuda de sus hijos, que trabajan esforzadamente la tierra cuando no estudian. Dice que el trabajo de campo es algo tedioso, y que los resultados se aprecian cuando empieza la temporada de cosecha, pero que las ganancias son regulares ya que toda su producci\u00f3n la vende a los comerciantes mayoristas que saben de la calidad de sus productos naturales, y llegan a comprarle toda su producci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s le gusta mucho vigilar y cuidar bien sus campos para obtener una fruct\u00edfera cosecha; y como es una mujer muy emprendedora para el futuro tiene pensado sembrar en mayor cantidad , sobretodo papa y arveja, para obtener mayores ganancias. Es el s\u00e9ptimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y promete cumplir puntualmente con cada una de sus cuotas, adem\u00e1s dice que le gusta el trabajo organizado de su grupo comunal, ya que todos los integrantes son muy responsables.

Her oldest child lives in the city.  They live together in a peaceful spot on the Peruvian mountain range.  When she was very young she observed how the members of the community worked on the land.  That was how she learned to work the land for growing crops.  \r\n\r\nShe currently plants peas, corn, and potatoes.  Her children help her with this work.  They put great effort into their work when they are not studying.  She says that the fieldwork is somewhat tedious.  But, she appreciates it when the harvest season starts.  She has a steady income because she sells all of her production to the wholesale merchants.  They know the quality of her natural products, and they come to buy all of her production.  \r\n\r\nAlso, she really likes keeping an eye on her crops and taking care of them in order to get a fruitful harvest.  As a very enterprising woman, she plans to plant in greater quantity in the future.  She will plant potatoes and peas most of all in order to get greater earnings.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  She pledges to make each one of her payments on time.  Also, she says that she likes the organized work of her communal bank.  All of the members are very responsible.  Juana plans to use the requested loan to buy fertilizer and pea seeds to improve the quality of her production.  That way she hopes to continue progressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":585709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and pea seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1541.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463112}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T03:27:24Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":227802,"name":"Azar","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Azar A. 42 qoda.

She says that she was unfortunately not able to continue studying because of the bad economy that her parents experienced at the time and they had to count on the whole family. She raises hogs. She's married and has a 20-year-old son who continues to study. Each day she looks for a way to help her husband and cover her basic expenses. Epifan\u00eda sells her livestock in Ixtlahuaca. She began this business 7 years ago hoping that it would be an additional source of income that would help her family's finances. She's liked raising her animals because she knows that the income helps her son stay in school. \r\n\r\nAt this moment she feels very happy because she has the opportunity to buy supplies to continue fattening her hogs and sell them for a higher price. She also hopes that with the loan she will begin to grow her business and eventually build a bigger corral.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":396887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy flour, sugar, beans and other supplies for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-30T16:10:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tausi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868313},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757509},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146603},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984748},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015421},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740427}],"funded_date":"2009-09-30T22:51:33Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":145109,"name":"Ernestina","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ernestina tiene 32 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus 3 hijos en su casa propia.

in the Zavkhan province of western Mongolia.  He and his family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian housing tent.  His oldest son, Lhamsuren, is a college student, and his youngest, Banzragch, is in high school.  <p>\r\n\r\nBayarhuu operates a wood product-making business in his town as a partnership with a few of his friends.  He mainly produces wood items which are used in ger construction and traditional ger furniture.  His business is very popular and his customer base includes both residents of his province as well as two other adjoining provinces.  Bayarhuu started his business in 1999, and he has made much progress over the years.  He is a savvy businessman, and he is constantly looking for ways to improve his operations.  For example, because many countryside people, who are his main customers, often lack sufficient cash to purchase his products, he instead trades with them; more specifically, he might trade his wood items for flour, which he would then sell in his town for a profit.  Bayarhuu has used his business' success to build a workshop and to provide a quality life for his family.  He says, \"I want my children to be educated people and to have a good life.  I am working hard to support them.\"  He has many plans for the future, such as expanding his workshop and hiring two new assistants.  By doing so, he will be able to expand his production capacity and to begin producing a wider variety of unique and stylish furniture.  Bayarhuu is requesting a loan in the amount of 700,000 tugrug (approximately $500 USD) to purchase wood and materials for his business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank: XacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Arcelita has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Arcelita joined Kiva partner, PMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to expand shelter for her livestock. Arcelita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be her fifth from PMPC.

Golden Rosary, Brgy. Jonobjonob, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   trisikad transport, food vending and livestock. Her husband Ricarido, who is 50 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 14 to 24 years old. Luzmarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzmarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to do some maintenance work in her food stall at the local school canteen and purchase goods to resell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Luzmarie M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nLuzmarie is shown in the accompanying photo posing with the trisikad (bicycle with a sidecar for passengers) that is one of her sources of income in addition to her food vending and livestock raising activities.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF),is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Each bunch costs about 0.50 Nuevo Soles, which is equivalent to about US$ 0.16.

It is traditionally consumed in the very early mornings or late at night and is well known for its many medicinal qualities. Tomasa charges about 0.50 Nuevo Soles per glass.

Pakistan for the last 26 years. Lahore city is famous for its historical places and Punjabi foods. Munawar baji is the mother of three kids: two sons and one daughter. Her elder son runs a tailoring center. The others are enrolled in school and are getting an education. Munawar baji\u2019s husband runs a fruit-selling business. He sells seasonal fruits to the fruit sellers and also goes to the different areas and announces his products in a loud voice. Munawar baji operates a sewing clothes business. She sews clothes for her neighbors and charges them different rates. If the customer orders simple stitching, she charges $2 and if the customer asks for designer clothes, she charges $3. She saves her income in a committee and plans to renovate her house with the committee amount. She has successfully repaid her two loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan).

R. and Narcisa O. A..\r\n\r\nThis is the Limonario Solidarity Group, composed of:\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Norman Alberto J., who is engaged in the sale of ready-to-eat food and drinks.  He sells these on foot in the Nindir\u00ed neighborhood.  He has lots of customers and is known for his work.  He is married and his wife prepares some of the products that he sells, such as tacos, enchiladas, roast chicken, natural beverages, etc.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Sara Mar\u00eda H. was elected by the Group as their Coordinator for this cycle.  She sells used clothing in the Oriental Market in Managua.  She sells various types of clothing, the best quality as well as lesser quality.  She has three adolescent children.  They are attending school near where they live and they help her by selling in the community and taking orders from some of her customers.  Her husband helps her with the household expenses but he works independently.  She needs the loan to buy two lots of first quality clothing for which she has orders and which she will offer during the Mother's Day festivities.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Narcisa O. A. is the last member of this group.  She makes and sells tortillas in her house in the afternoon, and in the morning she sells bread, coffee and milk in the town.  She has seven children: some are of school age, other youngsters are working in the tax-free area, and her adolescent children help her to sell out of her house and go to school nearby.  Her husband helps her with the expenses.  He is working in Costa Rica and sends her remittances in order to help her with the household expenses.  She dreams of growing her business so she can get ahead and be able to have the amenities that would allow her to work better in her kitchen.  She will use the loan to buy ingredients such as milk, coffee, sugar, meats, vegetables and two tables to accommodate her customers.\r\n\r\nThis group originated in the city of Nindir\u00ed.  They are responsible and semi-literate but they have a great desire to better themselves.  These people pay every Monday, which is the best day to make payments, after the weekend when their sales are the best.\r\n\r\nThey are working with ADIM because one of the other clients encouraged them to form a solidarity group.  And so Sara organized her group with two close friends and obtained a loan.  They are satisfied because they feel that the institution trusts in them and they expressed that they intend to be good with their payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

The financing she is seeking is to purchase inventory items such as snacks, juices, soft drinks, bread, detergent, soap, etc.  Her greatest dream is to offer her clients good customer service and to be able to make improvements to her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":368841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73600121},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87036053},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948447},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790412},{"amount":54.95,"local_amount":1098.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1123.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681025},{"amount":51.29,"local_amount":1025.82,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075563},{"amount":43.76,"local_amount":875.23,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":894.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911586},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947433},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1022.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675715},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3067.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710106}],"funded_date":"2009-08-25T00:33:36Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":132776,"name":"Jovie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovie brought success to her family for being productive in her 'sari-sari' store (community-based store) in their village of Cutog Grande Reina Mercedes, Isabela.

They have two children who are 21 and 24 years old. Lorena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped in uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family and pay off all of her outstanding debts, while still sustaining her family's needs. Lorena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Marilou is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used as working capital and to purchase additional inventory. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Marilou from HSPFI.

Th\u1ecb (69) is a 61 year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.  Thi is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 13 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 (08.01.13 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7).\r\n\r\nThi is married and has 2 adult -aged children.  To making a living, Thi owns and operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community.  Thi has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Thi joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,253,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,159,600 VND which will be used to invest in renovating the business.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Thi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  N. Th\u1ecb T\u00e2m (70) is a 38 year-old female who is requesting a 6,159,600 VND loan to support her business in the food sector making & selling food.\r\n\r\n2.  N.

For 3 years I have been the president of EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD in the community group \u201cUnidos al Progreso\u201d (united for progress). The 12 members of our group work in retail, we call ourselves \u201cUnidos al Progreso\u201d because we believe that being united will bring us progress. I have always had the initiative to generate my own income. In order to do that, I started selling fruit candy from my home.  I also worked as a seamstress and these activities generated a small profit with which I bought more sweets. I felt that this business could move forward but I needed some capital that I did not have. For that reason, I reached out to  EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD in order to obtain a loan to help me improve my business. Who would have thought that I would now have a small shop, which I intend to continue improving with additional loans from  EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD until it is converted into a grocery store.  Today I feel very fulfilled with the support of EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD, it has not only helped me with expenses, but has also helped me provide a better quality of life for my 24 year old disabled son.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariana Hungria, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":348683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy Supplies for Shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-07-17T16:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":129,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Camila Cindy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafaela Herilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Elida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enedina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Margarita Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elizabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessica Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis David","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3025},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3025},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3025},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3025}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3025,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3035,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63166897},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3025,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3035,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592259},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3025,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3035,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027470},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3025,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3035,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939303}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T05:17:04Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T18:49:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Hungria","image":null}},{"id":124567,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret E. is married and has four dependents.
