They live in their own pacca house (concrete made).\r\n\r\nJabeda's husband owns ancestral land where he cultivates seasonal vegetables.  He has been in this agribusiness for the last 15 years. Now he has grown old and feeble, so he is unable to make the same efforts as before.  Moreover, his main challenge is capital, without which he can't grow his agribusiness.  His sons have no fixed income.  As a result, they are unable to give sufficient financial sustenance to their family. Jabeda has been engaged in her livestock business for many years.  She purchases baby goats, raises them, and then offers them for sale to the nearby markets. She has gradually improved her business and it has been a great financial help to the family.\r\n\r\nShe now wants to purchase two more goats, for which she is requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner).

He will use his profits to pay for his family's financial needs, such as school fees, and to support his siblings and sustain his business. \r\n\r\nJulius is an honest and hardworking man but is always limited by capital.

He is now taking another loan from UGAFODE of 1,000,000 Uganda shillings to buy building materials so that he can finish building his house.\r\n\r\nPeter is thankful for Kiva and UGAFODE for the financial support that has allowed him to build his first house and sustain his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1636014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy housing materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T17:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104119.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517692945},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104119.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530923175},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":104119.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676543},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104119.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561810154},{"amount":79.27,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":208239.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":595336085},{"amount":39.97,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":104119.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.03,"payment_id":611969904},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104119.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"payment_id":624410390},{"amount":76.17,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":208239.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.83,"payment_id":636758720}],"funded_date":"2014-07-28T01:00:42Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T12:49:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":731057,"name":"Mohammed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammed is a 41-year-old married man and the father of three children.

They average 44 years of age and four children each. All live in Djalakorodji, one of Bamako's neighborhoods, most of them in monogamous households.\r\n\r\nThey got to know each other through tontines in the neighborhood and their money-earning businesses. The members of the group sell condiments (onions, eggplants, etc).\r\n\r\nIn order to increase their working capital, they decided to join Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, from which they are seeking their second solidarity loan (group loan).\r\n\r\nMrs. Awa is the woman standing on the right in the photograph. She's very renowned as a condiments reseller (onions, eggplants, etc). She intends to use this loan to buy four bags of onions and three bags of eggplants.\r\n\r\nShe gets her supplies in M\u00e9dine and resells for cash in Djalakorodji, to a clientele comprising mostly women. With this loan, she intends to turn an average monthly profit of XOF 90'000. Part of it will be used to provide for her children's needs, and the remainder will be invested in her business.\r\n\r\nMrs. Awa counts a lot on this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso to reach her goal, which is to expand her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1640614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy 4 bags of onions and 3 bags of eggplants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-07-02T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-01T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":133881.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677511},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":133881.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530210451},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":133881.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658963},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":133881.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542658964},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":133881.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793142},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":133881.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758090}],"funded_date":"2014-07-07T14:47:31Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T15:26:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":731130,"name":"Maia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maia is 40-years-old.

Now, as a Babban Gona member, he finally has the access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist.

The average Babban Gona farmer harvests 30 bags of maize per hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Aliyu Bala is especially ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 40 bags per hectare this season. By doing so, Aliyu Bala will finally have enough money to make significant life changes. When asked what he plans to do with his income from this season, he said: \u201cI plan to use the money I make to provide more food and clothing for my family\u201d.

Aychurok has a secondary education. After graduating from high school back in 1979, she began working with livestock and farming. Because of Aychurok's hard work, today her farm has two dairy cows. On her 0.60 hectare plot of land, she grows corn for fattening cattle as well as tomatoes and peppers for personal consumption. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Aychurok asked the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan of 20,000 KGS to buy sheep to fatten and resell. She would also like to use part of the funds to buy a stove for her house. Aychurok plans to use profits from the loan to help improve her finances and living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1635189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkyshtak village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-02T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-01T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aychurok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1435},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1458},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1544},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1589},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1683},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1732},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1888},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.68},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.86,"local_amount":2893,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-25T08:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3025.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463318},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-29T09:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947332},{"amount":30.88,"local_amount":1544,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1614.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440682},{"amount":31.74,"local_amount":1589,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1661.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.04,"payment_id":561578502},{"amount":32.66,"local_amount":1635,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1710.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.04,"payment_id":579489121},{"amount":32.33,"local_amount":1683,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.33,"payment_id":595436312},{"amount":32.85,"local_amount":1732,"processed_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1811.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.79,"payment_id":610751318},{"amount":33.3,"local_amount":1782,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1863.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.34,"payment_id":624799017},{"amount":33.07,"local_amount":1834,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1918.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.61,"payment_id":636161157},{"amount":74.69,"local_amount":3808,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3982.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.47,"payment_id":649513587}],"funded_date":"2014-07-03T07:58:12Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:39:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":733525,"name":"Lolo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Lolo est  uniquement compos\u00e9  de femmes polygames.

","en":"Aitykan is 51 years old, married, and has three children. Aitykan has a secondary education. As the primary source of income for the family she works in animal husbandry. She started twenty years ago when she bought three sheep. Because of Aitykan's hard work, her farm now has three dairy cows, ten sheep, twelve goats, and two horses. Also on her 1.20 hectare plot of land Aitykan grows feed for livestock. Her monthly income is about 13,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Aitykan asked the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy calves, sheep, and goats to expand her herd. Aitykan plans to use profits from the loan to further expand her livestock, and she plans to save enough money to repair her

Now Anik and her family members are planing to expand their agribusiness. \r\n\r\nFor this reason Anik has applied for a loan of 1,500 USD to buy livestock (2 cows and 100 hens) as well as animal feed. This family is in a very difficult financial situation. Moreover, only three of five family members are engaged in agricultural activities as two of Anik's sons are still very little.

She is a kind, responsive, polite and hardworking wife. Mayram lives in a small town of Tursun-zoda. She has been involved in animal husbandry for about 15 years. Mayram provides food and water and takes care of livestock herself. She fattens up the livestock for a set amount of time and then resells it with a markup. Now Mayram has one cow remaining and decided to expand her business and buy young livestock. Mayram does not have enough money to buy the necessary quantity of livestock, and this is why she requested a loan.

As a result of his commitment and excellent customer service, he has two sales outlets where he has been able to provide jobs.  On special dates, he hires more people in order to cover the customer demand in his shops.  Based on his experience over time, Erney knows that the best way to make progress is to encourage constant product turnover.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan in order to buy merchandise to restock his two shops.

Despite the adversities he has faced he is always moving ahead. Due to a lack of financial resources he only attended school until the third grade.

He lives alone with his father.\r\n\r\nHe works with his father and his work schedule is variable in accordance with the nature of the tides at the moment. Generally, he goes out at 6 in the morning and returns at 6 in the afternoon.

wasn't able to continue because she lacked the financial resources.  She decided to work in rope-making producing hammocks.  She also does housekeeping work.  She's married and her husband works in agriculture.  They have five children; four attend school and the other one is little and not in school.  The three oldest help their father with the farming.\r\n\r\nShe has 22 years of experience in rope-making, which she learned from her parents when she stopped attending school.  She has earned a living in this job ever since.  She does this work in her free time after taking care of her family.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's requesting is to buy three sacks of fertilizer, two bags of corn seed, and three bags of foliar fertilizer, as well as to pay the rent on the land they farm and to pay for labor.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to have an abundant harvest from her corn field so she'll have enough food for the family.  Also, she'll sell what's left over from her harvest to have the income to help her children with their studies, because one of her dreams is for her children to become important people in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1635555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and seed, and to pay the rent on her land and to pay for labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-02T23:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-01T23:20:07Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Asunci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":84.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":90.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":103.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.7,"local_amount":83.7,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009312},{"amount":93.28,"local_amount":93.28,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":93.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420144},{"amount":98.63,"local_amount":98.63,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":98.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145279},{"amount":115.47,"local_amount":115.47,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":115.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832597},{"amount":113.95,"local_amount":113.95,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":113.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536173},{"amount":94.97,"local_amount":94.97,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482333}],"funded_date":"2014-07-23T16:53:09Z","paid_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":730774,"name":"Liderando Las Palmeras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio H\u00e9ctor Gustavo pertenece al banco comunal LIDERANDO LAS PALMERAS, \u00e9l banco est\u00e1 ubicado en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nEl socio H\u00e9ctor Gustavo tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad y es soltero, \u00e9l socio alterna sus actividades diarias con el negocio de crianza de animales menores como cuyes, \u00e9l socio lleva buen tiempo dedic\u00e1ndose a este negocio el cual le va bien gracias  al empe\u00f1o que le pone cada d\u00eda a su negocio, el socio a la vez trabaja en una instituci\u00f3n privada, el socio desea poder seguir trabajando para de esta forma seguir adelante, este pr\u00e9stamo es parte de una de las l\u00edneas de cr\u00e9dito de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa su nombre es Credi Yapa, esta l\u00ednea de cr\u00e9dito es otorgado a los prestatarios con buen historial crediticio, siendo este un grupo que cumple dichas caracter\u00edsticas.\n\nEl socio solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de cuyes para su negocio.\n\nEl socio se siente agradecido por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado y se compromete a cumplir con sus cuotas establecidas.\n\nLos dem\u00e1s socios se dedican a la agricultura, hotel, restaurante, transport\u00e9, turismo.\n\nLa socia que sale adjunta a la foto pidi\u00f3 permiso para llegar tarde a la reuni\u00f3n por motivos de trabajo.\n","en":" H\u00e9ctor Gustavo belongs to the communal bank LIDERANDO LAS PALMERAS, located in the province and department of Cusco.
