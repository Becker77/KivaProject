His major activity is farming, especially coffee. He applied for a loan of UGX 1,500,000. He wants to use the money to mulch his coffee plantation so that he can improve his coffee and banana yields. The challenge has been low productivity in his farming due to poor farming methods, but he believes this will soon be history. His prime target is to yield high output from his plantations. But he is limited by capital and funds to enable him to achieve his dreams. With this loan, he believes his production will improve and his lifestyle will change in society.

They strive to create an uncontested market space for traditional seeds and directly linking them to consumers through public awareness, media and social networking.

He has his hand raised in the photo. He is a married man, 45 years old, with six children, four of whom attend school. He deals in local brewing and he does farming as a side business. He started his brewing business in 1996 in order to improve his standard of living and to pay school fees for his children.

The Community Press is dedicated to encourage community service among citizens and employees, recognizing that the more they are involved with the community, the better they will be able to understand and serve it.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, The Community Press publishes 5,000 copies bi-weekly and is distributed throughout the Delta Area, and is free to readers. The publication earns $2,000 to $4,000 in advertising sales per month. To grow and improve the product, Rina Diane needs to lease office space and hire two part-time employees to help bring in more revenue. She turned to Accion Texas this spring for a $5,000 loan.

His major activity is farming especially coffee farming. He applied for a loan of UGX 1,500,000. He wants to use the money to mulch his coffee and banana plantation such that he can improve his output in the next season.

He is 46 years old and has two children who are currently in school. He oversees the operation of their Jeepney unit, and his income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nHe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which he is paid *boundary (daily quota) each day. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 every day. \r\n\r\nCuriously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Philippine.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\nSilvestre is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan assistance to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of his Jeepney unit. He will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes that his business will be continuously operating and growing. He dreams that his children will finish their studies and that they shall have sufficiency in everything.\r\n\r\nHe meets up with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his life and business every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1636994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for spare parts and maintenance of his jeepney unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-03T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-02T12:10:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Slivestre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.69,"local_amount":4666.69,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5107.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517189},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2918.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000149},{"amount":66.64,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2918.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491672}],"funded_date":"2014-07-03T13:38:31Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":731676,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is married and blessed with five children aged between 13 years and 9 years.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nFelina dreams that her business will continue to expand and hopes that her family will always stick together even if life is hard. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1630926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The majority of them wear the typical guipiles (woven blouses) and cortes (woven skirts). In Nahuala, the blouses are known for beautiful patterns and colors. Because of this, all but one member has created a business in the making and selling of these clothes. The women will use the money from their loans to buy traditional back strap looms and threads, and then begin to weave these incredible clothes. \r\n\r\nPascuala, who is 63 years old, is the only member of the group who does not specialize in traditional clothes. The owner of a small but successful bakery and bread shop in Nahuala, she will use her loan portion to buy flour and other ingredients to keep her business thriving. \r\n\r\nHaving grown up together in Nahuala, the nine women of the group have been friends for a long time.

The town has a balance of traditional and modern. It is here that the 11 women in the Florecitas Trust Bank meet to receive a loan from Friendship Bridge. For some, it will be their very first loan, and for others, it will be another loan cycle. For the most part, they are dressed in traditional dress and speak exclusively in Kiche. \r\n\r\nThe women in the Florecitas Trust Bank group are motivated. They chose the name Florecitas, meaning little flowers, because they believe with the support of Friendship Bridge and Kiva investors, they will be able to grow their businesses and personal lives into something beautiful.\r\n\r\nLucia, the president of the trust bank, is an example of this. She only had the chance to go to school through third grade, but all four of her children graduated from high school. She has created three businesses, but she is currently focusing on her business buying and reselling huipiles and cortes (traditional outfits). She will use the loan to increase her inventory and selection of huipils and cortes. She also wants to buy thread and materials to make more products. \r\n\r\nThe women are rooted in their traditions, but they are progressive in their thoughts and actions. All of the women believe in themselves as women, their power as individuals, and as businesswomen. They work as hard as they do in part to provide for their families and to make sure their daughters and sons have more opportunities than they did.

community for almost a year now. She is 58 years of age and blessed with three children. Her husband, Oscar, works as an electrician and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales everyday.\r\n\r\nGina plans to cook and sell burgers and more snack recipes, but she doesn't have enough capital. For this reason, she would like to request a loan amount of 12,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional raw products like pork and chicken and seasonings that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nGina dreams to build and expand her business to secure the future of her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1637840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for raw ingredients like bread, burgers, pork, chicken, vegetables and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-03T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-02T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.03,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4815.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517191},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3210.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000151},{"amount":91.65,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4013.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491674}],"funded_date":"2014-07-03T20:18:50Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":732021,"name":"Asuisui","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asuisui is a 69-year-old widowed woman with nine children.

She is 56 years of age and blessed with two children. Her husband, Apolonio, helps her with their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Carmelita wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to request a loan amounting to 50,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nCarmelita aspires to save enough money so she can afford to send her children to college. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is 51-years-old and currently resides with her husband, Norberto, in Manila, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than two years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Milagros would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 12,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Milagros hopes to succeed in all that she is pursuing and dreams of a better life for her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1637882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-03T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-02T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":128.36,"local_amount":5600,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5618.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517192},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3210.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000152},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3210.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491675}],"funded_date":"2014-07-03T21:29:39Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":732033,"name":"Fiaoo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fiaoo is a 42-year-old, single woman with five children.

Sherif\u2019s proudest achievement is working with nonprofits to raise money critical to programs that help homeless individuals get off the streets and into jobs. \n\nHowever, Sherif has found it difficult to scale his business. Rent is high and equipment is expensive. With this loan, he will be able to purchase more equipment to increase productivity. \n\n\u201cProfessionally, this business has the potential to help over 100 million sports players raise money for their organizations to help those organizations grow in the community to provide more critical services to people in need of a positive outlet,\u201d explains Sherif. \n\nHelp Sherif build his business and encourage youth and adults to lead a healthy and active lifestyle!

When Dana found herself laid off a few years back, she seized the opportunity to change directions in her career. \n\nWhile flipping through a community college catalog, Dana stumbled upon classes to become a supervised monitor for families that have been separated due to various reasons.  She decided to take the plunge and after completing her certification, she started her own visitations and transfers business. Part of Dana\u2019s services include observing and documenting visits between non-custodial parents and their children, helping families stick together even through difficult circumstances. Dana loves supporting these families, and has already helped five families since starting her business six months ago.\n\nThe main challenge that Dana has faced in getting her business off the ground is getting her name out there. Most of her business comes through word of mouth and existing relationships, so it has been difficult for her to have consistent work. However, Dana is confident that once enough lawyers and families know about her exceptional services, she will be able to build a stable client base.\n\nThis Kiva loan will help Dana to purchase a new computer and perform much needed car maintenance to keep it safe for transporting the families she works with. Dana is also working on a flier to market her business and hopes some additional marketing will increase her exposure. \n\nTo support her start-up, Dana is also currently teaching at a preschool but hopes to eventually be able to grow her business to the point where she could do it full-time.

As a way of generating income, he has been engaged in a variety store business within his community in Manila, Philippines for eight years now. Together with his wife, he works hard to provide for the everyday needs of their family.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Camilo earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Camilo wants to make his business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, he would like to access a loan amounting to 20,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed.

","en":"Rahila is one of those women, who are involved in animal husbandry. She has been breeding cows and sheep, milking cows and selling milk for thirty years. She uses the business income to buy products, spend for her children by buying necessary things and paying for education. Rahila has seven children. All of them are already grown and help their mother with the household and business. The sons take cattle to a pasture, and daughter helps milk the cows. Rahila's husband is involved in dekhan farming. He has a land plot, where he grows cereal crops and vegetables.\r\n\r\nRahila's family decided to buy a cow and livestock feed. At the present time, Rahila does not have the necessary amount of money in hand because she has not yet sold cows and spends the income from selling milk on ongoing expenses. Rahila came to MDO Arvand to obtain a loan. She very much hopes to receive the requested sum and be able to realize her plans. She is grateful in advance for the help and

because there is a need and he has decided to pursue it and later create a fleet of boats. \r\nFor these reasons, Franklin is requesting a loan to buy wood for his new business.

","en":"Muminjon is a promising young man. He has his own business. He has a women's shoe store at the \"Badri Munir\" central market. Ten years ago, when he first started his business, distributors brought merchandise to him, and now he brings shoes himself from Bishkek and sells them. He started with very little and a small selection of shoes. Gradually and spending earned money wisely, he was able to expand his selection and create his own client base. His family supports him in this business. He has a loving wife and, despite his young age, two beautiful children. The young father tries to ensure that his family and children were not in need for anything. He has a higher education, but due to market difficulties, decided not to wait for a suitable job and started his own business. Now with things going well, he needs money for goods turnover, and he decided to obtain the necessary remaining amount as a loan to purchase a new selection of women's shoes. He came to MDO Arvand to fulfill this goal. He thanks everyone in advance for help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1635921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

Wheel-chair bound people need access to vans like the EMT vehicles he drove, not just during medical emergencies, but to get to doctor\u2019s appointments, to accomplish tasks and to get to events.\r\n\r\nSo after saving money and buying a van equipped with a wheelchair lift, Reginald started operating his business, Quality Performance Transportation, this February. Reginald said what sets his company apart from other transportation companies serving wheelchair bound individuals is personalized service.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe conform to the needs of the individual,\u201d Reginald said. \u201cWe might have a patient that needs more assistance, say the patient is at the doctor\u2019s office, we take notes and provide the notes to the caretaker. We have another client, and all that this particular client needs is for us to be precisely on time so he\u2019s not waiting. We do what the patient needs to have done.\u201d\r\n\r\nReginald received a small business loan from Accion Texas for marketing and working capital. With some of the money, Reginald invested in creating a direct-mail flyer that he started sending out to potential clients this June. \r\n\r\nHe said within two weeks of sending out the flyers, his business is already on track to triple the net revenue. Before the direct-mail campaign started, the company was pulling in $700 to $900 a month. Within two weeks of mailing out the flyer, he said the company generated $1,200 of business.\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to breathe a little and it\u2019s nice,\u201d he said.\r\n \r\nReginald said he is plan is to continue sending out direct mail flyers to clients, and then buy another van in six months, and perhaps approach Accion Texas with another loan to expand his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2603.43,"image":{"id":1637618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

American persistence and grit. Mike grew up with his mother on a farm with dreams of making a living working the land. That all changed when his mother died, sending him to the city to live with his father, far away from the agricultural community that was all he knew.\r\n\r\nAt 18, Mike joined the Marines, which is where he first started driving trucks. After being discharged, he went to work as a truck driver for a domestic freight company, which is where he stayed for the next 14 years until the business shut down. Mike saw this as an opportunity rather than a setback, buying up his former employer\u2019s old equipment and using his connections from years of working in the trucking industry as a cross-country deliverer to provide a ready client base. \r\n\r\nSharon, Mike\u2019s wife of 29 years, joined him in running the business. She eventually learned to drive a rig, too, accompanying Mike on long hauls until they started fostering kids.\r\n\r\nRunning a business is not all roses and sunshine, as Mike and Sharon will tell you. After overcoming skyrocketing fuel prices, cumbersome State regulations, a sour economy and exploding engines, Mike and Sharon were forced to lose their home in order to keep their business, following bankruptcy proceedings caused by a large client\u2019s default.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Mike and Sharon persevered, and now their business is on a firmer footing than ever due to the growth of a loyal client, Stone Brewing. They will use their Kiva loan to buy a trailer to allow them to meet the demands for their services. With this last bit of investment, Double Time Express is poised to become a sustainable business that Mike and Sharon can pass on to their kids.\r\n\t"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3783.21,"image":{"id":1637758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

He had a hard time finding a new job in the midst of the recession, with employers saying that he was overqualified for the positions they had available. After six months, he landed a bartender job, which was the catalyst that sparked him to start his own business.\r\n\r\nGetting back into the food service industry as a bartender inspired Rene to consider starting his own business.  His first job was as a cashier at Jack in the Box when he was 17, and through the years, he has held many jobs dealing with food preparation and foodservice management.  He decided to take these 22 years of experience and open Tortifruit, a deli specializing in Mexican style sandwiches and fruit salads. \r\n\r\nRene and his wife Escamilla run the shop, using only top quality ingredients to set Tortifruit apart from the competition.  Rather than ordering large quantities of wholesale bread and produce, they buy small quantities daily so that they only serve the freshest ingredients.  Rene loves working in foodservice, because it is always a challenge. No two days are ever alike. He also loves the way food makes people feel comfortable and at home. \r\n\r\nBusiness is growing steadily for Rene and Escamilla and they have reached a point where they need additional equipment to keep up with demand. They will use their Kiva loan to purchase another blender, as well as a refrigerated sandwich prep table.\r\n\r\nTortifruit has already been embraced by the local community, and Rene hopes these improvements will help his shop become the number one Chamango\/Torta in the region.  Ultimately, what Rene and Escamilla seek is their own slice of the American Dream, believing that their dedication (15 hour days) to their business will eventually provide them with more independence and time to spend with their kids.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2838.97,"image":{"id":1637776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She began researching living a more healthy, holistic lifestyle and learned about how beauty products can affect one\u2019s health.  \r\n\r\nShe combined her love for cooking with some online research and began cooking her own personal care products, starting with hair products and eventually moving into creating body creams and soaps.  Her family and friends eventually caught wind of her newfound hobby and began asking if she would sell them some of her all-natural creations. Tangireen Naturals was born.\r\n\r\nTangie launched her business with a mission to make all natural personal care products affordable to the masses, challenging the common perception that all-natural means more expensive.  She has seen how her line of natural skin products cures various skin ailments, such as acne, as well as improves the quality of life of patients with more serious ailments.\r\n\r\nThis entrepreneur is now ready to bring her business to the next level and share her line of products with the masses.  She will use her $5,000 Kiva loan to purchase more ingredients to make her skin products and to market her budding business.\r\n\r\nWith four children, Tangie ultimately hopes that her business will be able to build a legacy for her family, and that they will continue the business that she has

With this purchase, he will benefit with his family, since at night they will have their own light. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1636335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase a solar lamp.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-07-03T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-02T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":9.28,"local_amount":9.28,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-23T09:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":519530288},{"amount":9.16,"local_amount":9.16,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T09:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":9.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530495091},{"amount":9.28,"local_amount":9.28,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-19T09:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":9.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":543043682},{"amount":9.39,"local_amount":9.39,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562332240},{"amount":9.41,"local_amount":9.41,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":9.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579477565},{"amount":9.53,"local_amount":9.53,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":9.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595083804},{"amount":1.01,"local_amount":1.01,"processed_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611989583},{"amount":18.3,"local_amount":18.3,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-26T09:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":18.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626295136},{"amount":9.78,"local_amount":9.78,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636145818},{"amount":14.86,"local_amount":14.86,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":14.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649500861}],"funded_date":"2014-07-04T00:41:58Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:21:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":732155,"name":"Marissa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marissa is 31 years old and married with three children.

She is also able to sell at least 4 breakfast menus which she sells from 1:00 to 10:00 a.m. every day. With the improvement in the business space, Razelle's stall started attracting more customers. Staff from a nearby hospital, as well as patient's watchers began patronizing her business.\n\nOn her 2nd loan now to SEED, Razelle plans to repair and buy furnishings such as tables, chairs, plates and other dining supplies to cater to the growing number of her customers.

She is 35 years old, married, and she is a fruits and vegetables vendor who sells her produce out of her home. She has done this for the past three years, ever since she took out a loan from her sister for the purchase of seasonal fruits in small quantities. Since that time, she has invested her profits to grow her business and this has motivated her to request a loan from this microfinance institution for the purchase of tomatoes, pear squash, tapioca root, and green plantains with the goal of expanding her inventory. \r\n\r\nThe other group members include Se\u00f1ora Narcisa, 49 years old, who has made her living selling nacatamales in her home and buying and traveling to the capital to buy and sell goods for special orders for the past 25 years. The other member is Se\u00f1or Mercedes, 28 years old, who runs a small grocery store in his home. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1636424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2014-07-04T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-03T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Narcisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":232.95,"local_amount":6011.57,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T08:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6060.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517441183},{"amount":155.24,"local_amount":4006.1,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4038.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529925143},{"amount":155.21,"local_amount":4005.34,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4037.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542417623},{"amount":231.6,"local_amount":5976.99,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6025.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561555447}],"funded_date":"2014-07-20T19:09:31Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T10:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Loria","image":1592937}},{"id":732184,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to pay for her son's education.
