Her life partner works in agriculture.  Her three children go to school and live with her.  So, there are four people who are dependent upon her.\r\n\r\nSilvia has been selling tortillas for ten years.  She learned to do this because of her family\u2019s financial needs.  She also sells fresh cheese at her house.  This generates an additional income.  She gets up very early and travels 600 meters from her house to the stand where she sells tortillas.  Her daughter helps her grind grains into flour.\r\n\r\nThe money from the loan will be used for her life partner to grow corn.  They now have the land ready to work, but have not done so because of financial reasons.\r\n\r\nSilvia's dreams are to have a strong store at her house so that she does not have to leave to sell and to give her children an education so that they become good people.  She knows that with God\u2019s help and with the help of the loans, she will manage to achieve these things.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1636427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She studied up to the fifth grade. Due to financial reasons she was unable to continue studying and had to make a living working. She is married and her husband is an employee at a business.

She learned this as the result of the unemployment that exists in the country. She also had to help her husband get their children ahead.

Afterward she has to go back to household chores. <br \/><br \/>The money from this loan will be invested in the purchase of corn.

Therefore, he decided to spend his time working so that he could help with the household expenses; and also have his own personal income.  \r\n\r\nHe is married and his wife dedicates her time to looking after the house.  He has a son who is five and goes to primary school.  The three of them live together in his house.\r\n\r\nHe works in agriculture; planting vegetables, tomatoes, cabbage, cucumbers, squash, and many more.  He has been doing this for 15 years.  His plantations are located one kilometer away from his house.  He doesn't have any fixed working hours because he has to look after the crops whenever necessary.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy supplies for his plantations.  He will also build a small tunnel which will protect his vegetables from plagues.  As a result, he will have better production and improve his profits.\r\n\r\nOscar hopes to expand his crops in the future.  He'd also like to build more small tunnels to protect his harvest.  Apart from this, he'd like to study a university degree and perform better in what he does in his life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1636457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies and to build a small tunnel to protect his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-04T06:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-03T06:00:36Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Arnulfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696541625}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T17:25:32Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:17:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":732238,"name":"Saturnina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A $600 loan is offered to Saturnina to improve her business.

So she is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to buy shingles, wallpaper and hardwood floors in order to repair the damaged parts. After the repairs, she will live in comfort.

He will also make some repairs to his place of business, so as to have a higher quality business image and increase potential sales."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1636478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy phone credits, as demand has increased, and to make repairs to his place of business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-07-04T09:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-03T09:00:03Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":163655},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":181065},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":186497},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":192092},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":197854},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":203790},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":209904},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":216201},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":222687},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":229367},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":236248},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":260640}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Meravi","image":1279777}},{"id":732283,"name":"Mary Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Ann is 31 years old and is married with three children, who are all in school.

This is their ninth loan with Soro Yiriwaso, with whom their previous loans were paid back in full. The group's main produce is rice. The group's representative is Karia, the woman standing second from the left in the back row in the photo. With this loan, she is planning on purchasing farming inputs, seeds and agricultural materials, as well as paying for the labour costs to maintain one hectare of land. After the harvest, the produce will be sold on a village level as well as at market to a customer base made up of both men and woman. She is planning on making an average profit of 90,000 FCFA by the end of the season. These profits will allow her to pay off the loan.

When she was a child, her parents got divorced and lived separately from each other. Her father had another three wives and nineteen children in total. Together with her mother, he has seven children.\r\n\r\nAngellah lived with her mother and her six brothers and sisters, while her father paid the school fees. But her elder sister got pregnant when she was in her first year of secondary. Thus, their father decided that he would not pay school fees for girls any longer. \r\n\r\nFortunately, one of Angellah's brothers already worked; he had a shop. He decided to take care of Angellah and paid her school fees so that she continued going to school. When Angellah was in her third year of secondary, Angellah's brother got robbed, so he lost everything and had no more money to pay for Angellah's school fees. Angellah had to leave school when she was 16 and then decided that the best solution would be to marry.\r\n\r\nNow, Angellah is working as a storekeeper, while her husband is a butcher. She is a mother of five kids between the ages of 19 and 30. The youngest two, aged 19 and 21, still live at home and still go to school. As Angellah did not have the chance to study, her priority is to ensure that her kids have the possibility to study.\r\n \r\nIn order to pay for the school fees, Angellah is also working as a micro-entrepreneur, selling energy-efficient cooking stoves that also generate electricity while cooking. In Uganda, most people do not have access to electricity and use three-stone fires for cooking, which are extremely unhealthy and cause deforestation, as they are inefficient and thus a lot of firewood is needed. Most people in Uganda are very poor and earn little money on a daily\/weekly basis; they do not have savings. \r\n\r\nAngellah's customers, mainly women from her area, cannot afford the clean-cooking stove she is selling, and also Angellah cannot pay UpEnergy to purchase the energy-efficient cooking stoves. The Kiva loan enables Angellah to purchase the stoves and to offer them to her community with installment payments. Thus, these women are able to purchase the energy-efficient cooking stove and benefit from it, while they pay for it in three monthly installments. \r\n\r\nThe benefit of working with UpEnergy for Angellah is that she can support her family (pay for school fees) and help the women in her community (by enabling them to own a clean, energy-efficient cooking stove). But her favorite part of working for UpEnergy remains the ability to pay her children's school fees.\r\n\r\nFor Angellah, the biggest benefit of the energy-efficient stoves is that by using these stoves, people save a lot of money on firewood, as they need less fuel; also, people use firewood instead of more expensive (and more harmful) charcoal. Furthermore, there is almost no smoke at all when using the energy-efficient cooking stove. The other huge benefit is that people can use a light with the stove and even charge their phones. Light enables, for example, studying after dark. \r\n\r\nBy selling UpEnergy's products, Angellah observed that the people in her community have fewer expenses (by saving 50% and more on fuel costs) and that the children cough much less then before (as there is almost no more smoke due to cooking). \r\n\r\nAngellah's hopes and dreams for the future are that she will be a healthy woman and that the poor women in her community will be able to leave poverty and will be able to pay school fees for their kids. \r\n\r\nAnother dream is that one day she will sleep in a good house with walls made from cement, and with electricity. Step by step she is renovating her house by rebuilding the walls, which were originally made of mud and sticks, using bricks, and one day hopefully, even concrete.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1636887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"to pay for clean energy-efficient cooking stoves.

ella hace 5 a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 un emprendimiento propio y dej\u00f3 la agricultura de lado.\nLuc\u00eda se encarga de atender una tienda de barrio, para realizar esa labor se levanta muy temprano por la madrugada y viaja en bote hasta el puerto, continua viajando en bus hasta la comunidad de batallas donde se encuentra su negocio, una vez en el lugar espera que llegue el pan diario porque es el primer alimento en ser solicitado por sus clientes. Abre las puertas y saca los toldos (sombrillas) para que los rayos solares no afecten los alimentos porque el sol llega de una manera muy fuerte al lugar, seguidamente llena un balde con agua y lo esparce en las afueras para que elimine el polvo, m\u00e1s tarde se prepara una taza de sultana caliente (c\u00e1scara de caf\u00e9 hervido) y lo bebe para entrar en calor porque la temperatura ambiente es muy baja (4\u00b0C) a esa hora.\nPara abastecer su tienda Luc\u00eda debe hacer otro viaje a la ciudad de \u2018El Alto\u2019 d\u00f3nde consigue casi toda su mercader\u00eda a ser vendida, eso lo realiza los d\u00edas domingos cuando sus hijos no estudian y se hacen cargo de la tienda, su marido no puede ayudarle porque se ocupa de la pesca diaria.\nLuc\u00eda sue\u00f1a con mejorar sus ingresos para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia, ella no cuenta con capital econ\u00f3mico para la compra de mercader\u00eda y tener su tienda bien abastecida.\nEs por esos motivos que Luc\u00eda solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de refrescos para abastecer su tienda.\n","en":"Luc\u00eda is a 41-year-old woman, married, and mother to three children.\r\n\r\nHer home is found on Suriqui Island; along with her husband, they put forth the effort so that their three children can go to school.  Her husband is a fisherman who has done this work for decades, while 5 years ago she began her own business venture and stopped working in agriculture.\r\n\r\nLuc\u00eda is responsible for a neighborhood store. To do this work, she gets up very early in the morning and goes by boat to the port, she continues travelling by bus to the the community of Batallas where her business is located. Once there, she waits until the daily bread arrives because it is the first food requested by her customers.  She opens the doors and gets out the awnings so the sun's rays don't affect the food because the sun is very strong in that place. Then she fills a bucket with water and sprinkles it outside to get rid of the dust. Later she prepares a hot cup of \"sultana\" (boiled coffee skins) and she drinks it to warm up because the ambient temperature is very low (4\u00b0C) at this time of day.\r\n\r\nTo stock her store, Luc\u00eda needs to go on another journey to the city of El Alto where she gets almost all of the merchandise to be sold. She does this on Sundays when her children aren't in school and they take care of the store. Her husband can't help her because he takes care of the daily fishing.\r\n\r\nLuc\u00eda dreams of increasing her income to improve the quality of life for herself and her family. She doesn't have the economic capital to purchase the merchandise and keep the store well-stocked. For these reasons, Luc\u00eda asks for a loan to purchase soft drinks to stock her store.

Her husband works in agriculture and they are parents of two children, one boy who died only 8 months after being born and a daughter who studied up to the 7th grade. She lives with them and her two children since she is a single mother. They are a very close family in which all work with the goal of getting ahead with all the household expenses and providing school to the children in the house. \r\n\r\nShe has to get up very early to do all the household chores to later work in her tailoring business, which she learned when she was 13. She helped a neighbor to repair clothing until she learned it perfectly and today she works making uniforms for the community school. In this, her daughter helps her finish all the orders for the day that is stipulated in the contract. The work is in her home, so she doesn't have to go anywhere to do it, and the schedule is also varied. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting is to purchase corn and bean seeds, manure, fertilizer absorbed through the leaves, pesticides, and herbicides for the crops that her husband grows.

His wife does the household chores and also grinds in a mill. They are the parents of 5 children, of which only one lives with them. \r\n\r\nCarlos is a farmer who started this work when he was 10 years old. His father taught him this work, as he was a young man who liked to go around with his dad. That\u00b4s how he learned how to do the job. Today, Carlos is grateful to his dad for having taught him this work. The land where he works is 15 minutes away and he gets there in a car that took a lot of effort to buy. It also allows him to transport a corn de-kernelling machine. During the period when they harvest, they hire him to de-kernel the harvest. One of his sons that lives in his own home helps him with this work so he can harvest the crops for all of the residents of the region. \r\n\r\nHe will need the requested loan to buy 6 bags of fertilizer, as it\u00b4s time to put the second round of fertilizer on the corn. This is when the fertilizer works to make the harvest more abundant, and will help a lot.

She is a very young married woman of 26 years.  Her family consists of her husband and their two sons. One of their sons reads in grade seven, and the other works and stays in a different place. Saraswati is illiterate and can only sign her name. Her husband studied until grade seven and could not go for higher study because of his family's poor economic resources.  After her marriage to Mohan, Saraswati is now a housewife.\r\n\r\nSaraswati\u2019s husband is engaged in paddy cultivation.  He grows paddy on his own farmland. The income from the business is not sufficient to meet the family's expenditures and with the daunting responsibilities, he is finding it difficult to run the household. He wants to take on additional paddy cultivation to have sustainable income and to give their son a good education.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of helping her husband with the cultivation, Saraswati is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BJS.

kilometers from \r\nKampala City Centre. His main source of income is from rental units. \r\n\r\nHe is a repeat client, who has taken over eleven cycles of loan facilities. These have helped to sustain him in the changing business of rentals. However, he has a challenge of some tenants' not paying on time.

Meet Janet, a 38-year-old smallholder farmer from Kenya. She is a wife and a mother of two lovely school-going children. Janet, born 3rd in a family of 8, has described her upbringing as challenging. For this reason, she is doing everything in her power to provide her children with a better foundation. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like Janet to turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan \/ asset financing.\r\n\r\nJanet owns 0.8 acres of land in Kaptumo, near the town called Nandi Hills. On the farm, she keeps five dairy cows and 132 chickens. She also grows tomatoes for both family consumption and to sell in the market. Many trees are planted around her home along with flowers and various works of art. It is obvious that Janet is very passionate about the health of the environment and the beauty of her surroundings.\r\n\r\nJanet has been farming for the last five years. She has made great strides and started an agro-shop that gives farmers in the village access to necessary farm supplies.  She has employed three people to help run her small business.  \r\n\r\nShe is very active member of a small group of fellow smallholder farmers who empower each other to become better entrepreneurs. She is also up to speed with the latest technology: She accesses the internet regularly and she uses MPESA services to transfer money through mobile phones.\r\n\r\nHowever, Janet still faces a number of challenges. Many women in Kenya are responsible not only for producing food but also feeding their families. For women like Janet, having access to financial resources through Juhudi and Kiva will increase their productivity and improve their future.\r\n\r\nJanet is seeking a loan to construct a dairy unit, to purchase more stock for her agro-shop, and to grow tomatoes. The financial benefits she will reap from the loan are almost immediate. Janet has successfully cleared Juhudi Kilimo loans in the past on time. From her loan appraisal, Janet is disciplined with money - She updates her budget on a monthly basis, tracks every income and expense and approaches new business opportunities with caution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1639008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To
