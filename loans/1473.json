She will tell you that baking channels the baker\u2019s emotions into the pastry, so Hortenssia (center) makes a point of training all of her employees (pictured to her left and her right) to experience and exhibit joy when they are serving or baking at Love Cupcake Caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can taste the difference,\u201d she explains.\r\n\r\nIn starting Love Cupcake Caf\u00e9, Hortenssia drew on a love of cooking and baking that started when she was a child selling cookies and tamales on the side of the road in her hometown of Tijuana. After working in law enforcement and HR, the economic downturn found Hortenssia out of work and bored. \r\n\r\nShe started baking merely to pass the time, with her husband Juan eventually bringing her cupcakes to his work, which greatly increased Juan\u2019s popularity around the office. This experience led Hortenssia to turn her hobby into an online business. She also enrolled in a pastry decorating school to broaden her skill set.\r\n\r\nOne day, her uncle suggested that she open her own storefront bakery. When she explained that she had tried and failed to find financing for such an endeavor, her uncle offered to lend her money as seed capital. With the money from her uncle, Hortenssia quickly found herself behind the counter of her own bakery caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\nNow that Love Cupcake Caf\u00e9 has been operating for some time, Hortenssia has decided to supplement her considerable cupcake sales with some new sandwich offerings, hoping to appeal to the working lunch crowd while diversifying her revenue stream. She will use her Kiva loan to purchase several pieces of equipment to produce hot sandwiches and paninis.\r\n\r\nDown the road, Hortenssia hopes to open additional locations, but for now, she is content seeing happy faces leaving her store in Chula Vista, the community that nurtured and supported her dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1639405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

He studied through fourth grade; due to his parents' economic situation, he wasn't able to continue studying. He's married and  his wife takes care of the home and cares for their children. He is the father of 4 children. The oldest one is in seventh grade, the second is in seventh grade, the third is in fifth grade, and the last one isn't in school yet becuase of his young age. Only his four children and his wife live with him.\r\n\r\nBaleriano works in agriculture. Specifically, he plants corn and beans. He also mills wood. He has been working in agriculture for 20 years and has been milling wood for 10 years. His parents taught him agriculture. Since he didn't have another source of income, he decided to work in that. He learned to cut wood because he started out working as a helper; once he learned the job, he decided to do it for himself because it was a business that generates income. The place where he works is 2 minutes from his house and he can easily walk there. His oldest son helps him with his work when he returns from school.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy two 100-pound sacks of fertilizer, and four 100-pound sacks of sulfate and herbicides to kill weeds. The loan will help him to have better production, improving his income so his family will have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nBaleriano's dream is to stucco his house, because each time it rains his walls deteriorate more. The goal is to provide improved safety for his children; at the moment they are at risk of being bitten by a kind of insect that hides in the walls."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1637274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy two 100-pound sacks of fertilizer, and four 100-pound sacks of sulfate and herbicides to kill weeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-05T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-04T20:40:08Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baleriano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536181}],"funded_date":"2014-08-04T05:52:07Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:18:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":732896,"name":"Melsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melsa previously accessed a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase merchandise items and products needed in her business.

She finished high school. She wanted to attend the university, but it was too dificult because of her economic situation. She is married. Her husband works in a telephone store with the company Claro. She is the mother of a daughter; her own mother cares for her while she is working. The little girl isn't in school yet because of her young age. Yessenia lives with her siblings, her parents, and her husband.\r\n\r\nYessenia works as a maid in a hotel in the city. She has been doing this for 2 years. She explains that when she finished high school, she went to the city to look for a job. Luckily she found one. When they called her and told her to come, they gave her the instructions about how to do the job. This is how she learned, and she decided to keep working there because it's not so easy to find a job to cover the household expenses. Before this, she only helped her family with the housework. The place where she works is 55 kilometers from her house and she travels by bus every 15 days. The work schedule is from 6:00 in the morning until 9:00 at night.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy seed, fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides and to pay for labor to help her father plant his crops. She will also invest a part of the loan in food for her household and to pay a debt her father has. The loan will help them to eat better and it will help her father be more at ease by not having to think about the debt he has.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to help out her parents with what little she can because they are getting old and need her economic help in order to survive. She also wants to fix part of the roof in her house because it leaks when it rains hard. She also hopes to fix a door in her house so it will be safer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1637286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seed, fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides and to pay for labor to help her father plant his crops.

He has worked in many different areas during his life including art and tailoring. He recently managed to buy a sewing machine, which helped him start his business making sports tracksuits for children. He buys the fabric, designs the patterns and once the tracksuits are finished, he offers them for sale to businesses. The design and sewing are straightforward, but selling the tracksuits to businesses can be difficult, as there are people who don't want to know or who even steal from him. Mario works with his eldest son, aged 17, who helps him sew and in that way earns some money to pay for his schooling. Mario needs to grow his business in the short term and dreams of one day having his own store, where he can offer all of his items for sale. He also wants a better future for his children and this could be the start of it. Mario wants to buy an overlocking machine to increase his output, For this reason, he is requesting a loan to buy the overlocking machine to increase his production and his merchandise.

She works as a domestic employee, doing laundry and ironing in different places. She says that since she was young she has been an enterprising woman, and as her parents did not have a source of income, she decided to leave home to find a way to help her family financially. She learned how to be a domestic employee by herself, and little by little she got used to this kind of life and decided to continue because it has helped her a lot and she has been able to help many families. Before that, she just took care of her home and didn\u00b4t think she could find a way to earn money. The place where she works is two hours away and she gets there by bus. She works from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. She is requesting the loan from CREDICAMPO to buy a refrigerator and also to buy some bed linen. The loan will improve her quality of life and that of her family because if she has a refrigerator, she will be able to store more food and make better meals. Right now she cannot buy many food items because they spoil, but everything will be different if she gets the loan. Concepci\u00f3n\u00b4s dream is to buy furniture, such as beds and bed linen, so that her parents can have a better life.

accessories for her jeepney, as well as to pay for its maintenance. The increase in her earnings were a big help in terms of paying for the education of her children as well as in other areas of the family's personal, household, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. Jeeps were used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sufficiently sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, jeepneys are a phenomenon entirely unique to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n \r\nEva would like to apply for another PhP 15,000 loan so she can buy spare parts for the jeepney as well as to perform necessary maintenance. The increased profits from her business will significantly help her to sustain her family's daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEva dreams of eventually owning a second jeepney. Her goal is to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, as well as to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1639762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married, his wife does the house work. He is the father of two children. The oldest is 16 and is in first year of Secondary school. The second is 15 and is studying in Grade 9. <br \/><br \/>Ricardo works growing basic grains but he is also taking care of cattle for a friend.  His activities are to milk, feed the cows on time, separate the calves and clean the fields. Agriculture is his inheritance which his parents taught him when he was young. He has no other source of income and needs to feed his family. His landlord taught him that he could do this work himself. Where he grows his crops is 5 minutes away and he walks. The cattle are 20 minutes away so he has to walk more. His oldest son helps him when he is not studying. He works from 6 am until 1pm. <br \/><br \/>The loan that he is requesting from CrediCampo is to buy herbicides, insecticides and fertilizer and also pay for labor to help him carry out his tasks. He believes that the loan is of great assistance as it is not easy to get a loan in these times. Ricardo's dream is to have his children study to become professionals. That would allow them to have a different lifestyle in the future. He also indicates that he would like to buy his own animals and care for them as needed so that he wouldn't have to buy dairy products, but rather sell them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1637282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers and to pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-06T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-05T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.42,"local_amount":72.42,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":72.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009692},{"amount":40.48,"local_amount":40.48,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":40.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501903},{"amount":42.31,"local_amount":42.31,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420949},{"amount":35.31,"local_amount":35.31,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":35.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545820},{"amount":52.33,"local_amount":52.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611770138},{"amount":70.13,"local_amount":70.13,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833939},{"amount":37.02,"local_amount":37.02,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":37.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201985}],"funded_date":"2014-08-01T02:50:50Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:05:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":733006,"name":"Rossielle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rossielle grinds coconuts to earn an income.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits.  Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.<br \/><br \/>Estella dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is also where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

her. They live in a small neighborhood called San Jos\u00e9 de las Juntas, which is part of Santo Domingo de los Colorados, a very warm area and characterized by this area which produces many bananas for export. \r\n\r\nMericia is a model mother, she has worked a lot to get her little ones ahead.  She does whatever decent work she can in order to bring food to the home. At the moment she has a food stall at a school, where she prepares food and sells candies to the children at the school, in addition she does the cleaning in the school and parents of the children have contracted her to prepare school breakfast because it is very good and also to be able to help her with the income, since she is a low-income mother. \r\n\r\nMericia has a small house of her own where she also raises pigs. This is another source of income since the food stall is not enough. She sees the way to get ahead through very hard work, since Mericia separated from her partner several years ago for irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nMericia turned to the institution on the referral of her brother who is an excellent client of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. Mericia, with the loan that she received, will be able to purchase cstandandies and food for the stall and in addition she will purchase some piglets to raise them for sale.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the support that the institution has given her to grow her business.

She will also use the loan for the maintenance of her van and in buying peanut butter ingredients. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her family's daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes that her business will continue to flourish and dreams that her family will always be in good health.

She depends on her mama lishe (a small restaurant or cafe) business to raise income for her family life. Fatuma has ten years experience with her business and is able to make a good profit each month. She works from 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily.\r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, this is her second credit request. With her previous loan, Fatuma replenished her store of food cooking ingredients (especially rice, beans, sugar, maize and baking flour). She has paid back successfully her loan. She had a fridge but it is now broken, so she can't sell cold drinks to her food customers. She plans to use part of this credit to buy a freezer. She will also use part of it to buy food ingredients like rice, maize and baking flour, vegetables, sugar, and other items. Her ambition is to greatly expand her business and make a better life for her family. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group, \"Muheza,\" which consist of four members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

three children who are still minors.  Nazgul has a secondary education and she has been involved in animal husbandry since 1997.  She started in this business with an initial capital of 6,000 som (KGS) and now owns one horse, three cows, four calves and 25 head of sheep.  Nazgul also cultivates crops, growing clover and corn.  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the Bai Tushum and Partners bank and requested a loan of 135,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy some calves and sheep in order to increase her cattle headcount and to make her business more profitable.  Nazgul is planning to use the earnings from her loan to develop her farming business.  She would also like to buy a car and to start building a house for her son.

","en":"Karima is 37 years old, married, and the mother of three daughters.   She sells clothes at the market, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business in 2010 with an initial capital of 50,000 som.  Thanks to Karima's very hard work, her total merchandise's turnover is worth 380,000 som (KGS) and she makes a monthly profit of 19,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to the Bai Tushum and Partners bank and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to increase her turnover through the purchase of more clothes.  Karima is the leader of a group named \"Acylzat\", which gathers four members.  Karima is a respected member of the group.  She is dedicated to her work and has a great experience in her business.  She plans to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further developing her business, so that she can build a house for her family.

She started in this business in 2013 with an initial capital of 30,000 som.  Today, her merchandise's turnover is worth 150,000 som (KGS) and she makes a monthly profit of 16,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Batma has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners bank and requested a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).

She grew up with her parents who worked as merchants every day, since they had a small store in their own house, and also worked in agriculture and animal husbandry.  She completed her basic education up to fourth grade in the local school and couldn't continue her education because her family had very limited economic resources. She had to work doing the household tasks. With the passing of time, she decide to open her own business which began with the sale of basic supplies and now sells natural medicines and made her own home. She is the parent of a daughter and a son who are now adults and work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nJuana works selling basic supplies and natural medicines. She says that she has 15 years of experience in this field, which was taught to her by her parents who spent a long time in this business, and it is what she currently does and she finds she has a lot of willingness for this since the earnings from this business motivate her, apart from not having to go to another workplace since the business is in her house, and in this way she has time to care for her family since they are her most valued possession.\r\n\r\nThe granted loan will be used to invest in expanding and improving her business since the loan will purchase a corn (nixtamal) mill to serve the people in the community and another part will be invested in stocking the business with pantry products and natural medicines.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to strengthen her business in a way that generates sufficient income to hire people to serve the customers and to have a larger retail space which will allow her to sell pupusas on weekday afternoons.  With the benefit that this loan offers, she will use the earnings to invest and stock her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1637480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase a corn (nixtamal) mill and the other part will be invested to stock a business selling pantry supplies and natural medicine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-06T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-05T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":42.86,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":42.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517526952},{"amount":46.44,"local_amount":46.44,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":46.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009342},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":44.74,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":44.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501366},{"amount":48.73,"local_amount":48.73,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":48.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420174},{"amount":102.4,"local_amount":102.4,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":102.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145304},{"amount":51.14,"local_amount":51.14,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768899},{"amount":54.18,"local_amount":54.18,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":54.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832616},{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":56.63,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":56.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536187},{"amount":45.67,"local_amount":45.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":45.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802192},{"amount":107.21,"local_amount":107.21,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":107.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482344}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T18:23:07Z","paid_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":733115,"name":"Al Asdikaa1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amal is the featured representative of the Al Asdikaa1 group.

The most important thing for her is her family.  She grew up with a grandmother who spent her whole life working as a merchant. She was the owner of a store that she served every day because it was in a room of her house. Her grandmother was a very humble and hard-working person and it was she who taught her the work of a merchant.  In this way, putting into practice everything she learned from her grandmother, she has been able to get ahead.  Today, Ana is the mother of a child who is a student in the local school.\r\n\r\nShe works selling pantry products in the community.  She also takes care of the household chores; as a mother and wife, she is concerned with keeping the house as clean as possible. \r\n\r\nThe money will be used to stock her business with basic products such as rice, beans, sugar, salt, cinnamon, coffee, bread, candies, drinks, etc. since she states that the store which was the closest to hers has closed and the demand for products has risen significantly. She will sell these to increase her income and to produce more earnings which will be invested in improving her house.\r\n\r\nHer future plans are to invest as much time as possible so that her her business grows, since it has become her primary source of income and her goals are to expand it more and more in a way that will allow her to create employment for people in her community and support the academic formation of her child until he is a successful professional and does good for the community.

Odisha in the northern part of India. The group is composed of thirteen women who earn their living by raising animals such as cattle and chickens, selling milk, and cultivating and selling vegetables. They need additional capital to maintain, enhance or expand their businesses and decided to apply for a loan with People's Forum. They are excited and full of hope to begin this new harvesting season with solid goals and dreams. \r\n\r\nHiramani is a 45-year-old married mother of one child, aged 19 years. In the picture, the lady seated in the middle and wearing a red-white colour saree is Hiramani. She completed three years of formal education, but due to the poor economic condition of her family, had to leave her education behind. Along with all the clients of People's Forum, Hiramani realizes that education is a vital key to a successful future for her child. She shares that her business is running quite well and, because of its success, she will be able to register her child in a good school this year! Her husband shares the same goals for the child. \r\n\r\nHiramani is engaged in vegetable cultivation, and she produces potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and seasonal vegetables. She is applying for her first loan with People's Forum. The requested funds will be used to purchase standard-quality seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for her vegetable cultivation. \r\n\r\nWith an optimistic spirit and positive attitude, Hiramani looks forward to this new year with its challenges, blessings and successes. On behalf of her colleagues, Hiramani expresses gratitude and appreciation for the support from Kiva investors throughout the world who lend such necessary and vital support.

\n","en":"Gulnoza is a young, energetic woman of 24.  She is divorced and has 1 child, who is still a minor.  Gulnoza is raising and providing for her child by herself.  In order to feed herself and her baby, she started her own business buying and selling women's clothing.  She has been running her business now for one year.
