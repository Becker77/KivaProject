She and her husband try to provide their children with everything that they need.

The relations among group members are marked by solidarity and mutual help. The group members mainly work as vendors.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mariama (the one seated on the far right raising her left hand) is the star borrower of the group. She is married and the mother of three children ranging from ten to 15 years of age: one boy and two girls. She is a very energetic woman selling fritters and fishcakes she cooks at home for resale at the market. She has been in this business over five years and knows her customer base well.\r\nWith this new loan, she plans to buy 25 kg [55 lbs] of flour, a 10-liter [2.6 gal] jug of vegetable oil, sugar and various ingredients needed to cook fritters and fishcakes for resale. Thanks to her revenues, she plans to take an active part in providing for household needs (the children's school fees, clothing and healthcare) and use the rest to grow her savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":1641341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 25 kg [55 lbs] of flour, a 10-liter [2.6 gal] jug of vegetable oil, sugar and various ingredients for cooking fritters and fishcakes for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2014-07-07T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-06T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":206.81,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ansata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamarana Djiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rougui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khadidiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diambang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1950000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3868.19,"local_amount":1950000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1957891.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":206.81,"payment_id":595133417}],"funded_date":"2014-07-26T23:01:11Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:49:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":732001,"name":"Adam","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Adan trabaja en un taller de costura, a la vez est\u00e1 estudiando la carrera de Marketing que cursa el 2 a\u00f1o.\nEs una persona muy responsable y dedicada a sus estudios y a su familia, quiere ser un profesional \u00fatil a la sociedad y a s\u00ed mismo.\nAdan est\u00e1 pidiendo este pr\u00e9stamo para poder pagar las cuotas de su universidad, lo que le serpa de mucha ayuda para poder cumplir su meta.\n","en":"Adan works at a sewing workshop.

He didn't have the economic resources to finish school.  With a lot of sacrifice, he was barely able to finish fourth grade.  He's married and his wife helps him arduously to get their four children ahead.  Their children are currently in school.\r\n\r\nSabino learned agriculture at the age of 13.  His father taught him this work so he could hold his own in life, and it was his source of income.  He's very enterprising and enthusiastic.  He gets up very early to go to the field to work.  Currently he has a cornfield planted and he hopes to have good results.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, sulfate, soil amendments, and other things to strengthen his crop.\r\n\r\nHis dream for the future is to expand his business so he earns more profit and to improve his quality of life and his family's.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1636499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-07T04:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-06T04:00:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":51.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":53.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009345}],"funded_date":"2014-08-01T20:21:07Z","paid_date":"2014-09-17T11:26:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":733380,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hilda, age 44, is from Northern Poblacion, Calamba, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

","en":"Umeda has dreamed of starting her own business and becoming a successful entrepreneur since she was a child.  She is 21 years old, divorced, and is raising one child who has yet to come of age.  After her divorce, Umeda moved back into her parents' home.  She is hoping to start her own business to be able to provide for herself and her child; namely, she plans on selling children's clothing at a local marketplace.  With this goal in mind, she enrolled in a course titled \"Achieve Success\" sponsored by an association for businesswomen and received a certificate upon completion.   Her mother has promised to help her get her business up and running; in addition, Umeda is seeking a loan of 6000 somoni to buy children's clothing for her store.

She has the equivalent of a high school education and has farmed crops and livestock for more than 25 years.  She also sells children's clothing at a bustling marketplace nearby to earn some extra money on the side.  Thanks to her persistence and goal-oriented nature, Arapathon currently has six sheep, as well as a 1.70 hectare plot of land of her own where she grows and harvests cotton each year, and her monthly income is nearly 12,000 som.  To further develop her farm, Arapathon is seeking a loan of 50,000 som from Bai-Tushum & Partners to buy livestock for breeding and eventual resale.  She is intent on expanding her business as it will inevitably bolster her family's finances, and plans on using some of this additional money to help build a home for her son.

His wife takes care of the household and they have three children; so there are four dependents under his care.\r\n\r\nHe currently works with metal structures and has been in business for 25 years, having learned the trade from his father.  He also has time to work in agriculture.

As with all Wezesha Project loans, it must be used only for their businesses. As with most businesses in Bukavu, these women are sellers. They buy products from neighbouring Rwanda, or larger markets in town and resell them in their areas to make a profit. The women of Tumaini sell things like poultry, sugar, charcoal, bread, and other staples. \n\nJudith will use the loan to buy flats of eggs and live chickens for sale. Because this is a consumer market, the ability to buy in larger quantities means a better price, and a better price means more profit. Judith is married but her husband is unemployed. This leaves her to be the only income earner for her household of 8 including her 6 children. With the proceeds from her work she plans to repay the loan, pay school fees for her 5 school age children, and have more money for food and things around the house.\n\nHelp ERDO empower the women of Tumaini to support their families by funding their loans so they can grow their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1632374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase eggs and live chickens for sale at the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

They are women who, in addition to living together in the same village, have gained experience in their respective businesses by participating in the program. The fact that their village is home to the large Louma weekly market helps. The group is bound by solidarity and support, and they all engage in small-scale commerce.\r\n\r\nMariama (who is seated on the far right with her her left hand raised) is the featured borrower for this group. She is 51 years old, married, and a mother of seven children, of whom five are girls and two are boys. She engages in various activities, from running a restaurant to the selling of palm oil.

With the money she will buy fabric, thread, runners etc. Then she will have the material she needs to produce and sell items of clothing, thereby earning more money and capitalizing on her investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1636466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy fabric, thread, runners","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-07-07T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-06T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":830000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68251},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74449},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76682},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78982},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81352},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83792},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86306},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88895},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91562},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99729}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37,"local_amount":68251,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-18T09:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":70006.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517542815},{"amount":40.36,"local_amount":74449,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":76364.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026059},{"amount":41.58,"local_amount":76682,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":78654.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518243},{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":78982,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":81014.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.56,"payment_id":562430874},{"amount":38.17,"local_amount":81352,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83445.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.94,"payment_id":579566612},{"amount":38.97,"local_amount":83792,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":85947.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.46,"payment_id":595164122},{"amount":40.05,"local_amount":86306,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":88526.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.74,"payment_id":611789043},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":88895,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":91182.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.6,"payment_id":624849246},{"amount":86.1,"local_amount":191291,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":196212.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.61,"payment_id":636603333}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T13:46:12Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":731309,"name":"Dilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dilia de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en un municipio \u00e1rea metropolitana de Barranquilla; all\u00ed tiene una miscel\u00e1nea donde ofrece art\u00edculos para el hogar, accesorios femeninos y de papeler\u00eda especialmente.

independently. One of her sons lives with her and helps her with the farm. Saney has a high school education and has been raising livestock and planting crops since 1984. Thanks to her dedication, persistence, and hard work, she currently has a dairy cow, two calves, and 15 sheep. She has everything needed to take care of livestock, including feed and hay.

She has extensive experience in the field of animal husbandry.  Her father used to be involved in the same activity, and Noriniso learned to take care of livestock while helping her father, at a very young age.  When Noriniso was still a child, her father gave her a lamb to take care of.  Noriniso is now a woman with her own family, but her love of animals has remained the same and, to this day, she still raises sheep.  She says that \"her dream has always been to follow in her father's footsteps and to raise her own livestock\".  Thanks to her experience and good knowledge of the business, she has, over the years, increased her herd from 2 head of livestock to 35.  Her entire family helps her with the farming business and supports her in all her endeavors.\r\n\r\nLike all the men in the village, Noriniso's husband works as a day laborer\/builder on construction sites and often travels to Russia for a season to find employment.  Noriniso herself also works as a day laborer in agriculture and works on irrigation projects for a season.  Their combined incomes are not sufficient to provide for their family, and their main source of income actually comes from animal husbandry.   At the moment, given the fact that sheep prices are very low, Noriniso cannot sell any of her livestock without negative consequences for her business.  For this reason, she has turned to MDO Arvand and asked them to support their business.  She plans to use her loan to buy livestock and animal feed.

Her husband is an immigrant in the Russian Federation. Nigina lives in a northern city of Khujand together with her three-year-old son and sister. Nigina learned how to cut and sew women's dresses three years ago. This ability provided her with a source of income. She started to accept orders for sewing women's clothing at home. Nigina likes to spend time at the sewing machine because she loves her work and earns an honest living. Today, Nigina's sewing machine is not working as well as it used to, and she decided to purchase a new machine in order not to slow down work.

Meet David. \r\n\r\nDavid is a smallholder farmer based in Molo, which is a small rural agricultural town in South Rift area of Kenya. He owns a small plot of land where he is based with his family of three children. He also keeps poultry and dairy cattle. For the last six years, David has been selling milk and eggs to make a decent living. \r\n\r\nDavid is particularly passionate about poultry! He has dreams of being a renowned poultry farmer. However, lack of capital for expansion and poor roads leading to market are the key challenges David has to deal with. \r\n\r\nDavid is seeking a loan to purchase a motorcycle. In the rural areas of Kenya with poor road networks, opportunistic farmers capitalize on Indian and Chinese motorcycles (\"boda boda\") to offer transportation. These shuttle services are the only way of getting around and transporting goods in the area.\r\n\r\nYour lending towards this loan will help David cut down on transportation costs, which has been his highest expense for a very long time. Coming from a village where many roads are impassable by vehicles, the boda boda will provide a cheap, versatile, quick, and reliable form of transportation over short and medium distances.\r\n\r\nAcquisition of this asset will enable him to increase his income, save more and educate his children.

in his community for almost two years now. He is 26 years of age, and blessed with children. His wife, Janice, helps him in their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nWhat he basically does is buy LPG tanks from wholesalers, and sells them by the tank with a little profit. LPG tanks can range from small to regular size. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. He will be using the loan to buy more stock of LPG tanks to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nRex dreams that his business will be more profitable, and hopes that it will continue to flourish and help them in their everyday expenses. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week, and he also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1640603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for more stock of LPG tanks to expand his product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-07T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-06T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.69,"local_amount":4666.69,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5091.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517219},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2909.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000179},{"amount":66.64,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2909.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491702}],"funded_date":"2014-07-07T19:30:25Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":733520,"name":"Durdana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Durdana is 59 years old; she is a widow and has three daughters and two sons. \r\n\r\nDurdana raises and sells seasonal vegetables such as pumpkins, cucumbers, potatoes, and so on.

She has a lot of experience in this field through having practised it for over six years.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she is planning on purchasing five 20-litre containers of palm oil, two bundles of brooms and one 20-litre container of lemon juice, which will be resold.

in the village of West Magurmari in the district of Jalpaiguri.  Both Santibala and her husband are illiterate and could not get the opportunity to go to school due to the poor economic resources of their family. With lots of efforts and dedication, she was able to keep her son in school until primary level.  Now he is grown up and works as a mason.\r\n\r\nSantibala's husband has been engaged in agricultural activities for the last 15 years. He is hardworking, honest and a very simple man.  He has been continuing his agribusiness successfully to date.  Santibala works as a homemaker and in her free time helps her husband do agricultural work. Now her husband is 65 years old and has become feeble. So he can't give much effort in his work.  Their son has no consistent income.  So, it is now difficult to cover all the household expenses of the family.  So, Santibala has decided to grow paddy on their farmland.  She has earned a good experience through the work during the last several years.  Since rice is the staple food of the people in this region, she expects a good result from this new cultivation.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a loan from Kiva's partner BJS. She will use the requested loan to purchase necessary supplies to plant paddy such as seeds, manure, and insecticides. She dreams of improving the quality of life for her husband and son through this business. She wants to purchase more agricultural lands with the profit.\r\n\r\nShe is highly grateful to BJS and Kiva for the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1640631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and fertilizers to cultivate paddy rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-07-07T18:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-06T18:50:11Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santibala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-07T22:21:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":733547,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":535.5,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer to maintain his crop.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":207,"posted_date":"2014-07-07T18:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-06T18:50:11Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":93.38,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":214.2,"local_amount":168,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":168.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530248703},{"amount":107.1,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542683575},{"amount":107.1,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561816388},{"amount":107.1,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581735063}],"funded_date":"2014-08-06T02:09:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":733548,"name":"Memoona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Memoona is a 39-year-old married woman.

Meet Paul. He is a hard-working, mixed-farmer from Eldoret, which is a rural town in Kenya, home to many renowned, world-class marathon runners. Paul has 15 years\u2019 experience in growing maize and keeping dairy cows and poultry. He sells milk, eggs, and maize on a local farm, which is a bit far from where his farm is situated. \r\n\r\nKeeping livestock has always been the most enjoyable farm activity for Paul. He named his cows, Kerich (after a person) and Maridadi (meaning, 'the cow decorates his life'). However, the major challenge for Paul and other farmers in the village has been transportation of the farm produce to the market. The roads are unpaved and in very poor condition. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Paul is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders, via Juhudi Kilimo, to purchase a motorcycle. However, not just any motorcycle, but a \u201cBoda Boda.\u201d Boda Boda is an Indian or Chinese standard roadster bicycle, used with locally made carriers and a cushion to transport passengers and goods. This will be customized to transport passengers and farm produce to the market. \r\n\r\nYour lending towards this loan will greatly save Paul the trouble he has been going through for more than a decade, transporting produce to the market. With the motorcycle, he will be able to ferry his produce and that of other farmers, for a small fee, to the market. \r\n\r\nThe additional income he will make from acquiring a motorcycle will go to the education of his three children. He plans to purchase a chaff-cutter with any extra amount of money.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1640595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She has one child. For the past year, Deborah has been working hard to manage her fish business, where she sells fresh fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Deborah has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh fish and cooking oil to fry the fish so she can sell them. This will help Deborah to generate greater profits and take care of her family's basic needs. Deborah hopes that in the future she will be able to build a residential house. \r\n\r\nDeborah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She faces the challenges of seasonality of the business because her peak season is during wedding seasons and student holidays, and high rent costs. She has also been borrowing money from another bank but was referred to UGAFODE Microfinance Ltd for a loan facility by one of our clients who recommended UGAFODE\u2019s rates as friendly and good customer service. She applied for a loan of UGX 1,500,000 to buy hair dryers for her salon so that she will be able to provide quick service to her customers, especially on days when she is working on brides.

Shyamaa, being a homemaker, lives with her children and husband and takes care of all household work.\r\n\r\nShyama's husband has been involved in doing agribusiness on his ancestral lands.  He grows vegetables, such as beans, ladies\u2019 fingers (okra), eggplants, gourds, etc., and sells these to the distributors. \r\n\r\nShyama, who is young and energetic, helps her husband by sowing and harvesting the produce. Together they carry the produce to the market for sale.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of their tireless work, the income from this business is not at all sufficient to cover the household expenses. They thought it over, and have decided to cultivate jute on their farmland. This crop has a good potential and is profitable, too. That's why they have chosen this crop for cultivation.\r\n\r\nWith this aim, Shyama has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase agricultural inputs to cultivate jute. She hopes this loan will help her to respond to her customer demand and at the same time, earn revenue to increase their business activity; thus give better living standards to their family.\r\n\r\nShe conveys her thanks to her lenders (BJS and Kiva)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1640640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase agricultural supplies for cultivating jute on their farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-07-07T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-06T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shyama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T17:34:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":733607,"name":"Ruby","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruby is 46 years old and married with two children.

region of Kenya. He is arguably the most successful client of Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. Tomatoes are David\u2019s flagship produce. He sells more than 150 Kgs of tomatoes every day.<br \/><br \/>Back in 1991, David practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was doing only half an acre of maize crop per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for survival. He kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2008, when he switched to tomato farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for David. <br \/><br \/>Today, David is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. He has already serviced eight asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo! Through the loans, he has acquired high quality dairy cows, irrigation kits, water pumps, farm supplies, a grain mill, a dairy unit, horticultural input, a greenhouse and a tractor.  He has employed four permanent staff from the village to help run his agribusiness. <br \/><br \/>To capitalize more on returns from the booming tomato farming, David is seeking a loan of KES 450,000 to build another greenhouse. Unlike his competition, David conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. <br \/><br \/>Your lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of David\u2019s goal, which is to expand the greenhouse zero. In the future, he is also planning to introduce zero grazing method, intensify his maize farming, and start value

Meet Zakaria, a small-scale farmer based in Muranga, Kenya. The Muranga region is known for production of coffee for export. He and his wife have been blessed with a child. For 14 years, Zakaria has been doing mixed farming. He makes a regular income selling milk, eggs, tea and vegetables at the local market.<br \/><br \/>One of the major challenges Zakaria has had to deal with is lack of cheap affordable labour. He has been forced to do most of the work on the farm by himself. One of the most hectic tasks that other farmers shy away from doing is fodder preparation. For this reason, they just set the cow free to graze on its own. However, Zakaria takes grazing management a bit too seriously to do this. He would rather purchase a machine that will make his work easier and more effective.<br \/><br \/>Zakaria is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter.
