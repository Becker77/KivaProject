Their son renders transportation services to local people using his own microvan. During winter, the ger they live in becomes frozen so they burn lots of coal in order to stay warm. For this reason, he is requesting a loan of 3000 USD to install an electric heater into his ger and insulate its walls with fiberglass.

His wife is unemployed, and stays at home looking after their youngest child. Their eldest daughter works for a state bank as a teller. Also one of his sons studies at college, and this year has advanced to second year. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy building materials such as planks, cement, and bricks for building a barn next to his ger. The barn will serve as an extension, as well as protection against blowing wind. \r\n\r\nIn addition, his family will burn less coal as the ger becomes less vulnerable to heat loss.

He grew up mostly at his mother's side, because his father died when he was 14 as a result of the war during that era. He was the oldest of his three siblings. His wife works in the home. They have been married more than 30 years and have six children, three boys and three girls, 5 of whom are now grown. In his house now it is just him, his wife and two children, the youngest of whom is in 4th grade. <br \/><br \/>Abelino works in agriculture, planing corn, beans and sorghum. He has been in this trade since he became the caretaker for his siblings. When he got married his wife taught him to make hammocks from mezcal, and since then he has done both jobs. His children help him with different aspects of the farm work. When he comes home from the farm, Abelino starts to make the artisan hammocks from husks, with help from his wife, which he will later sell in nearby communities. <br \/><br \/>Abelino needs the loan to buy 6 sacks of compost that he will use for his corn and bean crops, as well as 100 pounds of silk thread to make hammocks of silk and silk blend. He will later sell these to make money that will improve his living conditions and quality of life. He will also pay the rent on the land where he grows his crops. Part of his harvests are sold in the town market. <br \/><br \/>Abelino dreams of improving his home. He would like to plaster t with sand and cement both inside and out. He also hopes to be able to add brick some day. He hopes to continue helping his daughter so that she can stay in school and become a professional one day, since she really enjoys her studies."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":563.86,"image":{"id":1638420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 6 sacks of compost for the bean and corn crops, as well as 100 pounds of silk thread to make silk and polysilk hammocks which will be sold for extra income; also to rent farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-08T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-07T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":96.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":103.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":119.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":127.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":137.03},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":146.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":157.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.94},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.66,"local_amount":96.66,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420952},{"amount":109.66,"local_amount":109.66,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":109.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145323},{"amount":62.43,"local_amount":62.43,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":62.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803828},{"amount":42.71,"local_amount":42.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":42.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482353},{"amount":130.81,"local_amount":130.81,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":130.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974312},{"amount":121.59,"local_amount":121.59,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":121.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752064661}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T00:18:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":733864,"name":"Bebelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bebelina works hard to support her family.

She only manged to finish her High schooling due to economic problems. Since she was very young Omara helped her mother in an establishment that sold clothing. Then she got married and with her husband's poor sales of soft drinks, she started to sell antique paper money to be able to buy her own place to sell clothing.

The oldest is 21 years old and the youngest is 8 years old. Two of them are dependent and live with her. Since her partner died, she is the head of the household and thanks to her business and with a lot of effort, she has been able to move forward. \r\n\r\nShe sells candy and toys. She learned this business together with her older sister who has helped her. She works an average of 10 hours a day, during which she receives help from one of her daughters.

He is a 20 year old who is just about to finish his bachelor's degree. He recently starred in a reality TV show in Rwanda about young entrepreneurship. And, he is the founder and CEO of Habona Ltd, a biogas and waste management plant.\n\nJean Bosco is everything that you look for in an entrepreneur: determined, smart, and hungry. He has assembled a team of local environmental scientists, biogas technicians, and business experts to make sure that his venture has the best chance of success. Last month, he was awarded a contract to manage the waste management plant in his home district of 300,000 people. With this contract, Jean Bosco has secured both the capital equipment and supply of biodegradable waste needed to produce bio-fertilizers for farming and biogas for cooking and lighting.\n\nHowever, in order to successfully operate the waste management plant, Jean Bosco needs upfront working capital to purchase supplies and pay the salaries of his 15 employees.  Based on the agreed upon contract, the district will reimburse Jean Bosco for approximately 75% of his costs after he has proven that Habona can operate the waste management plant for three months.\n\nA loan from Kiva for $5,100 will enable Jean Bosco to pay for initial supplies (uniforms, gloves, brushes, etc) and the salaries for his employees for the first three months.\n\nJean Bosco is one of AEC's most thoughtful, committed, and promising young entrepreneurs.  However, because of his age and the startup stage of his business, it will be nearly impossible for Jean Bosco to receive a loan from a financial institution in Rwanda.  AEC is proud to connect him with the wonderful network of Kiva lenders. Thank you!\n\n(Note: the photos are of Jean Bosco at the waste management factory and at his rural home filming the reality TV

","en":"Bibirukiya was born in 1980. She is married and has three children. She has been fattening cattle at home for about ten years. Her family did not have money, so after graduation she was not able to go to a university. She helped her parents fatten cattle, and within a couple of years she was married. Thus, she became a housewife. She did not sit idly.

Casimily has been doing mixed farming for the last 12 years. He is particularly passionate about dairy farming. His main sources of income are milk, maize, nuts and tea.  Like any serious dairy farmer, Casimily takes animal health very seriously: He constantly worries about disease outbreaks. He checks up on his animals from time to time to ensure they are healthy and protected from common diseases.\n  \nCasimily is seeking a loan to purchase another dairy cow. The identified cow produces more than 10 liters of milk daily. Milk sold from this cow will provide Casimily with a significant amount of income on a daily basis. Money from the sales is enough to clear his loan obligation on time.  Casimily says the extra income he will generate will enable him to save enough money to buy better quality dairy cows. An increase in his personal income will enable him to take better care of his family financially, improve their diet and pay school fees.   \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1635213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-08T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-07T17:40:10Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Casimily","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1926.94},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1978.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2049.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2087.39},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2157.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2201.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2261.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2347.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2385.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2453.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2515.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.9},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.59,"local_amount":4124.32,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4172.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570943},{"amount":23.74,"local_amount":2057.69,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2081.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054312},{"amount":24.32,"local_amount":2107.77,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2132.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547495},{"amount":24.91,"local_amount":2159.05,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2184.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680465},{"amount":24.43,"local_amount":2116.99,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2141.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624755},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":2363.11,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2390.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193826},{"amount":53.41,"local_amount":4628.69,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4682.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261782},{"amount":56.83,"local_amount":4925.68,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4982.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600042},{"amount":16.61,"local_amount":1516.7,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1534.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.89,"payment_id":681376910}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T15:50:56Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":733967,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is a married woman with five children.

Es por ello, que en estos momentos necesita de un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s productos de pl\u00e1stico: vasos, platos, cubiertos y bolsas. De manera que pueda seguir creciendo, ser estable en su negocio y tener suficiente producto para sus clientes. \n","en":"Lidia is characterized as hardworking, enterprising, and a fighter.

","en":"Maria, 35 years old, is very much a fighter. She was not able to finish school due to the economic situation in which her family lived. She lives with two children, who currently make a living in traditional fishing. For 7 years, Maria has made a living selling seafood. She decided to do this work because it is very common where she lives and she lives 100 meters from the beach. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy a fiberglass boat, which will go along with the fishing tackle that her oldest son uses. Maria's dream is to have the tools necessary to face life, earn her daily bread honorably, and in the future, with the earnings that they obtain, be able to build her home for her to lead a decent life and for her son when he decides to have a

motivated women with different loan cycles. The women are still very connected to their roots.  Along with the traditional blue guipiles (blouses) they wear, the women joke in Kaqchikel (one of the many indigenous languages in the area), and cook on an adobe (wood-fired stove).  From these roots, the women move forward to create successful businesses in weaving, artesan products, and small shops. From the generous loans funded by Kiva investors, these women believe that they will be able to advance these businesses and watch them prosper. Magdelena is one of the original members of the Catalinas Trust Bank. Magdalena is starting another loan cycle and has increased her credit throughout the cycles. She sells typical artisan goods, such as blankets, tablecloths, clothes, and more. In order to sell these items, Magdalena requested a new loan to buy various threads for weaving the traditional artisan goods. Magdalena\u2019s success has helped her to send her children to school. Although she cannot read or write, she feels that the opportunity provided through Friendship Bridge will help her to create a better life for each of her five children.  The women are in good spirits as the meeting begins. It is clear that they are close friends and depend on each other for support. Despite this closeness, they each come from a different past in which they have overcome many obstacles. Not a single one of the members attended school as a child. With an average of five children, the women hope to change this statistic in the next generation. Magadalena, along with the other seven members of the group, believe that Friendship Bridge has provided them with an opportunity that they would not have had without them. The eight women are thankful to have this opportunity and are eager to thank their Kiva lenders, who are amazing and grateful people around the world who believe and support their group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":1635628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Jackson is 40 years old and lives in a small town called Molo, which is located in the Rift Valley of Kenya. He has three children and has been doing mixed farming for four years.  His primary source of income is milk, eggs, tea and crops farming. Through mixed farming, Jackson has been able to single-handedly raise his family, because his wife is not employed.\r\n \r\nThe most profitable part of his mixed farming is dairy farming, but the biggest challenge facing Jackson is lack of finances. Jackson is a very hard-working farmer, given that he is able to raise animals while also crop farming. This would be a tall order for most farmers.\r\n\r\nJackson is asking for a loan of KES 40,000 to purchase a motorbike that he will use to transport his farm produce to the market. Due to the poor feeder roads in the area, most farm produce reaches the market when it is not fresh. Then, customers will not buy the goods or they are sold at a throw away price. Jackson's income is impacted and he is not be able to take proper care of his family. This loan will have a turnaround effect on Jackson and his family, by providing them with basic human needs.\r\n\r\nJackson has confidence that this loan will help his business grow and, as a result, the profits generated will be used to improve the living standards of his family. Also, people in his community will benefit, as he will be able to employ more staff on his

They live in Sana'a, Yemen. They have taken a loan 120,000 YER. \r\n\r\nSalwa is 30 years old and married, with two children. Her oldest child is five years old and the youngest one is only one year old. She is an uneducated woman, but she knows her advantage very well. She has a strong determination to improve her standard of living. She began with a small amount of money which she took from  her husband. Salwa invested that money in her own business. \r\n\r\nShe has worked at her business for many years selling makeup and accessories in order to help her husband in the expenses of the family.

He didn't surrender to his condition but decided to work in one of Sana'a's hotels. He worked as a waiter in a high hotel. From that business, Rashad could accumulate a good amount of money, and he opened a sewing store and worked as a tailor.\r\n\r\nIn his store, Rashad is sewing all kinds of stylish men's clothes. He makes modest profits. For further expansion, Rashad applied for a loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase large amounts of fabrics to meet all the demands of his customers.\r\n\r\nRashad looks forward to further
