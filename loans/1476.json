Her husband works in an office. Kalaiselvi has previously taken loans from PAT for the betterment of her livelihood and each time she repaid the loan on time.\r\n \r\nKalaiselvi wants to buy a smokeless stove manufactured by Greenway Grameen Infra Pvt. Ltd. These stoves are better than traditional stoves, as they cook faster and emit less smoke.

Duncan resides in a small town that borders Lake Naivasha, where deforestation and pollution are destroying the precious ecology of his home. He champions the environmental program through selling improved stoves that are efficient and use 60% less fuel, therefore reducing number of trees cut for charcoal and offsetting carbon emissions.\n\nHis greatest challenge is inadequate funds to purchase the cookstoves at a wholesale price. Many of his customers require payment plans, which stretches the working capital of his business.\n\nHe is requesting for a loan to buy more improved stoves for resale to his community with an aim of conserving the environment and creating awareness on the importance of environmental conservation.\n\nHis hopes and dreams are to be a major distributor of improved cooking stoves and empower his

Paula lives with just her husband and one granddaughter whom the couple supports. The granddaughter goes to high school; she is in third year.\r\n\r\nPaula looks after the house and also grows chillis, string beans and other items. Once harvested she goes out to sell these items. Paula has been doing this work for four years, having started after seeing a need for an income in her household. Her husband does not earn much and not enough to support the family, especially the couple's young granddaughter. Their granddaughter goes to the local town to go to school every day and has to take money to pay transportation costs.\r\n\r\nPaula's husband works in farming. He rents land to grow crops. This year the couple will sow crops on 7000 square metres of land. The couple arrives at the land on bus as it is one hour from their house on foot, but only 25 minutes by bus. Paula and her husband work from 6am until 5pm, though stop to rest from noon until 3pm.\r\n\r\nPart of this loan will be used to invest in two bags of manure and two litres of poison. The rest will be used to consolidate a debt that Paula owes to \"CrediCampo\". Last year Paula and her husband lost a large part of their harvest and could not pay off their debt; with this loan they will be able to finish paying it off.\r\n\r\nPaula's dream is to be able to expand her crops and earn a higher income.

She was born in the town of Minero, in the Obispo Santisteban province of Santa Cruz department, Bolivia.\r\n\r\nCarolina currently lives with her parents and is studying for a degree in business administration. She says that, due to family problems, her parents have financial difficulties and so do not have enough money to continue paying for Carolina's studies. Given that her greatest desire in life is to have a profession and in the future to support her parents financially and to do better in life, Carolina has applied for a loan in order to finish her studies.\r\n\r\nCarolina is convinced that, on finishing her degree, she will be able to enter the labour market as a professional and that this will give her financial stability.

She was unable to continue with her studies but now her husband has set her up to do distance learning. She is now in the second year of her high school diploma although she only studies at the weekend. Her husband does agriculture in his spare time, because the majority of the time he he works for the local council as a refuse collector. They have 2 children who still live at home and go to primary school. Only her husband and two children live in the house but she has 2 dependents. \r\n\r\nEsperanza looks after the home but for the last 4 years she has also had a mill. She learnt this business from her family, since when she lived at home her parents had a mill and she was the one who worked there. She says that when she got married she did not just want to rely on her husband to get work and she wanted to work herself, so she suggested to her husband buying a mill to generate an income. She also came up with the idea of setting up a small shop. She does all of this in her home. Her hours for milling are from 8am to 11.30am and from 3pm to 5pm. She chose these hours as she also has to do the household chores.\r\n\r\nHer older son helps out when she has to go out to buy something or go on an errand. At the moment the mill needs repairing, as the motor got damaged and she needs to buy a new one.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is asking for the loan and she also says that she wants to invest in the shop as she feels it is making a profit and so she can help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that God will always keep her family healthy and hopes one day to be able to stock her shop with everything so that her customers leave more satisfied and don't have to go to the nearby town to get what they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1639180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a motor for the mill and buy sugar, rice, oil, eggs and other items for the shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-09T10:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-08T10:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803831}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T12:07:55Z","paid_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":734146,"name":"Oliver","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oliver is a 32-year-old married woman with five children.

For financial reasons she was unable to continue studying although she wanted to and would still like to.

Shatura hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house and buy a car. \r\n\r\nShatura is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1641430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Geoffrey is a small-holder farmer in Kisii which is a primary banana and sugarcane production area in Kenya. He has a wife and a child who depend on him for a living. For the last 6 years, he has been involved in mixed farming. He grows crops and keeps livestock on his farm. His success in agriculture is highly dependent upon him having sufficient access to water. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey is seeking a loan to purchase a water tank. He is planning to harvest rain water during the rainy seasons and preserve it for the dry seasons. The majority of this water will be used for irrigation. An increase in irrigation usage guarantees an increase in crop production on his farm, which does not receive enough precipitation annually.\r\n\r\nYour contribution towards this loan will ensure vegetative growth and development of plants by provision of water in adequate quantity and at the right time. Livestock also have specific water requirements, and these vary depending on local conditions. A water tank for Geoffrey is useful for storage when water is in excess, and it also ensures continuous flow when there is a shortage.\r\n\r\nHe is planning to spend the income generated from this asset to reinvest in better water conservation practices, such as drip irrigation for a brighter future.

Victo is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kasangati in the Kampala south region of Uganda. She has 2 children, who are all currently in school. For the past 3 years, Victo has been working hard to manage her charcoal business, which sells charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Victo has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal, and it will help Victo to generate greater profits and develop the family's well-being. Victo hopes that in the future she will be able to expand on the business. \r\n\r\nVicto is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Meet Paskalia. She is strong, hardworking mother of 2 boys and 2 girls. The 51-year-old lady is a well-known progressive farmer from Nyaura village. She has been doing mixed farming for many years and developed passion for dairy farming. To generate income, she sells produce from her farm including milk at the local market.  \r\n\r\nLike any serious dairy farmer, Paskalia takes animal health very seriously. She believes healthy animals are more productive and cheaper to maintain. The major challenge farmers in her area are facing is lack of good road network. This makes transportation of produce to the market an uphill task and costly.  \r\n\r\nPaskalia is seeking a loan to purchase a quality dairy cow. The cow breed she is going for produces more than 15 litres of milk a day: Milk sold from this cow will provide Paskalia with a sufficient income to repay the loan. Income from milk sales is preferable to many farmers since it comes regularly.  \r\n\r\nPaskalia has a clear business plan. Juhudi Kilimo has been very encouraging and supportive to such progressive farmers.

Meet Wilkister. She is a mother of 2 girls and 2 boys who is practising mixed farming in rainfed Kisii region in Kenya. She sells her farm produce at a local market once a week during the market-day. She has put many years into farming. She also engages in other seasonal businesses around farming to make extra money.\r\n\r\nWilkister is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. She favours poultry farming because of the regular income generation. The additional poultry will boost her egg output. Egg prices are consistent and the market is ready. However, the biggest challenges she faces are poor roads and lack of market for other farm produce since everyone is involved in farming.\r\n\r\nWilkister will use the additional income to take care of her children\u2019s education. Her future dream is to provide her children will everything necessary to help them lead a much improved lifestyle.

For the past 4 years, Alice has been working hard to manage her poultry business, where she rears chickens. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Alice has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more poultry birds, and will help Alice to generate greater profits and carry out personal development. Alice hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nAlice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past 2 years, Christine has been working hard to manage her poultry business, where she rears chickens. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more poultry birds, and will help Christine to generate greater profits and carry out personal development. Christine hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Judith hopes that in the future she will be able to educate her children. \r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1641495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Her primary income sources are eggs, tea and a variety of crops.\r\n\r\nShe is very appreciative of the fact that farming is a fulfilling and sustaining economic activity. Her biggest challenge, however, is raising capital for expansion. She has had dreams of expanding her poultry farming, which happens to be her favourite farming activity. \r\n\r\nLouise is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase poultry and construct a piggery. The purchase of poultry will double the volume of eggs she sells at the market. This investment will double the income she makes from poultry. She is also preparing to invest in pig farming, which is currently performing better than beef farming. \r\n\r\nLouise was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"Uplift myself.\"  This client has also been through a microfinance training session where she learnt about loan management. She understands the expectations that lenders have for the money with which they are entrusting her. \r\n\r\nYour loan will enable Louise to generate enough income to comfortably deal with other farming costs that compose her highest monthly expenses.

He studied as far as second grade, since in his day very few had the privilege of going to school. He got married; his wife is a housewife and does the housework and looks after the children. He has two children who are not at school but work in agriculture alongside him. \r\n\r\nHe has worked in agriculture for more than 25 years and it is his means of earning a living. He learnt the skills from his father. He decided on this kind of work since it provides basic grains for his family's consumption and he sells the excess. His wife and children also work with him doing the jobs which need to be done in the cornfield. He works for more than 8 hours almost every day. \r\n\r\nSince his crop is at the stage where he needs to apply fertilizer he felt the need to apply for this loan to buy manure. He will apply this to his crop so he gets a good harvest and so that there will not be a shortage of food in the house.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to make a good profit from the corn harvest and hopes there will be no shortage of food in the house. He hopes his children will learn a skill which will provide them with an income and hopes they will be able to recommence their schooling."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1639474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy manure to apply to his crop so he can have a good harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-09T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-08T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Lucio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545826}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T17:15:09Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":734244,"name":"Armine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armine is an experienced farmer from Eghegnavan village of Ararat region.

","en":"Aibek is 29 years old, married, and has a daughter. Aibek has a secondary education.  Since 2005 he has worked in agriculture. Thanks to Aibek's diligence and perseverance, the farm currently has two dairy cows and twenty sheep. He also grows crops. Aibek already has taken out one loan from the bank Bai Tushum, which he used to expand his farm. However, on June 1, 2014, his business suffered from severe hail. Two and a half hectares of  irrigated land where Aibek had planted watermelons was destroyed. Aibek has loyal wholesale customers, and sometimes he sells watermelons in the local market himself. Now, however, the business has suffered and he must repay the loan, support his family, and restore his business. Therefore, he appealed to the bank Bai Tushum for a loan of 50,000 KGS for force majeure. The money from the loan will be used to help him do the work he so loves, restore his business, improve his family's living conditions, and possibly build a new house for his currently small, but very friendly, family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1642360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To restore business and  repay the loan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Jar village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-09T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-08T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":129.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aibek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":181.62,"local_amount":10002.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10138.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.42,"payment_id":696500023},{"amount":664.29,"local_amount":39997.8,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":40542.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":115.67,"payment_id":711412146}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T14:55:15Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:09:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":734379,"name":"Selina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selina is a 28-year-old single woman with no children.

Despite their young age, his four children actively and joyfully help on the farm. Aibek has a secondary education. Since 2000, he has kept livestock and farmed. Aibek previously took out a loan from Bai Tushum to expand his farm. However,  on June 1, 2014, there was an accident. Strong hail completely destroyed Aibek's irrigated land, 1.50 hectares of watermelons and 0.50 hectares of mature melon plants.  The melons and watermelons suffered and did not get a chance to ripen. This is Aibek's primary source of income. He has regular customers and sales at the market. Now he must repay his loan and rebuild his business. Therefore, he asked the bank Bai Tushum for a loan of 100,000 KGS. Aibek is a respected man. He is punctual, polite, and has extensive experience in agriculture. He knows all about the technology of agriculture. He is very responsible and enterprising, able to properly run a farm and invest wisely. Money from the loan will help him get back on his feet after the force majeure, this act of nature. In the future, he will plant a new crop to improve his family's standard of living. Aibek's wish is to repair his home and ensure a decent future for his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1642331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"restore his business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhany-Zhol village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-09T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-08T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":285.4,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aibek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1.12,"local_amount":62.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.09,"payment_id":696500022},{"amount":1638.48,"local_amount":99937.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":99999.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":285.31,"payment_id":711412145}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T15:44:17Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:09:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":734313,"name":"Abubakari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abubakari is a master wood carver in Ghana who specializes in wood masks and sculptures.

is 38 years old and only studied through the third grade because she lived far from the school and this made it difficult for her to continue. She lives with her partner, who works in technical support in an organization, and has four children who depend on her financially, three of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nBlanca has always been someone who fights for what she wants. She has worked in farming for more than 10 years, having learned how to work the land from her parents. She also runs a stand selling pupusas (a traditional El Salvadorean dish) from her home for extra income. The land she works is 3 kilometers from her house and nearly every day she walks for 40 minutes to work in the fields. Her children go with her and so does her partner when he is not working.\r\n\r\nBlanca needs this loan to purchase fertilizer and pesticides for her fields so that she can have a good harvest and therefore plenty of food at home.

She has a college degree in biology and used to be a biology teacher. Then she worked as an agronomist for 17 years and as an environmental chemist for 5 years. Now she is retired and works in agriculture. Her main priorities in life are her family's well-being, business prosperity, and her son's happiness. Thanks to her dedication, hard work, and determination, Raisa now has three cows and one heifer. She also plants sainfoin and potatoes on a 0.24 hectare plot of land and has a 0.61 hectare garden with 130 currant plants. She earns about 15,000 som (KGS) per month.

Every member is committed to eliminating poverty; they want to help their families and conquer their poverty.<br \/><br \/>One of the members is named Laura, who in her survey rated a level one on the poverty scale, that is to say she should keep making efforts to improve. She is a housewife, but in order to be able to grow she has been trained to sell cosmetics in her neighborhood in order to generate more income. She says that this loan is to be able to buy various cosmetics to sell. She is grateful for the opportunity that they all are receiving.

As a child, she was able to go to school until the 3rd grade, but then could not continue to the end of primary school due to financial problems. At a young age, she decided to raise a family, and has five children. The oldest is 13 and in the 7th grade, the second is 11 and in the 5th grade, the third is 9 and in the 3rd grade, the fourth is 5 and in kindergarten, and the young is 1 year old. \r\n\r\nAnastacia is very grateful to God for giving her the strength she needs to ensure that her children go to school and don't find themselves in the same situation as she did in her youth, and also for giving her health and life so that she can meet her goals. She and her husband strive on a daily basis to give their children whatever they can so that they can continue studying. \r\n\r\nAnastacia earns a living by growing potatoes with the help of her family. Her parents gave her a piece of land which is suitable for growing, and she has been earning a living this way for two years. The land is located very close to her home, and she gets there by walking or riding a mule, as she doesn't have any other means of transport.\r\n\r\nHer wish is for her crop to have a good yield every season, since this is a source of income for her family and their well-being depends upon it. Anastacia is requesting financial support so that she can provide her crop with the care it needs, by buying supplies which will ensure the yield that she and her family are hoping for in order to get ahead.

Thanks to persistent work, Rysbubu's farm currently has one cow and one calf. \r\n\r\nThe income from the livestock breeding is small, and therefore Rysbubu turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS). She would like to purchase a horse, on which her husband can herd cattle for their fellow villagers. He has been promised a good salary for this. \r\n\r\nRysbubu plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of cattle, and would like to save money for her son's

Raila plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her business, which would allow her to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1643893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Diykan village, Osh  region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-09T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-08T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":70.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4955},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5100},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5249},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5402},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5559},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5721},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5888},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6060},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6237},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6419},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6606},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6804}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.56,"local_amount":4955,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-25T08:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4984.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517463329},{"amount":98.36,"local_amount":5100,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-30T09:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5130.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947344},{"amount":101.23,"local_amount":5249,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5279.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440695},{"amount":103.76,"local_amount":5402,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5433.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":561578515},{"amount":106.79,"local_amount":5559,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5591.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":579489134},{"amount":105.68,"local_amount":5721,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5754.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.65,"payment_id":595436325},{"amount":107.38,"local_amount":5888,"processed_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5922.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.17,"payment_id":610751329},{"amount":108.91,"local_amount":6060,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6095.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.96,"payment_id":624799028},{"amount":452.01,"local_amount":26066,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":26219.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":50.7,"payment_id":636161167}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T17:25:32Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":733277,"name":"G.s.

They are all older with three children who are all still under their responsibility. All of them are hard working and enterprising. What motivates them everyday to do their jobs with love is the dream to see their children become good people. They are natives of the town of Chinandega, an area characterized by being commercially and touristically productive. \r\n\r\nHazel, the coordinator of the group Solidario, is in charge and responsible for making payments on time. She is a small business woman who is dedicated to making and selling filled, scrambled and simple tamales and cooked corn. She started the business more than ten years ago as a dignified means to survive. Her sales are performed on foot and she makes her purchases on credit. She began making 20 tamales and 20 cooked corn. Today she makes 190 tamales and 150 cooked corn. She has had great demand for her products. She begins her daily routine the day before by starting to shell the corn. Then, very early on the following day, she grinds the corn and collects the curd, milk, salt. After, she prepares the dough to later make tamales that will be scrambled, simple or filled and finally makes the fire in which to put them and have them ready for the afternoon when she leaves to sell the products. One of her dreams is to be able to see her children grow and become professionals as well as perform improvements to her house and grow her business more to obtain better income. The objective of this loan is to buy raw material to make her delicious product such as maize, sugar, salt, firewood, leaves, cheese, curd, milk, among other products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1640100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Tazhinisa has a secondary-specialized, medical education and worked at a hospital for many years. She has been involved in sewing national-style blankets, drapes and pillows for the last 10 years. Her hand-made work is in high demand, the sales of which yield about 10,000 som (KGS) per month. However, Tazhinisa's sewing machine is very old and often breaks down, and this is why she requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a new sewing machine. Tazhinisa plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her business and improving her living

her community for almost a year now. She is 38 years of age and blessed with children. Her husband, Lito, helps her in their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.<br \/><br \/>She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.<br \/><br \/>Due to financial insufficiency, Jossie wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail herself of a loan amounting to 10,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional merchandise like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products that are needed to increase her product inventory. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.<br \/><br \/>Jossie dreams of being rich through all her hard work. She hopes that she could always help in providing for their needs. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1642022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional supplies and merchandise like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-09T22:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-08T22:10:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jossie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517225},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2909.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000185},{"amount":83.31,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491708},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":727.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561624900}],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T03:57:06Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":734553,"name":"Tunu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose, who is in her late thirties, is living alone with her own six children, three of whom are in school and the rest who are small.

member, pictured with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nPhakhochong and her family reside in a hilly region of Manipur in the northeastern states of India. She is married and blessed with three children. The eldest daughter is in beginner class, whereas the younger ones haven\u2019t started schooling. Her husband is a cultivator by profession, and his income is unreliable and undependable. Therefore, the family\u2019s sustainable resource is very scant. \r\n\r\nPhakhochong wanted to engage herself in any income-generating business. However, since her kids are still young, they need extra care, and she could not neglect them. For the fulfillment of the required family expenditures, Phakhochong rears some chickens in her home yard. Her husband used to take the fully grown chickens to the market and sell them for more profit. Sometimes the villagers come and buy them from her house, too. \r\n\r\nShe wanted to raise more chickens and expand the poultry. However, the light irregularity in the village is a hindrance to her small-income business. During the rainy season, the power supply is very poor in the village; hence, the chickens used to die due to insufficient heat supply inside the coop. \r\n\r\nPhakhochong wanted to avail a Kiva solar loan, with which she can buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system to light up the poultry at night and also to keep the chickens warm during the rainy season. Since it can light up 4 light bulbs for 12 hours a day and has a 90-meters-long wire, it can be installed in any four adjacent rooms as per the user\u2019s convenience.\r\n\r\nWith the little profit she gets, Phakhoneng will use the money to manage her family\u2019s expenses. She also wanted to save a little amount from the income for her children for their future use. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the members, too, want to avail a solar loan for their own respective income-generating business activities, such as a grocery store, vegetable vending, and also for their children so that they will be able to study in the evening by the light of these solar systems. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1642008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a mini solar home lighting system to light up her poultry at night.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-07-09T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-08T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phakhochong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemjalhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neisi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60865,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60865}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-10T14:59:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":734565,"name":"T.khonom Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lhingkhohoi lives in New Keithelmanbi in Manipur, India, with her husband, two daughters and a son.

Seasonally, he makes charcoal and sells it in the market, too. \r\n\r\nTo manage the household expenses and children\u2019s school expenditures with just the meager income of her husband is a great concern for Lhingkhohoi and her husband. The living expenses and the children\u2019s educational expenses, such as the school van monthly fare and tuition fees, are increasing, whereas the income of the family is still stagnant. \r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to supplement the household income, Lhingkhohoi and her group members took an initiative to uplift their economic and financial status by accessing loans. \r\n\r\nLhingkhohoi opened a pan shop near her house. Since the shop is near a national highway, it attracts lots of customers. She used to earn 1,000 INR per day, but due to irregular power supply in the village, she could not continue her business smoothly after sunset. Therefore, she wanted to avail a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system loan as a backup to light up her pan shop to run the business until late hours. Lhingkhohoi shares that working without proper lighting makes her slow down her work, and attending customers in improper lighting is very inconvenient. She believes that by installing this solar light, her business will improve, and at the same time, make her tasks easier to complete. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the team members also need mini solar lights for their respective income-generating activities.

community for almost fifteen years now. She is 36 years of age and blessed with four children. Her husband, Roderick, works as a product dealer, and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Divina earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Divina wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan of 14,000 PHP (Philippine pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nDivina hopes to add more stock of grocery items she presently doesn't have in her storehouse. She dreams that she could help her children to finish their studies through her humble business. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1642033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is doing fine with the loan and appreciates Kiva for their support of their group.  He used the profits to pay school fees and covered household expenses.  He will use this loan to buy Irish potatoes, cooking oil, charcoal for cooking, and to renovate the selling place by putting in tiles, a washing sink and umbrellas.  He dreams of buying a plot of land. Steven will share this loan with his loan group \"SARANGA\" with the two members holding each other accountable for paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1642073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
