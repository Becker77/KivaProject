Piala started this business for the sake of supporting her family and parents rather than looking to her husband for all their needs. She is a different mother, working hard and she desires to improve her shop and build a nice house. Piala opens her business from 6:30 am to 5 pm daily and is able to make a good profit.\r\n \r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, this is her fourth loan request.

This is Cyrus. He is the Head Teacher of Grand Maria Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Nabbigo in Wakiso with 180 students. Grand Maria Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a Tulip water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase Tulip Filtration water treatment system, with 10 Sets of 20 Litre Buckets which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nGrand Maria Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She has a secondary education with a specialization in teaching and worked as an educator for a long time before becoming the superintendent at a kindergarten. She has been raising livestock and planting potatoes and corn since 1982. Thanks to her hard work, Susarkan currently has two dairy cows and two calves. Her total income is 15,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to expand her farm, she applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with the Bai-Tushum Bank in order to purchase a calf and turkeys for breeding.

She also engages in other small businesses to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nThe mother of three enjoys mostly attending to her farm animals and tilling land. Marketing of her produce and seasonal drought poses challenges for this undeterred farmer. She makes a point to name all the animals on the farm. Her favorite dairy cow goes by the name Kairu.\r\n\r\nMedoline is seeking a loan to go into cereal farming. She wants to start growing cereal crops for human food and animal feed. In the future, she sees herself producing cereals for industrial starch. \r\n\r\nMedoline made up her mind to join Juhudi Kilimo since it is the only microfinance organization in Kenya that supports marginalized rural smallholder farmers to get loans. \r\n\r\nShe is very optimistic that this loan will increase her income so that she can afford to pay for her children\u2019s education.

For the past 4 years, Moses has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells essential commodities. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Moses has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential goods like sugar and salt for the business, and will help Moses to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children in better schools. Moses hopes that in the future he will be able to expand the business into a bigger wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nMoses is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

On the farm, she lives with her husband.  They have been practising mixed farming for the last nine years. Their three children pay a visit from time to time, and offer assistance on the farm when needed. Her primary income sources are eggs and tea produced from the farm; she sells these at a local market.\r\n \r\nSome time back, Alice joined a self-help group composed of mostly marginalized female farmers named Mawiri SHG. All the members of this group were in search of some income generative activity. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo motivated them to seize the opportunity of each member securing a loan, and have the rest of the members guarantee each other.  After being successfully registered, they went through a training of basic financial and business skills. \r\n\r\nAlice applied for a loan of KES 65,000 to purchase poultry, a dairy goat and to construct a piggery. \r\n\r\nShe is a successful poultry farmer who is looking to expand the poultry section and diversify into other activities. She is always cautious when approaching new business opportunities. The fact that she spends most of her time at the farm makes her confident that she can take good care of the goats and pigs. \r\n\r\nIncome generated from these investments will be enough to meet her farm expenses. She says her family will also get to enjoy all the benefits that come along with increased income.

After finishing university, she worked in the field she specialized in for several years, but for family reasons she switched to having her own business. She opened a small business with a low turnover. She expanded her business stepwise, and her small \"market\" turned into a proper store. \r\n\r\nBishafoat has fifteen years of experience from working in retail. Every year she offered more branded products to the customers in her smal store. Due to seasonality, all her money is bound up in her products. She only has a little bit of money on her hands, and they go to different living costs. \r\n\r\nBishafoat decided to freshen up her apartment and renovate the bathroom. All the old pipes have long been rusty and dripping. She needs to repair and change the pipes, but she does not have sufficient money for this. Therefore she turned to \"MDO Arvand\" for help. She hopes for support and thanks everyone sincerely.

She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs and various food crops at a local town. \r\n\r\nMargaret enjoys making an income from farming. One of the challenges she faces is low sales due to low production volume. A solution to this challenge is seeking a loan to acquire an additional dairy cow. The dairy cow will provide her lots of practical benefits. She believes the pasture she gives to her cow provides great-tasting dairy products that are more nutritious and flavorful than those processed and sold at shops.

Through dairy farming and poultry keeping she has been able to produce milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nMargaret is a very dedicated farmer who has a never-say-die attitude and enjoys every bit of farming because, through farming, she is able to take care of her family\u2019s needs and wants. Although she experiences challenges in farming her attitude keeps her going. Thoroughly enjoying what she does, she has even nicknamed the 3 cows that she has, namely Tulmet, Birirmet and Chenwach.\r\n\r\nMargaret is seeking a KES 63,100 loan to be able to buy a dairy cow and increase the number from the three that she currently has. Through the loan she would be able to increase her milk productivity and also increase her income levels, hence reducing the poverty levels that are currently facing her.\r\n\r\nMargaret's biggest

Her children are already grown-up and self-sufficient. They live close to her in separate homes, but they visit her everyday and help her with her business. Only one remaining child depends on her. Despite her age, she works hard and helps her family financially. This year especially was not easy for her. The winter was very cold and she used up all of her cattle feed reserves. She was unable to buy new feed and was forced to sell one cow for very little money. Now she has two lambs. She fattens them up and will sell them in autumn. She really hopes that, although she will be able to receive a small income, it will cover all of her expenses. <br \/><br \/>Narziniso is also a seamstress. She sews ethnic Tajik dresses. Everyone in her village knows her and uses her services. Despite the fact that her household lies on her delicate shoulders, she manages to serve her clients on time and sew them beautiful ethnic Tajik dresses. In order for her dresses to turn out even more beautiful and conform to modern styles, Narziniso wants to buy an embroidery machine. For this reason, she turned to MDO \"Arvand\" for a loan. She thanks everyone in advance for their financial

The loan will be used to  buy more sodas, juice, sugar, and dry cells and will help Patrick to generate greater profits and expand on the business. Patrick hopes that in the future he will be able to open up another restaurant. \r\n\r\nPatrick is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

For the past 3 years, Aisha has been working hard to manage her food stall business, where she sells vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aisha has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy cabbage, tomatoes, onions, and bananas, and will help Aisha to generate greater profits and educate her children. Aisha hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nAisha is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is 22 years old and lives in the town of Sironko in the Mbale region of Uganda. She has one child who is currently in school. For the past three years, Joy has been working hard to manage her bar business, which sells beers, sodas, and spirits. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joy has requested a loan of 700,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more beers, sodas, and spirits, and will help Joy to generate greater profits and improve on her life style. Joy hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nJoy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Rita is 21 years old and lives in the town of Sironko in the Mbale region of Uganda. She has one child who is currently in school. For the past three years, Rita has been working hard to manage her school business, which sells text books. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rita has requested a loan of 600,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase books, and sideboards, and will help Rita to generate greater profits and to provide necessities for her family. Rita hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nRita is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

This support is very generous and does not harm peoples' lives.

Guatemala. It is well-known throughout the country for the production of intricately woven \u201cikat\u201d or \u201cjaspe\u201d skirts called \u201ccortes.\u201d These colorful treasures have been proudly worn by indigenous women throughout Guatemala for over a century. Here, 10 women have formed a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cAmistad\u201d or \u201cFriendship.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe ladies are requesting a second loan from Kiva investors. They are quite proud that they have been able to successfully conclude their previous loan cycle. The women share that their businesses have grown, and that they are ready to invest more in their work.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we reported on Gregoria, a married 36-year-old woman with two children. For this loan cycle, she has been elected secretary of the group, a role that she efficiently carries out. Gregoria has a textile business and sells beautiful, typical blouses called \u201chuipiles,\u201d traditional skirts or \u201ccortes,\u201d as well as elaborate belts and aprons. Her husband and children work with her in the business. With the entire family involved, there are enough funds for her two teenage children to attend school.  \r\n\r\nGregoria is requesting a loan to purchase additional textiles that she will sell in three different locales. She is a determined woman and has a firm plan for the growth and expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nThe women of the \u201cAmistad\u201d Trust Bank have created an atmosphere of trust and support. They share the common desire to progress and support their families. The ladies understand the importance of education, not only for their children but for themselves as well. The majority of them were not able to attend school and so the educational component of their monthly meetings is very valuable for them. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer presents timely and useful information about effective business practices (accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing, pricing) as well as health, hygiene, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants. With education, the ladies become empowered and more confident. They learn about women\u2019s rights, violence against women and self-esteem. Friendship Bridge calls the effective combination of the loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregoria and the women of the \u201cAmistad\u201d Trust Bank appreciate the opportunity to secure a loan and move ahead. We look forward to reporting on their progress in the very near future. Thank you, Kiva investors!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":1641772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To diversify her inventory of clothing.

As what you have seen in the photo Lydia carrying a basket, inside on it is the pack of fish weigh per kilo and pack with the plastic bag where she sells in the area.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1635687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional stocks of fish to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Puerto Princesa, Palawan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2014-07-11T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-10T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":760}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":144,"local_amount":6080,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6233.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517605882},{"amount":90,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T15:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3895.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530160496},{"amount":72,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-26T09:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3116.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":545018040},{"amount":90,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T14:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3895.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561710625},{"amount":54,"local_amount":2280,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579646144}],"funded_date":"2014-07-15T08:31:25Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T14:05:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":730847,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta is 43 years old and married with four children.

This is not at all sufficient for her to manage the household expenses, business investments and educational expenses of her children.  \r\n\r\nGunadei has a dream of giving a better education to her children. So she and her husband decided to admit their elder son in a private school. But scarcity of money was a problem for her. When Mahashakti Foundation started the education loans, Gunadei applied and took a loan of 10,000 INR for the educational expenses of her elder son who is there with her in the photograph. With this loan, she will pay the admission fee, tuition fee and arrange study materials like books etc. This will encourage her son as well as Gunadei to take a future course of action. She is very hopeful that she will be able to respectfully stand her children in the society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1642530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay admission fees and tuition fees and arrange for study materials for her son","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BADI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-11T01:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-10T01:30:04Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gunadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-11T02:39:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":732360,"name":"Grezel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grezel is 23 years old, a married woman with two children, one of whom is in school.

Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are earning as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Teresita wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like a loan of 10,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional merchandise like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products that are needed to increase her product inventory. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to be able to save for her family and she dreams of good health for each and every member. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Jose, a 68-year-old farmer is no exception. Several years ago, this man started to work in agriculture.  He didn't think that he would make it, as he had only ever studied primary education due to financial difficulties when he was young. \r\n\r\nHe is the father of three adult children who help him work as well as he can.  He has a beautiful wife who always supports him, day after day.   \r\n\r\nA short time ago, Jose asked for a loan from MiCredito-Kiva to cover the costs of sowing a plot of land with corn together with the purchase of labor, fertilizers and fungicides. He is very grateful because he can see the good results.  \r\n\r\nNow, as the season starts again, he is asking for a new loan for a tobacco harvest.  For this he needs to buy fertilizer, a watering machine and to pay for labor costs.   \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he hopes that he will continue to be successful and generate an income which will allow him to make improvements to his home and offer the best quality of life to his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1641600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer, watering equipment and labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-07-11T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-10T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Benito\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":965,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":965}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":965,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681395259}],"funded_date":"2014-08-07T14:57:05Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T15:18:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":735148,"name":"Sela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sela is a 36-year-old married woman with six children.
