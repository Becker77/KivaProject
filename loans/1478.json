This is their fourth farming loan with Soro Yiriwaso, with whom their previous loans were paid back in full.\r\n\r\nOumou, the woman standing third from the right in the back row of the photo, grows peanuts, rice and millet. With this loan, she is planning on purchasing farming inputs and seeds, as well as paying for the labour costs to maintain two hectares of land. After the harvest, the produce will be sold in Dialakoroba to a customer base made up of resellers and consumers. She is planning on making a profit of 195,000 FCFA with each harvest, which will allow her to pay off the loan and help her husband with their family's daily living expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1644153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for labour costs, seeds and farming inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bananzole","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-07-11T12:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-10T12:50:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":155.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sata                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bamy                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayira                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia                               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":485000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":485000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":869.92,"local_amount":485000,"processed_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":494195.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":155.08,"payment_id":624542276}],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T13:40:03Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T13:45:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Smith","image":null}},{"id":735166,"name":"Nang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A citizen from a rural village located in the Kampong Cham province\u2019s Prey Chhor district, Nang is 44 years old and married.

He buys fish at the local fish port early in the morning. There are many patrons who prefer his products since they are assured of freshness and cleanliness. His store is located in a temporary fish market. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nLeodigario is taking out PHP 19,000 loan to continue operations of his business. He will be using the loan to buy more fish, which are necessary to increase his inventory.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wants to have his own fish stall in the market. He hopes for his income to boost and that his business will continue to help him to improve their general living condition. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

in the hill town of Manipur. She is 44 years old, smart and talented. She works hard to support her family even though she is still single. \r\n\r\nIn order to support herself and reduce the family\u2019s financial worries, she took the initiative to open a garment shop in the main town market on rent. In her shop she keeps items like shirts, shoes, gowns, hand-woven bags, etc. She gets some of the supplies from the capital state and for some she uses her own expertise and designs them. Her hand-made items are well known in the locality and people love her creations.\r\n\r\nChingngaihniang says she has been doing this business for the past eight years. She is very happy with the turnover she gets from the business. She wants to expand the shop and increase her inventory. The sales are high during the holidays, occasions and festive season. \r\n\r\nChingngaihniang says the business is special to her because it makes her happy; her favorite part about being in this business is giving customer service and getting profits. She use the income to manage the family's affairs and she saves what is left in the bank.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, however, the poor power supply in the area hampers her work. It is difficult to work past sunset due to poor power supply. Since she does not have any alternate source of power supply to rely on, she wants to avail a Kiva solar loan to buy 45-watt solar lighting systems, each having four bulbs. Once the system is installed in her store, she will be able to open the shop past sunset or even at night hassle-free, and this will bring her more income and the ability to afford better living standards.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members also need solar loans for their income-generating activities. The other members are engaged in weaving, variety store, second-hand business and the like. Also, some of the group members have children, and they will be able to study in the evenings by the light of these solar systems.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1642845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy 45-watt mini solar home lighting to install in her garment shop to open the store for longer hours after sunset.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-07-11T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-10T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nianglianmoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimzaniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niangnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chingngaihniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamkhannuiang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinmuankim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chingzangai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiingaihnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thangmawi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemngaihlian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimthiannei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamlunhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimzalam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":158249,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":158249}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T15:46:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":735201,"name":"Sylivia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylvia's Group is comprised of hardworking women.

For the past 3 years, Eva has been working hard to manage her hotel business, which sells cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Eva has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food items and will help Eva to generate greater profits and increase on her business. Eve hopes that in the future she will be able to divert to a clothing business. \r\n\r\nEva is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum to receive life-skills

group. All the group members live in the same vicinity. \r\n\r\nHatneitling says she has always been interested in weaving since childhood. She used to weave before her marriage and continued this profession after marriage. She weaves traditional shawls and ladies' wrap-around skirts and sells them for 2,500 to 3,000 INR. She says that these items are in high demand at the market and have no risk of expiration. Demand for Hatneitling products is high during holidays and festive seasons, which in Manipur fall in the months of March, October, November and December. They are used as gifts on occasions like weddings, childbirths, send-off ceremonies,  Ningol Chakkouba (married daughters\u2019 home visit) and house-warmings. She cannot meet customer demand on time due to shortage of her products, so she wants to continue her weaving even after sunset to speed up her work and also to increase her inventory. \r\n\r\nThe power supply in her area is a big hurdle to her income generating activity, however. The solar loan will help her to buy a 45-watt solar home lighting system, which will light up four light bulbs for 12 hours a day. Since it has a 90-meter-long wire, it can be installed in any room in the house for one\u2019s convenience. She believes that this solar lighting will serve her purpose in meeting her customers' demands and can raise her income since she can work extra hours after sunset. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members need solar loans for their respective income-generating activities.

","en":"Damir is a cheerful young man who loves his work. His woodwork is always in high demand even though his pieces cost more than similar ones made of plastic and other materials. According to Damir, his higher prices are due to the cost of the natural materials he uses and the complexity of the process. Wooden furniture can make any room more inviting and wooden frames and doors are considered to be more environmentally friendly. Some things just cannot be made from a material other than wood. He feels that his carpentry business needs a relatively small investment, though it is true that the profits are also fairly small. He understands that this is due to a few factors, the most important being the range of his business activities, the quality of his products, and his methods of marketing. He does everything on his own without any advertising and makes a variety of furniture, including traditional chests. \r\n\r\nDamir is planning to purchase the materials to make furniture. He hopes that it will help his business to take a loan to buy lumber and increase his production.

They take care of their families and chores all day, so most of their spare time that could be used to weave or work extra hours is past sunset.\r\n\r\nSince they do not have any alternate source of power supply to rely on, they have decided to help themselves, and seek a solar loan of 45-watt solar lighting systems, each having four bulbs. Once the system is installed in their homes, they will be able to work even at night hassle-free and this will bring their families more income and the ability to afford better living standards.

three dependent children.

Chho has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for the past four cycles with successful repayment history. Now, she is the leader of a group of five members.

Though he is uneducated, he was aware of the importance of education and enrolled all the members of his family in schools and universities.\r\n\r\nMohammed is a symbol of industry and hardwork. Since he was young, he was responsible for himself. His story started when he immigrated to Saudi Arabia to work, but his journey ended after some years when he was forced to come back to Yemen during the Gulf War in 1990. This was a critical point in his life. Mohammed didn\u2019t surrender and decided to cultivate his own piece of land in the village and secure a decent life for himself and his big family. Year after year, he was able to accumulate a good amount of money to purchase his own house and dump truck to diversify his income sources. He uses this truck to transport loose materials such as sand and gravel to construction sites. This business is profitable, especially because there are not many dump trucks in the city to cover the increasing demand; Therefore Mohammed decided to buy another dump truck. The problem is that he doesn\u2019t have enough money, so he applied for a loan in the amount of 1,500,000 YER from Al-Amal Microfinance Bank. Mohammed is sure that purchasing another truck will increase his income and he will be able to successfully repay the loan and pay for his children's marriages in the near future.\r\n\r\nMohammed looks forwards to purchasing another bigger and better dump truck and will encourage his children to work on the other two trucks to cover their expenses and become independent.

Gulbahor is the sole breadwinner for her 2 children because she is divorced and provides for her children by herself. She has been involved in animal husbandry for over 2 years. She primarily fattens up cows and sells milk to local residents. Gulbahor has been wanting to repair her house for many years because her house is in a bad condition.

It is very popular now to make computer embroideries with various decorations according to customer requests. Hand-made embroidery is a very long and labor-intensive work, and this is why it is expensive. Current decorations are in style now, and there are more orders for these types of decorations. Manzura has been going to her friend to make computerized embroidery, and this has been costing her more because she had to pay for this service.

Their families are forced to divert a considerable share of their means towards the purchase of kerosene, as it is an expensive fuel.  Besides, the lamps are putting the health of the family members at risk as they emit lethal gases while burning kerosene.

So, they are looking for support in the form of a loan of 146,076 INR to buy solar lighting devices, each costing 12,173 INR.

providing high-quality, low-cost or free healthcare to the world's poor. Possible is providing support to Jayagadh Health Clinic as part of their partnership with the government of Nepal.\n\nThe loan will be used to install a solar energy system at Jayagadh Health Clinic in the remote far-Western region of Nepal. The solar energy system will be 1.6 kW in size, and will include a battery back-up system to ensure that lights and medical equipment can be run in the evenings. The loan will pay for the upfront costs of the solar energy and battery storage system.\n\nReliable energy is a critical part of delivering high quality health care.  Because of an existing lack of reliable energy at Jayagadh Health Clinic:  \n    - Midwives have to hold flashlights with their mouths to deliver babies at night - and over 120 babies are born at Jayagadh each year.  Solar energy will provide adequate lighting.\n    \n    - The clinic is unable to procure a vaccine refrigerator due to poor electricity supply. With solar energy, they will be able to power a vaccine refrigerator and provide essential vaccines after birth.\n    \n    - Other simple medical equipment such as oxygen machine and suction machine can prevent complications during childbirth, but without reliable energy, this equipment cannot be used.\n    \n    - Snakes are sometimes an issue during the rainy season, and without lighting the patients and staff are afraid to go to the clinic at night. Solar powered light will help ensure that people feel safe going to the clinic.\n\nAvishek (pictured), SunFarmer's Director of Engineering - Nepal, has been deeply involved in this project and brings years of experience in providing reliable energy to health clinics, schools, and communities throughout rural Nepal.  He will be overseeing ongoing maintenance of the system and loan repayment.\n\nPossible is a leading nonprofit organization, which was named a \"Top 1%\" charity by Givewell in 2011. Possible is a highly visible and well-known organization in Nepal, where it employees over 160 Nepalis and runs Bayalpata Hospital, a large community hospital that treats over 4,000 patients each month. Possible has operated Bayalpata Hospital since 2007 and has managed to attract support from the local community as well as government stakeholders.\n\nJayagadh Health Clinic is located in a very remote and hilly area of Nepal. Grid electricity is unavailable for 12 to 20 hours a day, and when it does arrive is often very low voltage. Alternatives such as diesel are highly polluting, expensive, and are often not delivered to such remote areas. Solar is the most cost effective and reliable energy solution for health clinics like Jayagadh.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":939.18,"image":{"id":1641496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical

Thanks to the support they have given he will be able to buy a car and  increase his income as a driver and not have to pay for the rental. \r\n\r\nThis way he will be able to improve the quality of life for his family and to keep working hard to give his son a good quality education. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1641739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to buy a vehicle for work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2014-07-11T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-10T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":135.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":138.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":143.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":151.39},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":155.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":162.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":167.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":174.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":183.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":188.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":195.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":202.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofie Bjorksten","image":null}},{"id":735340,"name":"Soran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soran is 23 years old and a single man.

During the loan period, they have managed their businesses well. They maintain sows and the sows can give birth to up to 12 piglets. But not all of them do - some also give birth to 6\u20138 piglets, depending on the type of the sow. The superior sow can give birth to more piglets than the local sow.\r\n\r\nNi Ketut is very happy because her sow gave birth to 11 healthy piglets and she sold all of them. She kept them for two months and then sold them to the other breeders in her village. She used all the profits as capital for her pig business. Given this success with her sows, Ni Ketut continues her business as a piglet seller. Her piglets are of good quality because she keeps them well and gives them nutritious feed and vitamins. She has also become an example to other breeders, not only in her group, but also in her village. With another loan of the same size, Ni Ketut will use her loan to purchase superior quality feed and to renovate her pigs' cage. She hopes her plan will go smoothly.\r\n\r\nTwo of the members of this group decided to resign after they earned enough profits from their pig businesses and were able to continue their businesses with their own money.

A 48 year old mother, she took over the prime responsibility of raising her teenage son after her divorce 15 years ago. Following her divorce Bekhal\u2019s work as school clerk did not provide enough income to cover her and her son\u2019s expenses. To supplement her income, she worked in the evenings for almost three years, making handicrafts and knitting wool to provide an extra income. When she realized that this extra income would not cover the increasing expenses of her growing son, she decided to build on her old hobby of hair dressing and open her own beauty salon.\n\nAlthough she was faced with many difficult challenges, including a lack of capital, Bekhal refused to give up. She worked in a salon for two years learning her trade and saving money. Over time, she saved enough to attend professional training in Turkey and finally opened her own salon in 2004. Though she remembers the difficult times she faced, Bekhal is proud of her achievements and has become a strong entrepreneur who has been able to prove her worth to her family and her society.\n\nThrough the creation of her salon, Bekhal was able to create two job opportunities for other community members and expects to increase her number of employees as her business develops. Her growing business and willingness to cultivate her occupational skills qualified her to participate in the WLIFT program and take an SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of 12,000 USD. With this money, Bekhal hopes to expand her business by purchasing additional equipment that will improve her clients\u2019 experience, including massage chairs; manicure and pedicure tools and equipment; and

They all live in the town of Diakobougou, in the Segou region (fourth largest region of the Republic of Mali). They know each other through neighbours, family and relations, and they conduct revenue-generating activities in the village. They sell condiments and grains for a living. In order to boost their working capital, the members of the group have decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first cycle of a solidarity loan. \r\nMadame Nematou (the second lady standing - from right to left in the photo) is a large retailer of condiments in the village and its surrounding areas. She aims to use her loan in order to purchase 5 baskets of tomatoes, and 10 baskets of onions from the gardeners of the village.

She went to school as far as the fourth grade, but due to a lack of money in her family she was unable to continue studying.  However, what she was able to learn is very useful to her today.  Her husband has been a farmer for 15 years, and works hard to support his family.  They only had three children, and are now living alone because their children are all living in their own homes.  She has been a homemaker her whole life, but also earned income from her home by raising animals. She has chickens, pigs and cattle which she cares for every day, and when she needs money she sells one of them.  She learned everything that she knew from her mother at a young age.  She has no other occupation.  Her husband helps her with her chores, from the time that she wakes up until she goes to sleep.  The loan will be investing in buying 3 pigs to fatten, raise and sell.  It will help her by allowing her to continue doing the work that she likes with animals, which she can do from home.  Her dream is always to be with her husband, now that only the two of them are living in the house.  She hopes to continue giving advice to her children so that they will be good people.

In February 2014, Arlene availed a PhP 6,000 loan from SEED and ventured into selling quick-cooked snack items to include sandwiches and fries. The business went well and correspondingly Arlene was able to pay back her loan without any mispayments.\n\nFrom this experience, Arlene said she tried studying other opportunities which would make her business earn more. She was able to identify the lack of stores selling scrap wood used for cooking and rice that would meet the demand of the neighborhood. Thus, with this new loan, she is planning to buy scrap wood, 3 sacks of rice and additional canned goods that would make her store more competitive. \n\nArlene, dreams of growing her business more and becoming a wholesaler in their area.

is a 27- year-old housewife and her husband Rogelio is 28 years old.

They share their home with Julieta\u00b4s father and brother, Adan and Te\u00f3filo respectively. \nThe family lives in a very small house made of metal sheets in Oaxaca, Mexico. In the municipality they live and according to government information sources, 227 houses (representing 14.3% of the total houses) have just one room and 226 houses (representing 16.8% of the total houses) have dirt floor.\nRogelio works in a grocery store as a driver, Adan is 69 years old and he sells popsicles and ice-creams in the city. Julieta prepares and sells \u201ctortas\u201d (a kind of Mexican sandwiches) outside a local school in order to have extra incomes. \n\nTe\u00f3filo is 22 years old and works in the city doing different activities related to graphic design.\n\nDue the bad conditions of the house (leaky roof, one bedroom shared among all, extreme cold when its winter and extreme heat when it\u00b4s summer, one bathroom located outside the house), Julieta\u00b4s dream is to own a better house where they can live happier and peaceful. In the end, owning a new house means the Carlos Daniel\u00b4s legacy.

This new roof will give her a proper shelter and finishing the walls will help keep the house warm during winters and cold during those hot summer days. \nJosefina is thankful for this opportunity and recognizes that with these credits, she will finish her house in a fraction of the time that it would take her without this help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1482337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to add cement roof to the house and finish walls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Totolapan, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":301,"posted_date":"2014-07-11T22:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-10T22:50:14Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":972.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":997.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1022.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1047.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1073.98},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1100.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1128.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1156.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.26,"local_amount":972.97,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T10:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517533957},{"amount":79.2,"local_amount":997.3,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1028.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530017029},{"amount":81.18,"local_amount":1022.23,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1054.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542508840},{"amount":83.21,"local_amount":1047.78,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1080.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561642289},{"amount":82.63,"local_amount":1073.98,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1107.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.66,"payment_id":579552811},{"amount":86.13,"local_amount":1100.83,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1135.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.29,"payment_id":595153403},{"amount":86.06,"local_amount":1128.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1164.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.54,"payment_id":610550287},{"amount":84.73,"local_amount":1156.56,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1193.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.11,"payment_id":624222679}],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T15:55:29Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T11:08:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":737797,"name":"Nestor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nestor and his family live in Oaxaca, Mexico.

between 4 and 14.\r\n\r\nHis main source of income is farming, where he grows crops like maize and other crops like beans. He is also a cattle keeper. He has applied for a loan of 1,500,000 UGX to buy agricultural produce since the season is now on.

She is widowed and has three children, with one of them currently in school. For the past 10 years, Madina has been working hard to manage her grocery shop, which sells rice, millet flour and charcoal stoves. <br \/><br \/>To help expand her business, Madina has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more items such as rice, millet flour, fruits, vegetables, and charcoal stoves to sell, and will help her to generate greater profits and improve on her family's standard of living. Madina hopes that in the future she will be able to have a brighter future. <br \/><br \/>Madina is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Madina who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1643337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Evelin is determined to be successful in every way.\n\nThe women of the Trust Bank are greatly empowered by the educational component of their monthly meetings with a Friendshp Bridge Trust Bank Officer. Their families are aided by the information that the ladies receive on nutrition, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. Their businesses grow as they learn about effective business management practices including budgeting, accounting, customer service, marketing and pricing. Their self-esteem is enhanced as they learn about women\u2019s rights. \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is what Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and loans. \n\nEvelin, along with her friends in the \u201cWomen in Action\u201d Trust Bank, shares that the group is appreciative to Kiva investors for funding their loans. They are committed to fully repaying the loans on time. We look forward to reporting on their progress. Thank you, Kiva investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1641778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She is married, and her husband works in construction. From this relationship, Raquelina has had three children, two of whom are in school. Only her husband and the kids live with Raquelina.\r\n\r\nRaquelina has a footwear business across from the market. She has had this business for six months. A friend who has a shoe store taught her the business, so she decided to set up her own shop. She travels for about 30 minutes by bus. Raquelina also has a business raising chickens in her house. Her mother taught her that business, as she had the business, but then fell ill. She still had some very small chickens, so Raquelina took care of them, and that was how she came to enjoy this business. For the last year, this has generated a quite a bit of income for her and the family.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan that she is requesting in order to buy more men's, children's, and women's footwear, because sales increase during the upcoming patron saint festivals in her area. This is going to help her because then she will generate more income and stock up the business in order to have better financial stability.\r\n\r\nRaquelina's dream is to be able to have a very big shoe store, to be able to have her own commercial space in a large house, and to give jobs to the people who need to work these days. This is her dream, to be able to give work to people and to have a very good, well-known shoe store visited by many shoppers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1642385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy more men's, children's, and women's footwear, because sales increase during the upcoming patron saint festivals in her area.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-12T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-11T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.99},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":16.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":17.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14.05,"local_amount":14.05,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":14.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009398},{"amount":30.09,"local_amount":30.09,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":30.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501428},{"amount":15.59,"local_amount":15.59,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420227},{"amount":16.03,"local_amount":16.03,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145363},{"amount":124.24,"local_amount":124.24,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":124.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611768942}],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T03:44:18Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:22:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":735467,"name":"Anna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"She is married and a mother of two children.
