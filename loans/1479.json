He grew up with his parents who instilled in him good principles and taught him the business of fast food sales, since that has been their line of work for most of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter having finished his basic education in the community school, his parents decided that the best for him would be to begin to develop his own business instead of continuing with further education. From an early age, young Franklin showed an interest in cooking while he completed his school work and household chores. He is already a very dedicated and disciplined young man, and in this way he has gotten ahead and now he runs his own business selling fast food in his community. \r\n\r\nFranklin has 5 years of experience making fast food; it is a line of work that he learned from his parents who have spent part of their lives doing this business that today has become their primary source of income. So, at age 15, he started working as a waiter in his father's business, and in a short time he learned everything necessary and believed that the kitchen no longer held any secrets for him, and in this way he began his own business with his parents' support. \r\n\r\nYoung Franklin's enterprising and passionate spirit has brought him to secure a loan that will be invested in the purchase of metal tables and a large display refrigerator, which will improve and expand his business and provide better service for his customers, which will improve his income and give him the earnings to meet his loan commitments. \r\n\r\nHis dreams and aspirations have carried him further than the rural life in which he is immersed, for this reason the goals that he has are to expand his business and set up a branch in the center of town, that has a delivery service, and among his projects will be to renew the loan to purchase a vehicle which will serve him to travel and give his employees mobility.

She will also use part of the loan to buy feed for her pigs and fertilizer to enable her crops to do well. Also she will buy piglets. She holds a positive view of this business succeeding because she has a good talent for farming; she has been doing it for a long period of time. With this business activity, the community will benefit from her moderate prices and she will share with the community the importance of GHAPE  \r\n\r\nWith the profit made from this loan, she will expand her farm size, pay her children's school fees, and save some other funds to undertake bigger investments. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals, and also, because the members are trained on marketing and management skills before the loans are

On average, they are 39 years old and have four children each. They all live in Bagadadji, one of the neighborhoods of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). These women know one another through neighborhood, kinship and marriage ties and also through their income-generating activities in the neighborhood. They prepare meals and are also involved in small retail, selling clothes and condiments.  In order to increase their businesses, they have decided to join Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, and they are on their second cycle of solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nNana (in the standing row, second from the left, in the photo) is a major seller of sweet flour and paste in and around her neighborhood. She is planning to use her loan to buy two bags of flour at the S\u00e9gou market. She sells her merchandise from home and at the market, and is paid in cash and also often on credit. Her customers are both men and women.\r\n\r\nNana is hoping to make an average monthly profit of 15,000 CFA francs, which will be used to cover some of the day-to-day needs of her children, and also to increase her own business. She wants to continue her partnership with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1644265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-07-12T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-11T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia                                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bassan                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batoma             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T16:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50223.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517677548},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50223.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530210526},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50223.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542659007},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50223.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793195},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50223.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793196},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50223.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758128}],"funded_date":"2014-07-13T16:08:49Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T15:27:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":735519,"name":"Phyllis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phyllis is a 25-year-old, single mother.

Eter was approved with the loan of 850 USD for purchasing a motorized quadrocycle and then rent it with private orders.\r\n\r\nThe family will receive an additional source of income and will more effectively meet daily expenses.

Viktorija began working with young children and discovered that she really enjoyed watching them grow and acquire new skills and knowledge every day. Eventually, Viktorija went back to school, obtaining a degree in early childhood development. She started as an assistant and continued to become a head teacher and eventually a director of a childcare center. \r\n\r\nAfter many years working in the early childhood development field, Viktorija felt that there was something missing and she could make the field better by creating quality childcare programs. In 2011, Viktorija obtained a license for her first childcare center in Valley Village, CA: A Mother Goose Academy. In 2013, an opportunity came up to take over one of the centers she had run as a director, and Viktorija obtained a license to operate the center under the name of \"A Mother Goose Academy of Chatsworth, CA\".

She's from the town of Chinandega, located in the western part of the country.\r\n\r\nJuana's a small business entrepreneur who runs her own businesses: a nice grocery store and a business buying and selling general merchandise.  Both are located in her home, where she sells to the public: rice, sugar, beans, oil, detergent, soap, snacks, firewood, frozen products, soda, juice, eggs, cigarettes, toilet paper, tomato sauce, mustard, sauces, tomatoes, onions, plantains, sardines, containers of Tang beverage and of oatmeal, pinolillo [a corn and cacao beverage], and other products.  She also sells various styles of new and used clothing, shoes, bags, cosmetics, children's outfits, plastic products, and other general merchandise.\r\n\r\nJuana is known for being a hardworking, responsible woman with a great desire for self-improvement.  She likes to spend her free time with her daughter, giving her all her attention and enjoying wonderful moments with her in various activities.  It's a pleasure for her to see a positive response from her daughter: \"This child is my reason for getting ahead every day and giving her the best.\"\r\n\r\nShe makes her purchases for the store in cash at distributors and markets in the town.

She is a native of Chinandega in the west of the country. She has always been hard-working and responsible. She has already worked with the Foundation and has a track record of paying on time. <br \/><br \/>She is a micro-entrepreneur and manager of her own business which consists of buying a variety of merchandise, selling cosmetics like cosmetic bases, body cream, facial cream, anti- wrinkle cream, make-up remover, mascara, vanity cases, Bliss products, lipstick, nail polish, shampoo, rinse, perfumes, a variety of children's and adult's clothing, shoes, sandals, amongst others. She sells them in the streets. Her daily routine is 10 hours of work from 8 am until 6 pm. The majority of her inventory is in accounts collectable as most of her work is by order with some other sales. She makes her purchases in cash in the markets and at wholesale distributors in another Department. She has both regular and casual customers. Her sales are in cash and on credit which she collects every fortnight.<br \/> <br \/>The objective of this loan is to invest in buying cosmetics like make-up, creams, shampoo, perfume, dresses, shoes, sandals, amongst others. She has had this business running for 9 years and has obtained some achievements such as having made improvements to her house and expanding the products in her business through much effort and sacrifice. One of her dreams is for her children to grow up to be good people and professionals.<br \/><br \/>Teresa is grateful for the support that the lenders at Kiva provide for small businesses so that they can have their own work to support their families.

Yobetina has always enjoyed farming and has been doing farming for the last 40 years and through these years in farming she has mastered her trade very well.<br \/><br \/>Through farming she is able to provide the basic needs of her family, which include food, clothing and education.<br \/><br \/>In order to continue making profits and supporting her large family. Yobetina is seeking a loan of KES 20,800 to buy a dairy cow to cater to the demand for milk that is in her area and customers who always demand milk. <br \/><br \/>She hopes that with the dairy cow she will be able to generate more income and comfortably support her family needs without any big challenge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1643924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Her household consists of 4 people; her three children and herself.\r\n\r\nReina worked at housekeeping since she was little because her parents abandoned her.  She went to work in other homes to earn money to buy food, clothing and medicine.  Her neighbors gave her shelter in their house so she could spend the night; but during the day, she had to work.  She found a family who gave her a job and she could also stay overnight at this house due to the the distance from where she was before.\r\n\r\nWhen she grew up, she met a man who is the father of her children, but he neglected and abandoned her to struggle with their three children.  She says that with efforts she could add a small shop which will help her to sustain her home.  She has been in business three years and to date has done very well.\r\n\r\nThe loan requested from CREDICAMPO is to buy building materials, chairs, tables to add a snack bar so she can have better income at home and to give her children a better life and to give them a future better.\r\n\r\nReina plans for their future to build a good house, because she currently has the land.

Meet Ferdinand who resides in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to some of the best elite runners that the world has ever produced. He is a hardworking farmer who has been doing farming for the past seven years. He is a family man and has one wife and two adorable kids. His primary source of income is crop farming and cattle keeping.\r\n \r\nFerdinand is a dedicated farmer whose zeal to succeed is very high. He wants to get out of the poverty that is currently bedeviling him. Poverty is one of the things that he hates most, which is why he is seeking a loan of KES 10,000 to purchase farm inputs and increase his yields on the farm.

This competition highly affects his daily sales. To increase sales and abstain from the competitors, he decided to offer some additional new, updated electric spare parts. He hopes that this strategy to upgrade his business will work positively and the customers will be attracted to his newly introduced products. He cannot act upon his strategy without some additional capital. Therefore, he has decided to request a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan.

He is married to Melanie, who works as a vendor, and they have four children. His three children are in grade school, while the youngest is not yet attending school. He and his wife are working hard to provide for their family.\r\n\r\nGlenn maintains a tricycle business. He owns and drives one unit of Tricycle (motorcycle with a sidecar) that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. He starts working early in the morning, until late in the evening. There are times when he drives in the late evening until the wee hours in order to have a bigger profit. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of Php 500 in his transportation business every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting an amount of Php 8,000 for his loan. He will be using the loan to buy motorcycle parts for the maintenance of his Tricycle unit. He has to maintain his unit in good condition in order to have a regular income for the daily needs of his family. \r\n\r\nGlenn dreams of having another unit of Tricycle, and hopes to give all his children a good life and education.

Today he is married and has 3 children, two of which are still living with him. The other is married and doesn't live with him.<br \/><br \/>Vidal is a farmer who has 2 hectares of land where he grows from April onwards. The crops he grows are corn and j\u00edcama. He learned to grow corn from his dad while he was still alive. He would take him to work on weekends. He gets two harvests year one in the winter and another in the summer. Also he gets one crop of j\u00edcama, that he seeds in July and harvests in November. His fields are two km. distance from his house. <br \/><br \/>The money from this loan will be used to buy j\u00edcama seeds and also buy inputs like manure, foliar sprays and fertilizer. This entails an expense of $1,300 but as he has a small part of that money he only needs $1,000 to cultivate the two hectares of land. <br \/><br \/>He has a dream in his life and he wants to achieve it. He wants to have a good harvest this year and get good income from his crops as he is doing two types of crops this year.
