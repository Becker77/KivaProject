Gloren has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gloren joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Gloren has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI.  This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  Gloren is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods and beverages.  This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Gloren from HSPFI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

without delinquencies.\r\n\r\nNapisa sells food products and opened her business in 2008. With the help of a starting capital of 20,000 KGS Napisa was able to develop her store business which brings about 15,000 KGS a month.

He is the sixth son among 9 brothers and sisters, and in 2004 he moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro following 4 of his siblings. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans. <P>\r\nJose completed primary school (up to 7th grade) and since 2005 is a waiter in one of Ponta D\u2019Ouro\u2019s great restaurants (Kaya Kweru). His initial salary was MTn 1,500\/ month, but since last year it was increased to MTn 2,000\/month (around US$80). He works 8 hours per day, from 7am to 3pm or from 3pm to 10pm, six days per week.<P>\r\nJose got married 2 years ago, and although his wife Cassilda (20 years old) is now working, they are barely able to save any money in the end of the month. As Jose is a very family-oriented person, he goes personally to Maputo once a month to bring his family money (MTn 1,000) and salute his mother. He pays MTn300 back and forth to Maputo, so in fact he just gives MTn 700 to his parents. <P>\r\nJose heard about Hluvuku at work, and after seeing a friend repaying his loan, he decided to apply for his first loan ever to improve his living conditions. Today Jose lives in a house with a plastic roof, and with this MTn 3,000 loan he will be able to buy aluminum roofing in South Africa and stop heavy rain from entering the house.<P>\r\nAs soon as Jose finishes repaying this first loan, he intends to apply for a second one in order to go to driver\u2019s school and get his license. The school takes 1 month and costs MTn 6,000. Jose believes that he can earn significantly more as a driver (the driver of the restaurant he works for, for example, earns 3 times more than he does). He is a very motivated young man and has many plans, such as building his own brick house and having his own restaurant.<P>\r\nThe picture shows Jose with one of his nieces, Edna, at his house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":142899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Buy construction material (aluminum roofing)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Ponta D'Ouro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-18.25 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2008-03-30T18:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Bernardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-13T18:56:55Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196155},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-05-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223900},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":252534},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-07-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281940},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-08-31T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311965},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342176},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5322551},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9941724},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-20T09:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14865334},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-03T08:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20407579}],"funded_date":"2008-03-30T18:56:55Z","paid_date":"2009-04-03T08:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":46351,"name":"Sareourn Chork Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sareourn C. is the leader of a four person loan group in Chom Teav village in Kampong Chhnang Province.

Another of her goals is for her children to continue studying until they complete their education.\r\n\r\nYasmina's business is selling general merchandise (cosmetics and clothes) and she has been doing this work for five years. She spends all the time she has on her business, and is 100% dedicated to it. She began offering cosmetics on credit in small amounts, collecting payment on the 3rd and 15th of every month. Her plan is to use this investment as capital to purchase: perfumes, creams, clothes for men and women and other things which will give her the opportunity to achieve her goals. She needs this loan as she needs to fulfil her clients' orders and she does not has enough capital to cover the demands.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Wangnime of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells flour and drinks.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

El monto que solicita ser\u00e1 cubierto en su totalidad. ","en":"Olimpia is 55 years old and lives with her 12-year-old daughter in their own home.  She sells food products native to her region, like potatoes and cheese.  Every weekend she travels to the capital city to sell her wares at various markets and also to make deliveries to customers who have placed orders.  For the past three years Olimpia has run the risk of losing her merchandise during the trip because during the rainy season there are landslides on the highway that prevent travel and food products spoil.  As this happens in the first few months of the year, she has decided to sell locally during those times.  In the future, Olimpia wants to have a grocery store, but in the meantime will continue to work as before.  This is the first time she has had a loan with MFP.  She is happy to be a member of the community bank and has promised to be an active participant in the group's development.  The money that Olimpia is requesting will go towards the purchase of more merchandise.  In this way she will increase her working capital, will buy wheels of cheese, trout and other products.  The sum that she seeks will be repaid in full.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":288935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olimpia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":172.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117259},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":172.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012181},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":172.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595762},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":172.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990029},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":172.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211162},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":170.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640669}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T20:58:07Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":99619,"name":"A\u00efssetou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is thankful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for having helped her start her business and also the many other women who wish to grow business-wise.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":387308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"She will buy fruit and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-12T17:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fidelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":333.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87075027},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":333.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990415},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":333.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835430},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":325,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":333.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727164}],"funded_date":"2009-09-13T01:45:44Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":140642,"name":"Rev.

She is 44 years old. Teresita is married and has 3 school-age children. To make a living, Teresita owns & operates a business venture raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 12000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Teresita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Teresita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

O. is 42 years old and lives in the city of Barranquilla in La Paz.  It is a commercial area in the west part of the city, it is an area that Aracelis likes because, as she says - people are aware of each other and help each other.  She has been connected with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation for 3 years with personal loans, and originally, ten years ago, she was part of a group.  She does a little of everything, has a family business where she buys fish on the Caribbean coast and later sells it in Maicao, a city on the border of Venezuela, and there she buys merchandise such as food and general supplies to sell to her customers when she returns to Barranquilla.  Since Aracelis never stays still, she has been selling chances for 15 years  and 6 years ago she added merchandise that she sold through promotional guides, these were her original businesses.  Currently Aracelis spends three hours in the mornings working at an ice cream shop near her home where she makes delicious popsicles, and later she works selling chances and her current business of food and general supplies.  She wants to add a new activity, which is providing washing services.  She wants to increase her income for her daughter when she becomes bigger.  She does not want her to have it as hard as her own life has been.  She is currently requesting a loan to be able to buy the washing machine and be able to offer the rental service and get on the road to accomplishing her dreams.  She will take advantage the customer base from her sister's store (she appears in the photo) and the knowledge that her brother has in the repair and preventative maintenance of washers.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":527689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a washer and provide rental services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-04-22T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracelis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85755},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99026},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100924},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102858},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104830},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106839},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":108887},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":110974},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113101},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115269},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":117478},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":134059}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.43},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.85},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.53,"local_amount":85755,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":86978.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895830},{"amount":51.41,"local_amount":99026,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100438.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636158},{"amount":52.41,"local_amount":100924,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":102363.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850255},{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":102858,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":104325.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117015},{"amount":54.43,"local_amount":104830,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":106325.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410884},{"amount":55.48,"local_amount":106839,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":108363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550544},{"amount":114.16,"local_amount":219861,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":222997.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688141},{"amount":58.73,"local_amount":113101,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":114714.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427388},{"amount":59.85,"local_amount":115269,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":116913.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000796},{"amount":130.6,"local_amount":251537,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":255125.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206156972}],"funded_date":"2010-04-28T08:02:10Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":198800,"name":"Merry Chill","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merry Chill C. is from the village of Bularan, Miputak.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her son helps her in the business so she just stays at home and sometimes looks out for customers to buy her products. \r\n\r\nTo further grow her business, she is requesting a loan of 12,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) to buy new clothes to sell.

She finds it hard to make ends meet with her meagre income of Rs. 9,500. She has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity. <br \/><br \/>Davamani's family of five is one of the millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Without access to a toilet, her family has to walk long distances to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. Due to this lack of sanitation facilities, the family members are at risk of infection and fall ill often, spending a significant portion of their savings on medical expenses each month. The women and daughters in her family are exposed to the additional risk of molestation. <br \/><br \/>Joining hands with two others whose families also face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, Davamani has formed a group and is hoping to address this issue. So, taking advantage of the awareness initiatives, the group now seeks a loan of Rs. 42,000 to build toilets in their homes. Your loan will provide these three families the privacy of using their own toilet, which will be a big step towards a better standard of living for them.

Only the oldest attends school.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, Assumane moved to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland, to look for work.  He worked for a few years as a guard in a residence and was able to open a booth in the central market of Namaacha. Thus, Assumane decided to leave his job and dedicate himself to his business.  Today he has three booths and sells basic products with the help of his two nephews who live with him.  He gives his nephews a monthly allowance of 500 MT. They work from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. selling the best products (including lamps, electric wire, and adhesives). They earn 6,000 MT per month.  He has not been able to save, but he already owns his own home, and has built on his land a small commercial establishment that will function as a grocery store, tended by his wife.  Besides his family, Assumane supports his mother, who lives in Nampula, sending her 1,000 MT every six months.\r\n\r\nThis is Assumane\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva.  The loan is for 11,000 MT and will be used to purchase products for his booths.  He is confident that he will be able to repay the loan before the due date.  He intends to request another loan to buy a vehicle to help with his purchases, because he spends a lot of money on transportation.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Steve Fogel, Kiva

He has worked in carpentry for twelve years.  He started his business with savings from his former job, which was in construction, a job which was exhausting but paid well.  Mr. Hugo lives in Memorial Sandino with his wife and two children, who are 12 and 14 years old and attend the local primary school.  Their plan is to try to finish the construction of their house, which is already half built out of stone.  Lumber is not very strong, so with this loan Mr. Hugo will invest in construction materials so that he can build concrete walls and be able to offer his family a dignified place to live.  This is his fourth loan from Afodenic, and the loans have greatly benefited his family because little by little they have been able to achieve their goals.

The business is going well because her small place is in a bustling area right at the foot of a busy train station used by commuters who always need a cold drink. She makes P30, 000.00 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nCornelia likes her work a lot because she meets a lot of people and she sometimes engages them in interesting conversations. She uses her earnings to cover family\u2019s expenses and she\u2019s saving so she can have a bigger \"sari-sari\" (general) store in the near future. Her small space is always a victim of frequent clearing operations done by the city hall operatives.  \r\n\r\nCornelia needs a loan of P27,000.00 to expand her business. This is her 10th loan from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative. What she likes most about her fellowship group is the level of trust and camaraderie among all the members. She will use the loan money to apply for business accreditation with a prominent telecommunications company, which will provide easier access to mobile phone credits.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

For 10 years, she and her husband have been breeding livestock and trading in sheep. Then they invested about twelve dollars to purchase cattle. This investment has turned into a monthly income, which is 10 times more than the original amount. They have raised three children. The eldest daughter, 32 and the middle son, 27, both are married and live separately. The little son, 22, is a college student. He is the only one who still lives with parents. Jumakul\u2019s husband stays at home and is busy looking after cattle, whereas Jumakul goes to the cattle market and she is the one who makes all the purchase and sale deals. They used to keep and sell sheep. Afterwards they switched to horses. Animal husbandry has appeared to be a quite profitable business for Jumakul and her husband as due to it, they have been able to give all their children a proper education and marry their daughter. In recent times, Jumakul and her husband have noticed the tendency of people to buy sheep more than they do horses, as they are cheaper. They have applied for this loan and hope that by means of this loan they will be able to invest it in purchasing and breeding sheep. They hope to increase the total population of their cattle and marry their son in the near future. \r\nJumakul has three partners: \r\nDuishokan, 44, is a mother of two children. Her husband works as a taxi-driver. Duishokan stays at home and looks after cattle. She breeds a special strain of sheep called \u201cGissar strain\u201d.  Duishokan needs a loan to purchase one more sheep of that kind. \r\nZinagul, 50, and her husband work as dentists. They have four children. Zinagul is making preparations for her son\u2019s wedding. Therefore, she has applied for this loan to buy a sheep.\r\nNestandarajan, 47, is a housewife. She keeps some cattle at home and sells milk. Her spouse is a schoolteacher. He teaches geography. Nestandarajan needs a loan to buy milk.<p><br>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Unfortunately, he lacks the financial means to satisfy these requests. He therefore decided to join Soro Yiriwaso where he has already been granted two loans, both repaid in full.\r\nWanting to satisfy an ever-increasing customer base, he is requesting a third loan to buy 30 bags of sugar peas, one ton of corn, 5 bags of millet, and 10 bags of shea nuts.\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies from villages in the vicinity of Sikasso and stockpiles them to start with at his store in the new area of M\u00e9dine in Sikasso. He then transports the products to Abidjan (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), in response to orders from factories producing sugar pea juice and shea butter. He sells grain crereals both wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nHe hopes this loan will enable him to reach monthly earnings of 315,000 FCFA, which will be used to cover most of his own expenses, those of his family and to pay the loan interest.

More and more women are forced by life conditions to sacrifice time with their children at home in order to earn money.\r\n\r\nMairambubu R., 52, is the treasurer of this group. She is married and lives with her husband and two children in the village of Kochkorka, an agricultural area with considerable trade. Her other two children already live independently and earn incomes by reselling potatoes. Mairambubu herself used to have a business, which she had to quit because of lack of capital. Now she has opened a small shop by a bus stop. She hopes this strategic location will help her gradually increase her sales. Her products mainly include drinks and snacks, which are often bought by passengers.  Mairambubu\u2019s rent payments are high, so she hopes to attract more customers and achieve more sales through attentive service and lower prices. These humble beginnings will help her secure a good life for her family members. She has already raised enough money to make her children's lives better. Mairambubu really hopes for good returns from this business and believes in success.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She is 40 years old. Flora is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Flora owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Flora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Flora joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 23,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Flora is requesting a new loan of 24000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional groceries to sell. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Flora from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":727511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional groceries to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. To learn more about IMON International's work, please visit: www.imon.tj\n\n\n","en":"Gulshan is a smart, honest and hardworking woman. She is a widow and is raising her three children alone. Gulshan has been reselling jewelry for the last 12 years and has started her business with a tiny amount of money, expanding slowly. She is raising her children on her own so it is hard for her to provide for them and she always needs support. Every morning Gulshan leaves home and comes back late at night. The money which she makes is only enough for day-to-day spending and it's hard for her to save for the future. For this reason Gulshan would like to take out a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase more jewelry in bulk and expand her business, increasing her profits and improving the living conditions for her

They have signed a contract to assure the delivery of bricks to the company's customers. This business is stable. They make about 370-400 USD a month. Her husband drives the truck all day, she's at home raising poultry. She is very busy but she always participates in TYM group meetings. This time she applies for a loan of 1200 USD to repair the truck so it does require a lot of money.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Wangnime of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells fish.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mabini, Valladolid, Negros Occidentala, is a 51-year-old woman who prays to the Lord to give her strength, good  health and long life to continue her business and help her family. Her husband is a farmer who plants different kinds of vegetables and manages their small rice farm. The couple has four adult children  between 24 and 31 years old. Glenda strives hard in her business to not only support their household needs but also to be financially independent.<p>\r\n\r\nGlenda started her business in 2002 when she joined  NWTF-Project Dungganon to borrow capital to put up a general store adjacent to her house. As soon as her first loan was granted, she bought a variety of items and products to sell, and any extra income from the store is always used to buy more goods to sell. As her loans have continued, she has also helped her husband by buying fertilizers for his vegetables and rice farm. Glenda also sells her husband's vegetable harvest in the local market and in the neighboring villages. Her business is going well, earning an average income of Php 10,000 per month.<p>\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 10,000, fully repaid without delay, was used as additional working capital for her general store.  Because of her good credit performance, she can borrow a larger amount, and this time around she is borrowing Php 15,000 for her 14th cycle loan to be utilized as revolving working capital for her general store and to purchase additional fertilizer for their vegetable and rice farm. The income from this loan will be used for house repairs. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in  the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a  life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -  a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":435454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Delia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,600 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Delia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Delia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":580258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.Aggub, Solano,Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-08-18T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":193}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":1254,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166780422},{"amount":20.9,"local_amount":836,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":950.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172048648},{"amount":26.13,"local_amount":1045,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1188.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177339371},{"amount":20.9,"local_amount":836,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":950.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182474187},{"amount":25.72,"local_amount":1029,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1170.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188610989}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T19:55:48Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T11:55:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":227510,"name":"Bonface","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bonface is 29 years old, married and a father of three.

Cubay Masville, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a coffee shop, a general store and a food vending business. Her husband, Mamerto A. Sr., who is 50 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 17 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nCorazon joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Corazon has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 9000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing 18,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more foodstuffs to sell in her coffee shop and her general store to sustain her businesses and continue to save for future home repairs and expansion of her business. Corazon A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Su principal satisfacci\u00f3n es cortar, preparar y ensamblar piezas, mediante la costura, para lograr productos de un gran acabado. De esta manera Heidy consigue olvidarse de las pocas posibilidades de empleos empresariales que existen y se dedica a producir para obtener sus ingresos y esto la hace estar muy feliz, disfrutando de lo que le gusta y especialmente por estar unidad cada d\u00eda mas a su familia.

","en":"Heidy is a very entrepreneurial young woman who lives with her parents and siblings in one of the most cheerful and indigenous neighborhoods in the city of Barranquilla.  From there, she makes pillows, bedspreads, and cushions.  Heidy belongs to a very united family, and she learned this activity from her father from the time she was 12 years old.  She remembers how at that time she began the process of understanding the enterprise and learning this noble work.  Her principal satisfaction is cutting, preparing, and assembling pieces, through sewing, in order to achieve high-quality products.  In this way, Heidy has been able to forget about the few opportunities that exist for jobs in business.  She produces in order to earn her income, and this makes her very happy.  She enjoys doing something she likes, especially because she is becoming closer with her family every day.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she will use it to improve her business' roof in order to avoid the reflection of the hot sun and the unpredictable rain.

At the same time she also sells food, a business she carries out in the evenings.  To do so, she has a table set up in her front yard where she tends to her customers.

Besides, she feels productive and independent.  She considers the latter business to be profitable because it generates more income while she can do the sewing in her free time.  Her plan is to continue with the food sales and intensify them.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP.

Their village, Ker Gu Mag, is located in the arid grasslands of central Senegal, where people depend on a mixture of subsistence agriculture and cash cropping for their livelihoods.  The loan funds will be used to purchase stocks of local grains \u2013 principally millet and corn \u2013 during the harvest season when supply is abundant and prices are low.  The grains will then be processed and sold at retail as flour and animal feed throughout the year.   \r\n\r\n<p>Background\r\n\r\n<p>Senegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group.  Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.  Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.  However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.  This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.  Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

This is 32 year old Josephine A. from Mwanza. She is married. Josephine has been running a charcoal business since 2008. She sells charcoal, which is small, black pieces of dry earth that are used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by two people. Josephine currently earns about 273USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 500USD in order to purchase charcoal stocks in bulk. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Josephine thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":347648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Their ambition is to diversify their businesses by taking up other money-earning activities such as dyeing cloth. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":459314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":" purchase of various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nagnouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-26T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152488},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991328},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-19T10:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021603},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746393},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778933}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T00:29:29Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":169599,"name":"Ernelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ernelita grew up on a farm because her parents are farmers.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Magaui joined SPBD.    This is her 6th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Magaui's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Magaui N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 37 years old, married and the father of 4 children who are 15, 10, 4 and 2 years old. The two oldest are in school. He only went to school until the 8th grade and didn't finish due to lack of financial resources.  He lives with his family in his own house and supports his mother who lives with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Chibuto to go to Boane, in the Maputo Province, to look for better living conditions. He has had his own business for more than 8 years. He is a locksmith and sells building materials. He has one helper and earns around 5.000.00mt per month, which goes towards household expenses and a savings account. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan with Novo Bank and decided not to continue for various reasons.

Three years ago, with the help of his wife, he decided to start his own business. He now provides maintenance, upkeep, and car-wash services to the buildings where he works. \r\n\r\nOscar loves being his own boss because it has given him a new freedom. He is passionate about the business and is able to send his daughters to university. He is confident that starting his own business has created a better future for his family. \r\n\r\nOscar\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/121802\" target=\"_blank\">first loan<\/a> with ACCION USA allowed him to buy equipment for his new car-wash service. Now he will use his second loan to buy lists of clients and expand his advertising capabilities. This will allow him to reach out to clients in the greater Miami area.\r\n\r\nWith a great attitude and many client referrals, Oscar is happy to report that his business is constantly growing.

Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7800,"image":{"id":575709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Lunas, Barangay Kawit, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:   food vending\/carenderia, a general store and a trisikad business. Her husband Angelito C., 32 years old, works as a carpenter & trisikad driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  \r\n\r\nThey have 6 children who are between 9 and 24 years old. Lilibeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in March, 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilibeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use to buy more food and inventory for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lilibeth C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Because of this, he commits to repaying punctually.  \r\n\r\nIf Francisco were to get support from you he will invest the requested money in the purchase of potato seeds of the \u201c\u00fanica\u201d type as well as several sacks of natural fertilizer to successfully launch his next planting cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":815127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy potato seeds and several sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-20T00:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712740}],"funded_date":"2011-07-20T02:57:07Z","paid_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":321780,"name":"Verdianne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Verdianne is 31 years old and married with three children between the ages of four and nine years old.

He has an expanse of 3 hectares ready to be harvested and others that have recently been planted.  He has 2 farm workers who help with the planting and the harvesting.  He pays them a daily wage of 20 PEN each.  Nicomedes likes his life and his work.  Thanks to his work, he is able to meet the financial needs of his business and also have an income to take care of his family's household expenses.  He loves his family very much; they are his motivation to continue working.  For now, Nicomedes wants to continue with his business and expand by planting palm oil trees.  He has seen that palm oil trees are starting to have quite a demand as an alternative crop.  This will be Nicomedes's 11th loan with MFP.  He feels grateful for the loan he has received to help him continue with his business, and he hopes to be able to continue counting on this support.

Burhan has no child yet, he plans to use his savings to fix his home in Java. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nSebagai seorang kepala rumah tangga Burhan menghidupi keluarganya sebagai Makelar sepeda motor yang pendapatannya tidak pasti, kadang-kadang sebulan bisa menghasilkan uang Rp.1.500.000 kalau sepeda motornya ada yang membeli, kadang-kadang sepeda motornya tidak laku sehingga Burhan hanya mengharapkan pendapatan istrinya yang sebagai buruh menjahit dengan upah Rp.35.000 perhari. Setelah memperoleh informasi mengenai DINARI, Burhan langsung mengajukan permohonan kredit yang rencananya akan dibelikan mesin jahit sehingga istrinya bisa menjahit dirumah sehingga pendapatannya bertambah, karena pasuh yang dijahit bisa dikerjakan dirumah dengan upah Rp.2.500 per potong pasuh. Karena istrinya bisa mengerjakan 5 \u2013 7 potong pasuh selama 4 jam sehingga pendapatannya bisa bertambah menjadi Rp,12.500. Walaupun Burhan belum mempunyai anak, semua pendapatannya rencananya digunakan untuk memperbaiki tempat tinggalnya yang ada di Jawa."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":62087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of new Sewing Machine for His Wife's Seamstress Business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-08T01:45:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burhan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-22T02:43:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2007-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2007-09-26T06:29:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58586},{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T02:56:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68294},{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T03:40:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85233},{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T08:48:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105279},{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T03:01:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124094},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-03-01T07:39:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145952},{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T08:04:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195751},{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T01:22:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225206},{"amount":23,"local_amount":23,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T01:25:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259320},{"amount":14,"local_amount":14,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303468},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334292}],"funded_date":"2007-09-08T02:43:17Z","paid_date":"2008-09-29T07:20:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":21835,"name":"Ana Baudilia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Hello, my name is Ana Baudilia and I have been working in a small grocery store situated in my home for three years.

During 2001, she had courageously joined YTM to request for a business development loan.  Everyday, she brings eggs from her farm to sell in the Ni-Trung Gia market, earning about 2.5 to 3 USD of profit.  She also encourages her husband to learn the welding trade and used half of the last loan to open up a store and buy raw materials for him to produce buckets and basins.  Because of that, she had met no difficulties in the last loan payments and this time around, she would like to ask for a loan of 1200 USD to buy poultry eggs and corrugated iron and expand her business.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the market. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2009, Agnes joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\n\nAbout GDMPC:\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":448814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

He is 59 years old, married, and has 12 children. Nine of them are already adults and the 3 younger children, who are 16, 14 and 11 years old, are in school.  Salvador only finished 4th grade. He didn't continue because at the time he didn't have access to further schooling. He lives in his own house with his family, and also takes care of two relatives who live with him.\r\n\r\nSalvador never left Boane. He works as a driver for a private corporation. He doesn't have anyone working for him and brings home a monthly salary of 4900 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nSalvador has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is his 4th loan, for the amount of 12,200 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, stones, nails, sand and other items) in order to continue work on his construction project. His earlier loans were for 9600, 11,000 and 13,000 Meticales, and all were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to get more loans in order to finish his house, to offer better living conditions for his family. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She lives in Brgy. Babajuba Junob, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\n By working hard in her frozen foods business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,500.  Anna is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she  can continue to fund the operations of her frozen foods business.   This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Anna aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She runs a retail business in Nkandla, South Africa (KZN). In the photo she is pictured raising her hand.\r\n\r\nHawukelaphi has been in the business of selling fruits and vegetables at town shelters for 10 years. She also earns income from the government\u2019s child support grant. She says that the main challenge to her business is facing rainy and cold weather when she sells, because the shelter she usually sells in is an open shelter.

This business requires a lot of dedication because it  takes a lot of effort to carry out the breeding.  Dedication is necessary because the work requires strict control of every animal and at the same time feeding and caring for those that are older.\r\n\r\nThrough this business, Nematullo is able to support his spouse and his 5 children.   He is soliciting a loan through IMON International to buy more animals, which he will raise and sell in the market. Nematullo has gained a reputation for being responsible with his financial obligations and for keeping his word. We are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

she now lives. She was born and raised in the middle income class family and after graduating from school she got married and gave birth to her first son in 1986. To provide for her family with all the necessary things she had to work very hard.\r\n\r\nRight now she has three children - a daughter and two sons. Her youngest son and daughter go to school. In 2004 Mavluda decided to start her own business in the trade of consumer goods. When she began her business with a starting capital of 20,000 soms (KGS) she was able to develop her business and to this day her monthly profit is around 10,000 soms.\r\n\r\nMavluda's small trade pavilion with a size of two by three meters is very popular due to a good variety of products offered, but unfortunately it does not allow to increase the volume of sales. This is why Mavluda decided to come to Bai Tushum and Partners to ask for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to increase the variety of her products. She plans to invest the profit in purchasing of another pavilion on the local market.\r\n\r\nZAO MFK Bai Tushum & Partners provides loans through Kiva for socially vulnerable population regions.
