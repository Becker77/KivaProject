She is the mother of four children, three of whom are grown and already live with their own families. She married her husband six years ago. She lives in her home with him and her youngest child, who is five years old. \r\n\r\nShe grew up with her mother and one brother, who really struggled to get ahead, because she had to work all day to support her family. She studied up to ninth grade and she didn't continue because she didn't have her mother's support, because she had to go to work days for the family's sustenance. \r\n \r\nBlanca has devoted her time to selling tortillas since she was little. At that time, she worked beside her mother in the community where they obtained their financial income. Currently, she is still working and selling tortillas, but her mother is no longer working because she is elderly. Previously, she worked as a housekeeper for someone in the community. \r\n\r\nThese days, her husband helps her by delivering the tortillas to the homes that have ordered them, and he also works in farming and in other activities in order to improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nBlanca is requesting a loan from Credicampo, to buy 15 quintales (1,500 lbs) of corn, firewood, and at the same time buy a gas stove, because she has such high demand.\r\n \r\nBlanca dreams every day about growing her tortilla business. Every day she saves some of her profits towards a small, more stable locale where she can have her business and increase production, because there is high demand in the community. She also hopes to help her youngest son study so she can see him become a professional in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1642979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy 15 quintales of corn, firewood and at the same time buy a gas stove, because she has such high demand.

Money aside, at 50 years old, she still is passionate about her job of 14 years as a certified Spanish teacher. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is continuing her studies, because she wants to impart greater knowledge to her students. She is taking postgraduate courses for her Master's degree every Saturday at the UNIVAL. \r\n \r\nCecilia is single and has no children, however she does have one dependent. She has the support of her mother and her siblings, as well as the economic support of the bonds offered by the Ministry of Education. Previously, she obtained a Master's degree in Communication Science, with an emphasis in Teaching at the UNAN, but her desire to continue forging her future did not end there. At this time, she needs a loan to pay the expenses of the postgraduate and Master's degree, for which she is studying.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to open her own book store, but before that, she wants to concentrate on this important stage in her life, since she is growing professionally and intellectually.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":520.78,"image":{"id":1642762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for the expenses of postgraduate and master's studies.

His wife does the household chores and during the coffee harvest season helps him with the family income when he is carrying out this work.\r\n\r\nThey have two children, a boy of 16 who attends the local high school and a daughter is who was 10 years old and died due to an illness that led to her death when she was only 10. Only Inmer, his wife and their son live in their home.\r\n\r\nHe has farmed since he was a child, and learned this work from his father who was a person devoted to his family and to working hard for their sake. Inmer has followed in his father's footsteps by being a person very devoted to his family and to working for them. He feels that with his work he gives his family what they need, by bringing them food. With a great deal of effort but with love, he is helping his son receive an education, as he wants him to be a person of worth in the community. \r\n\r\nIn his work the hours vary a great deal, as he has to work in the morning as a day laborer to be able to provide money for his family. In the afternoon, he cultivates the land in order to feed his household. So for him, practically the entire day is work. On weekends or when he has no classes, his son helps him with the work so that he can finish sooner.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan he will pay for the rent on the land where he grows corn and beans. He will also buy manures, herbicides and insecticides to apply to his crops at the time they need it. This is in order to ensure a good production of basic staples. By buying all these products he will be assured of applying them to his crops on time. \r\n\r\nHe has many dreams, but the main one is for his son to study everything that he was not able to, and that he graduate with a university degree so that he will have a better standard of living. He hopes that his efforts will be well rewarded by his son and also wishes to see his house be larger and built with more resistant materials."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1642973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay the rent on the land where he grows corn and beans.

She grew up watching her parents, entrepreneurs themselves, in Ghana cook for their clients. Following in their footsteps, Nuuruyatu moved to the United States five years ago to start her own enterprise. \r\n\r\nWith only $50, Nurruyatu began making Kenkey, a fermented cornmeal dish popular in parts of West Africa, out of her own kitchen.  She turned to her family and friends to test out the flavors. Once perfected, she moved operations to a commercially licensed kitchen. Her business, Kadosh Foods Enterprise, makes Kenkey, Shito (a hot black pepper sauce found in Ghana), fried fish, and shrimp. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, rent for the incubator space was expensive. So, the next year, Nurruyatu moved into her own space, allowing her to produce and ship\/cater her food to other restaurants, markets, or events.  After investing her money into the new space, she\u2019s now ready to improve the quality of her food products. With this loan, Nuuruyatu will be able to improve the packaging of her products, increasing the quality and appeal. \r\n\r\nHelp this self-made female entrepreneur grow her

This idea came up when she and her husband both realized that in their community people were having to go a distance of 2 kilometers to buy their products.  So it was then that she started buying products to sell, and her business was growing.  In addition to this business, she has 2 dairy cows that are very useful to her, because with their milk she makes milk curd, cheese and cream to sell.\r\n\r\nAna will invest this loan in the purchase of 2 more cows, valued at $900 each.  Thus, she will invest a total sum of $1,800 in the two cows.  She will also use a small amount of her personal savings for this investment.  These cows will improve and expand her milk production so that she will be able to increase her sales.\r\n\r\nIn the short run, Ana plans to buy a cream processor to improve the quality of her cream, and she will also open up a dairy shop in the center of her town, because there is no such shop, and there is a large population of people.  She knows that with the help of this loan, she will gradually achieve her goals.  This way, she will pay of her loan and also have greater profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1642950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 2 dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-13T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-12T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Lorenza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482368}],"funded_date":"2014-07-28T04:44:45Z","paid_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":736258,"name":"Son","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Son, 61 years old, lives in a remote area of Batheay District, Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Hilda wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan amounting to 15,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. She is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nHilda hopes that her business will last longer and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

She is 34 years of age and blessed with three children. Nilda Helen's family is one of the affected by super typhoon Haiyan which swept through the Philippines last November 8, 2013. She has restarted her business and is committed to regain what they lost. Her husband, Generoso, helps her in their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Nilda Helen wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan amounting to 22,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nNilda Helen aspires to save enough money so they can avail their dream house and lot. She also dreams to send all her children to college. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

As a way of generating income, he has engaged in a variety store business within his community in Coron Palawan, Philippines, for more than 10 years now. Jonathan\u2019s family is one of the ones affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan, which swept through the Philippines last November 8, 2013. He has restarted his business and is committed to regain what they lost. He works hard to provide for the everyday needs of his family.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Jonathan wants to make his business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, he would like to avail a loan amounting to 20,000 PHP to buy additional grocery items that are needed. He is hoping that he will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nJonathan hopes that his business will become bigger and better. He also desires to help his parents, who are supporting him and are taking good care of his children. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week, and this is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1644508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Roland's family is one of the affected by super typhoon Haiyan which swept through the Philippines last November 8, 2013. He has restarted his business and is committed to regain what they lost.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Roland wants to make his business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, he would like to request a loan amounting to 50,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. He is hoping that he will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nRoland hopes to expand and open another branch for his business so that he could give the best for the education of his children. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She also sells squash, citrus fruits and other Filipino fruit staples. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day. \r\n\r\nMarlene is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan to purchase more varieties of fruit and vegetable to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAside from becoming successful in business and future plans, Marlene also hopes to make life easy for her children and grandchildren and give them a better and quality education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

exhibitors at local gem fairs. Consumed by this lifelong love affair with jewelry and design, she decided to pursue a degree in jewelry and metalworking first at Mesa Community College in 2009 and then later from the San Diego State School of Art and Design. \r\n\r\nCassandra credits her time spent in school as integral in allowing her to find her own voice and style in jewelry design. She also took classes in entrepreneurship and portfolio creation, which helped her channel her distinctive point of view into her handmade jewelry. \r\n\r\nThe feeling one gets from her work is exemplified by the name of her business: Lux Amor Pax, which means \u201clight, love, peace\u201d in Latin.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery piece I make is created with the intention of bringing light, love and peace to the wearer and everyone the wearer comes in contact with,\u201d Cassandra said.\r\n\r\nEvery time she sees a stranger walking down the street wearing one of her pieces, Cassandra is filled with joy and satisfaction, and reaffirmed in her mission to provide quality jewelry to her customers.\r\n\r\nCassandra will use her Kiva loan to buy tools and equipment, which will allow her to diversify the pieces she is able to offer to customers. \r\n\r\nCheck out her pieces at:

He is interested in offering more variety to his customers, which will help him to increase his net income and savings. However, due to lack of money, he finds it difficult. Therefore his wife, Azra, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband purchase a variety of fruits from the field and sell them in the market at a profitable price.

When she was a young girl, she started working to help her parents financially.  She did domestic work in Guayaquil, Quito, and cities where she could find work.  \r\n\r\nLucia lives with four of her eight children, who appreciate all of her sacrifice by attending classes.  Two of her children are in Colombia serving in the military.  Her two daughters study and work in Guayaquil.  She does not have a partner and she is very happy to see her children grow up.  \r\n\r\nShe used to sell clothing, and many people would take the merchandise on credit and not pay.  She currently has a small business selling food outside of a high school.  She prepares a variety of items in her home and sells them during school breaks.  \r\n\r\nLucia will use this loan to purchase a larger stove, eight seats, two tables, and two umbrellas to improve the comfort of her diners.  \r\n\r\nLucia does not own her own home and pays rent.  She hopes that she will be able to purchase a home soon so that her children have comfortable space in her home.  She is sure that her business will grow and she will be able to make her loan

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of two children. Her husband is a trained gardener by profession. He provides services in gardening to different areas. He trembles the plants, waters them and decorates them in good looking shapes by using different gardening tools such as a trowel, a watering can, a transplanting spade, a fork, and an edger. He is very hardworking and expert in the gardening field. People in society call him for gardening services at their houses. He wants to buy some new tools such as a trowel, a watering can, a transplanting spade, a fork, an edger etc for gardening work. He also wants to buy some new plants for gardening work. Therefore, Maria has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband so that he is able to buy gardening tools and more plants. This will help him to continue his services well. Maria is so much thankful to Kiva and BRAC

She earns a minimum of 500 pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nEulalia plans to cook and sell other delicacies, but she doesn't have enough capital. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan amounting to 10,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional raw products like pork and chicken and seasonings that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nEulalia dreams to have her own restaurant in the future, and she hopes that her business will last longer. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1644556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken and vegetables and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-14T03:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-13T03:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3623.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517256},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2898.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000216},{"amount":83.31,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3623.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491738},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":724.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561624929}],"funded_date":"2014-07-14T12:30:29Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":736293,"name":"Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Lilia works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a restaurant business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a general store.

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Evelyn would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 50,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Evelyn hopes to expand her business and to become successful in all that she is pursuing in life.

Her husband, Rodolfo, helps her in their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Aida wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like the help of a loan amounting to 8,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nAida hopes to stay strong and fit for work so that she could continually help to sustain their everyday needs. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is in a relationship and is the mother of two children, although they are not from her current relationship since she has only lived with him for a year. Her current partner has made a living enlisted in military service for 4 years. Ana\u2019s children go to school. She is engaged in homemaking and serving customers in the house. She has a small store that she opened owing to that they have bought the house where they live recently and in the previous place there was a store. The people in the area were always asking what was happening with the store and that was how she decided to try to open it. Before this she worked in a funeral home.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to purchase products for the store (chicken, oil, cuajada cheese, churros, sweets, rice, sugar, etc.). She purchases the products in the town from where she travels by car and from where she leaves the car. She transports the things on foot by walking some 10 minutes.

He has earned an income through a variety store business within his community in Coron Palawan, Philippines for ten years. He and his wife work hard to provide for the everyday needs of their family. Ronnie\u2019s family was affected by super typhoon Haiyan which swept through the Philippines last November 8, 2013. He has restarted his business and is committed to regain what they lost.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to limited funds, Ronnie wants to make his business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, he would like to borrow 50,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. He is hoping that he will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nRonnie hopes to expand his business and to send his children to school and provide them with a better future. He meets weekly with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

planning to in the near future. She has a secondary education and plants crops and raises livestock with her husband as the family's main source of income. She started farming 5 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Aiperi now has one calf and ten sheep and earns 5,000 som (KGS) per month.

","en":"Fatima is 60 years old and married. All of her children are self-sufficient and live independently. Fatima has a secondary education. For many years, she worked in a hospital. Since 2002, Fatima has been practicing agriculture and raising cattle, but she primarily practices crop farming. She has 6 cows, 20 sheep and 2 horses on her farm, as well as a 3.0 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows beans, potatoes and perennial grasses. She sells her crops to wholesale distributors. She also sells milk to local residents. Fatima is known as a principled, honest, respectable and dependable person. Currently, Fatima's business brings in a monthly profit of 6,500 som (KGS). For the further development of her farm, Fatima turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS). The loan enables her to purchase mineral fertilizers and till her land. Fatima plans to use the earnings from the loan to develop her farm. She is also determined to renovate her home in the

She is a widow and the mother of three. For many years, Kuluypa has been growing farm produce, having started all the way back in 1980. Thanks to Kuluypa\u2019s hard work, at present she earns a revenue of 15,000 KGS per month from selling her produce. Her farm relies exclusively on manual labor. At her land plot of 1.018 ha [2.5 acres], Kulypa grows tomatoes and watermelons; in the fall, she also sells walnuts. In order to develop her business further, Kuluypa has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 80,000 KGS to buy mineral fertilizers for treating her land. Kuluypa plans to obtain a good harvest and increase her revenue from selling farm produce; she also will spend part of the money to buy livestock. Kuluypa plans to invest her resulting revenues into a new diner. She has been planning to go into the restaurant business for some time now, especially since she grows her own produce. Kulypa believes that this business will bring excellent revenues.

\u201cCamp\u201d, located in the rural community of Momostenango in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. The group is composed of ten dynamic women who are committed to leaving poverty behind and leading empowered lives. The ladies have successfully completed paying off their previous loans funded by Kiva investors last September.  The women report that the loans have been a great boost to their businesses (agricultural endeavours, animal husbandry and the production of handicrafts). They are requesting a new loan that is especially important now that there are three new members in the Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nCalixta was our featured client back last September. She reports that because of her loan, she was able to purchase a few pigs and dozens of chickens and turkeys as well as food to fatten them up quickly. She has been able to put aside to some funds to take care of her family. \r\n\r\nMaria is another member of the Trust Bank with seven children who range in age from four to fifteen. She is 37 years old and raises chickens, turkeys and pigs. In addition, she is a talented textile artist and embroiders beautiful blouses. Maria is requesting her first loan and will use the funds to purchase chickens, another pig and feed for them. She also needs to buy more supplies  including thread and fabrics for her embroidery business. Her ultimate goal is for her children to be educated and she is pleased that five of them are in school.\r\n\r\nBusiness and personal tools are essential to ensure the success of Maria, Calixta and the other ladies in the Trust Bank. Friendship Bridge understands this and has combined the loans with education for the women. The concept is called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. Each month, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares timely information with the ladies about how to effectively manage their businesses (accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing, pricing indebtedness), how to take care of themselves and their families (hygiene, nutrition, health, the use of medicinal plants) as well as women\u2019s rights and self esteem.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank \u201cCampamento\u201d feels proud to belong to the Friendship Bridge\/Kiva alliance. They are grateful for the confidence of each Kiva investor in funding their loans. We shall report to you on their progress in the very near future. Thank you, Kiva investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5175,"image":{"id":1644260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

western highlands of Guatemala. Eight women, who have a vision of eliminating poverty and leading empowered lives, have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Solidarias de Chucam\u201d. The ladies are involved in textile and handicraft businesses.\r\n\r\nElsa, a young 26-year-old woman, is the Treasurer of the Trust Bank. She has had seven years of formal education, but because of the lack of funds, she was unable to complete her schooling. However, Elsa is very aware of the importance of education, and wants her little daughter to receive a good one. \r\n\r\nShe works hard in her textile business, where she creates beautiful, typical blouses and purses that enjoy great demand. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Elsa is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge, along with the other women in the Trust Bank. \r\n\r\nShe will use her loan to purchase fabric, zippers, thread, needles and other supplies for her textile business. Elsa looks forward to selling her increased inventory at an Artesan\u2019s Market near her community. Many tourists attend the market, and Elsa wants to have lots of inventory for them to choose from.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank acquire additional tools to improve their personal and business lives from the educational components of their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares useful and timely information about effective business management practices (budgeting, accounting, customer service, over-indedtedness) as well as health, hygiene and nutrition. The ladies also learn about self-esteem, women\u2019s rights and violence against women. \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is the name that Friendship Bridge gives to this combination, and it is one that truly works.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the hard-working and motivated women in the Trust Bank, Elsa thanks Kiva investors for believing in them and funding their loans. They are committed to working diligently and keep their goals in sight! Thank you, Kiva investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":1645026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To
