Born in the province Campero, she's a single mother. She has one dependent child. Currently she lives in her parents' house in the tropics of Cochabamba. She has a primary school level of education, since her parents' scarce resources didn't help her to continue studying.

He is 50 years old and married to Luningning. He has three children who are currently in school. He catches and sells fresh fish to provide for the everyday needs and expenditures of the family. Judie \u2019s family is one of those affected by super typhoon Haiyan, which swept through the Philippines last November 8, 2013. He has restarted his business operation and is committed to regain what they lost.\r\n\r\nFishing is one of the common sources of income in the Philippines since most of the folks live near the seashore. Among them is Judie. First thing in the morning, he prepares his fishing tools and accessories like nets, rod holders, bait prep and tanks, grippers, knives and more. After hours of bearing the scorching heat of the sun, he will go back to the shore with other fishers with their nets full of tons of fresh-caught fish. There are many patrons who prefer his products since they are assured of freshness and cleanliness. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nJudie needs to add more tools and equipment for fishing. That is why he is taking out PHP 10,000 loan assistance to continue operating his business. He will be utilizing the loan to improve his service and to be able to catch more fish which are necessary to increase his profit.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wants to have more boats for fishing.  He also hopes to improve their general living condition. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n *All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1645187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":["Disaster

Phares has been practicing farming for the last 15 years on his small plot, where he does mixed farming.\r\n\r\nPhares enjoys farming so much, and every day he wakes up to go to the farm and improve his life. Through farming, he has been able to take care of his large family and provide the basic needs to them. \r\n\r\nHaving the traits of a go-getter, Phares has always dreamt big. He has a vision of owning a large cereal-selling shop. That is why he is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to start a cereal-selling shop and make his dream come true. With your loan, Phares will be able to improve his income levels and be able to comfortably take care of his family.\r\n\r\nPhares' projections are that by the end of the first year he would be able to start another cereal-selling shop, which means more income and improved living conditions. \r\n\r\nThrough the profits generated from the business, he would be able to pay the loan and provide a secure future for his children and wife."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1644900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-14T18:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-13T18:30:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phares","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2221.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2304.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2343.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2425.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2472.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2538.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2643.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2678.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2758.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2825.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2903.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.27,"local_amount":4480.29,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4594.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054351},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":2379.02,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2439.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547539},{"amount":26.79,"local_amount":2296.14,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680520},{"amount":29.08,"local_amount":2492.79,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2556.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624805},{"amount":29.79,"local_amount":2553.44,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2618.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193878},{"amount":184.31,"local_amount":15798.32,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":16200.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823355}],"funded_date":"2014-08-01T06:00:35Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":736722,"name":"Clarita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarita is 58 years old and married.

Nurzhan has a secondary-specialized education. She worked for many years as an elementary school teacher. Since 1997, she has been running her own small farm where she practices livestock breeding. She currently has 1 cow, 1 bull calf, 5 sheep and 1 heifer on her farm. She also has a 1.75 hectare plot of land sown with barley. Good family ties produce good results. Specifically, her farm brings in an average monthly income of 8,500 som (KGS), primarily from the sale of milk and dairy products to local residents. There is a big demand for delicious home-cultivated milk which is why Nurzhan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a dairy cow. Nurzhan plans to use the earnings from the loan to increase the size of her herd. She is also determined to save money for her daughter's

Mahulpada village is remotely located and rural. In this village there is a separate hamlet for the Mahar community. The main source of livelihood for this community is weaving bamboo baskets. In the year 2014, 15 poor, illiterate rural women of this hamlet formed a Self Help Group named Jay Ram with an objective of taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the overall development of their families with the improvement of their existing business. Basant, age 45, is one of the members who is sitting in the middle with her hand raised. She is married and resides in a small hut with her four-member family comprised of her husband, one son age 17 and one daughter age 12 who are continuing their studies. All members of this group have a very poor background with a lack of all basic needs like education, shelter, health facilities etc.  \r\n\r\nThe business of Basant is a traditional business of their community (weaving of bamboo baskets). Basant and her husband combined do the processing work and knit baskets of different varieties. They sell their products in the nearest weekly market of the town. Some traders also regularly come to this village to purchase bamboo products. Basant earns a monthly profit of Rs 4,000 from her business. This small income is not at all sufficient for her to manage the household expenses as well as the educational expenses of her children. As there is a growing demand for these products to supply to various parts of the country, Basant wants to purchase more raw bamboo with this loan of 14,000 INR to work for a longer period. This will help her to earn some extra income to manage the family smoothly. Basant hopes to construct a house in the near future and give a higher education to her son and daughter.\r\n\r\nThe other 14 members of the group also do the same business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1645023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more raw bamboo.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Mahulpada,Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-14T18:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-13T18:40:05Z","loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basant","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balmati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuntala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baidehi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Udia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tarulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nalini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rebati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrakala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":202000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":202000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T10:27:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":736729,"name":"Aitasi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aitasi is a 41-year-old divorced woman with one child. \r\n\r\nShe runs a small fishing business in her community to earn a living.

grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and in their personal, household, and business expenditures. She also sells Intra vitamins for additional income.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 17,000 PHP loan to buy Intra products like multivitamins for her business. She will also use her loan to buy grocery items for her variety store. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRuth dreams that her business will grow bigger and be well established. She hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Microfinance loans.

She is married and blessed with six children. Currently, three of them are still relying on her and one is in school. To overcome her financial burden, she grows rice on three hectares of farmland and has a paid working job for supplementary income. She has been involved in this business for 20 years and it has earned her a decent income to feed the family. This is not the first cycle loan for her with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has fully repaid her past loans successfully and they have enabled her to provide sufficient meals for her kids. Now, she leads a group of two to request a loan. As the leader, she will spend her entire loan portion to buy fertilizer and rice seeds and to pay for plowing fees. She strongly hopes to gain a better crop yield and to upgrade her standard of living.

57 years old and has a son. Since 2009, Aitbyubi has been working in retail. She sells dairy products (kurut or dried sour cream, suzmo or sour cottage cheese, and clarified butter) and honey at the city's central market. Thanks to her hard work, her sales volume has increased to 80,000 som (KGS) - that is 4 barrels of honey, 100 liters of clarified butter, and 100 kilograms of kurut. Her average monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Aytbyubi turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to procure dairy products and honey for future retail sale. There is always a large demand for her all-natural merchandise. Aytbyubi plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further development of her business.

Madina is a talented seamstress and gradually her number of customers has increased. Madina's mother works for a Tajik Certification and Regulatory Compliance Agency. Her younger brother, Dodojon, is 19 years old. He attends Tajik State University of Politics and Business, which is located in the city of Khujand.  He is a first-year student in the Economics Department. He wants to receive a university education and land a job in his field of study in order to improve the financial situation of his family.

underdeveloped region of Odisha state. The main source of income of the people of this village is from cultivation and micro enterprises. \r\n\r\nTilottama, a lady of 23 years, lives here with her husband and one daughter of 3 years in a small mud house. She is third from right with her hand raised in the photograph. Her family belongs to the below poverty line category. Tilottama, with the help of her husband, has been running a general store in her house for the last 5 years, selling varieties of items like potatoes, oil, rice, dough, soap, sugar, tea, washing powder, lentils, biscuits, toffees, eggs, stationery items, and mobile recharge vouchers. Initially she started this business with a small investment of her own. She purchases stock for her business thrice a week from the wholesale sellers of the nearest town, which is 15 kms away. Due to a lack of sufficient money, she has to purchase items on a regular basis, which unnecessarily increases costs in both finance and labor. From her business, she earns a monthly income of 5,000 Indian rupees (INR), on which it is very hard for her to manage her family. \r\n\r\nTo expand her business for more income in the year 2014, Tilottama, along with other ten women of her village, formed a self help group named Jagadamba to receive a loan from the Mahashakti foundation. She wants to increase stock of products for her business from her portion of the loan in the amount of 14,000 INR by purchasing items like potato, lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. Tilottama hopes this will help her to increase her income for materializing her dreams of construction of a house, a toilet and better education of her daughter.\r\n\t\r\nThe other ten borrowers of the group are doing micro enterprises such as fast food centers, dry food and spices businesses, puffed rice selling, rice selling, daily needs shop, general store, bold gram fry and selling, etc."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1645258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing potato, lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TETELKHUNTI, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-14T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-13T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tilottama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sujeshta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nalini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monarama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subhakesi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Haripriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Madana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anupama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tapaswini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T20:47:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":736806,"name":"Leny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leny is 40 years old and married, with two children who are in school.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

Eva makes her home here. She is separated but has seven adult children who have left home, although one daughter still lives with her. Sra. Eva has always worked hard in order to get on in life. She sells all types of clothing, perfume, deodorants etc. from her house as well as in the community to neighbours and acquaintances. She sells the items on credit and then collects money each week.

She is married and lives with her husband who is dedicated to metal structure work in their home. She tells us that she finished fourth grade since her parents did not have sufficient money to pay for her education and she could not prepare herself professionally. For this reason, Vilma does not want her children to experience the same that happened to her so she sent her daughters to school and wishes her children to become professionals in the future.\r\n\r\nVilma is dedicated to domestic work and takes care of her children and her husband at home. When she was not yet married, she worked in a shoe factory since she had no obligations. However today, since she is married and has children, she sees life with more responsibility. The only activity that generates income for her is selling catalog products so she sees it as a form of working and, even better, it does not take up much of her time.\r\n\r\nThe loan investment will be for the remodeling of her house since during the rainy season her family is harmed since some of their belongings get wet. Specifically, she will build two rooms for her daughters since they need privacy. She will buy 1000 blocks, 20 bags of cement, 3 quintals of irons and workers. Thanks to this project, her children will live more comfortably, more securely and without danger of getting wet when it rains.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she has many plans and desires for herself and her family. She tells us that in first place is to be at peace with God, to keep remodeling and building her house, that her daughters study a lot unlike her since her parents could not give her the opportunity to study and also, she would like to be able to make pastries thanks to a course she took. She wishes to start her own pastry shop since it is a project that she wishes to start with the help of a new

Manta is known for being a city of unsurpassed beauty with many tourist attractions. \r\n\r\nAngela, 63, lives here in Manta. She is separated and has eight grown children. Three of them live with her. \r\n\r\nAngela is a woman who, despite her age, likes to work and get by independently. In the morning, she sells newspapers and magazines in a small stall in the city center. In the evenings and into the night, she coverts a room of her home into a small restaurant where she sells sausage soup and sausages accompanied by grilled green plantains that delight her customers. She also prepares snacks in the food business. One of her daughters helps her and Angela pays her for her work. She has had her restaurant for 10 years and has always done well as her customers prefer it after they try her dishes. \r\nHer loan will be used to buy rice, meat, sausages, and other food for her to prepare. She has been involved in this credit group for over 13 years and likes it because one of her loans started this business. Her goals are to continue getting ahead.

The people are very friendly and hardworking. This canton is the destination for many tourists as they have many inns where you can relax and be treated with a lot of kindness.\r\nLuis lives and has a business in this canton. He is a hard worker who has a strong relationship with his partner. They have 3 children. The oldest is eight and the youngest is 2. His wife does not work, she stays in the home looking after their children. They come from poor families with low economic resources which made it impossible to continue in school. They only have a primary school education.\r\nIn his childhood and adolescence, he learned this business from his brothers.

She extends her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Crispa hopes to become free from all her debts. She also dreams that her children will have a better future.

An amount of PHP 15,000 could help her in the renovation and beautification of their place, so that they could attract more boarders. She will also utilize the loan for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance, in advance.\r\n\r\nEster hopes to become successful and hopes for a longer and healthier life of her family. She meets weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. She draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1527519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the repair and maintenance of her rental property.

India formed a group named Baba Dhabaleswar to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their businesses. Prabhasini, a simple but confident lady, is one of them. She hails from a middle class family. The lady standing at the extreme right and raising her hand in the photo is Prabhasini. She is 34 years old and lives with her husband and two sons, aged 10 and 5 years. Both of her children are continuing their study in schools.\r\n\r\nPrabhasini has been running a press paper plate-making unit in her house for the last ten years with the help and support of her husband. Now, she has four leaf-plate pressing machines. She has engaged three workers to manage her business. She supplies her products to the retailers of the same town and other towns in a 20-mile radius. She purchases raw materials such as paper and polythene from the nearest wholesale market of 200 kilometers away on a monthly basis.  \r\n\r\nShe gets a monthly income of 10,000 INR from the above business. Out of this income, she hardly is able to manage her household and business expenses. Due to the quality of her product and the timely delivery, the demand for her unit is growing day by day. But to meet the demands of the customers, finance was a problem for her. So, she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nWith the present loan, Prabhasini has planned to purchase bulk paper and purchase a press machine for making plastic glasses. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as well as attract more customers. Prabhasini hopes to save enough for the extension of her existing house and better education for her sons. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Sujata, Chandrama and Bhumi, who are running a general store, a tent house, and a groundnut vending business respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1645343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase bulk paper and a press machine for making plastic glasses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T01:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T01:10:04Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chandrama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prabhasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sujata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":52000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-15T12:24:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":736892,"name":"Trinath-A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trinath-A is a Joint Liability Group formed in the year 2014 by five active women entrepreneurs from Titilagarh town in the Bolangir district in Odisha, India to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing business.

The profits she earns will be used to educate her children and buy her own land.  \r\n\r\nCecilia hopes to build more classrooms up to the standard eight level to accommodate all the pupils, and improve the lives of the children in her community.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1645440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"To add to her savings to build classrooms ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nakuru","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.283333 36.066667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T01:40:05Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-02T09:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1827.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517702886},{"amount":18.48,"local_amount":1478,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-19T10:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1620.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530253246},{"amount":23.2,"local_amount":1856,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-20T09:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2034.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":543427599},{"amount":21.07,"local_amount":1685.5,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1847.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579801526},{"amount":21.09,"local_amount":1687.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1849.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595346538},{"amount":20.32,"local_amount":1626,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-27T09:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1782.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624422083}],"funded_date":"2014-07-15T06:46:50Z","paid_date":"2015-03-27T09:56:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":736911,"name":"Jalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jalia is a female Ugandan mother of two children living in Masindi-Uganda.

Patrick appreciates UGAFODE and Kiva lenders for their financial support, which has enabled him to educate his children and sustain his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1645507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cows for trade","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T05:20:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530923209},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676581},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561810190},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579786488},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595336119},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611969935},{"amount":40,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624410416},{"amount":38.87,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.13,"payment_id":636758746},{"amount":38.97,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-25T12:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":651654720},{"amount":35.38,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-26T12:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106278.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.62,"payment_id":668715887}],"funded_date":"2014-08-03T00:01:26Z","paid_date":"2015-06-26T12:11:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":736968,"name":"Fitnete","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fitnete is a married mother of six children.

her work continues to be a positive influence in this community. Frances is a Pediatric Occupational Therapist and needs to work out of her home to support herself and to comfortably assist her young patients, ranging from 0 \u2013 18 years of age. Her struggle began when she tried to save her childhood home after her parents suddenly passed in 1996. At that time, she was also caring for her aunt, who also eventually passed. As a result of her having to care for family members and the subsequent losses, Frances found herself struggling not only to save her childhood home, but also to survive financially. She ended up losing both her parents\u2019 and her aunt\u2019s home, and was left with barely enough to buy a humble house that she knew needed some aesthetic improvements. \n\nThe new home had passed an inspection and therefore Frances was not aware of the severity of damages in the home.  When she moved in, she found that the home was plagued with problems such as, multiple holes in the roof, a falling ceiling and several other leakage issues that made the home practically uninhabitable. Frances has had to keep her belongings in storage, her pets boarded, and has almost depleted her savings trying to fix the home to make it livable.  Her ultimate goal is to gain financial strength and stability so that she can provide a safe and secure environment for herself, as well as for her young patients. She keeps her hopes up and continues to make a positive difference in the lives of the young boys and girls that she helps. \n\nWith her KIVA loan, Frances will be able to install a drywall ceiling and a much needed air conditioner that will allow her to improve her services by providing a healthier, more comfortable and overall better environment for herself and her patients.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3318.14,"image":{"id":1633108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

She is always looking for new ways that will allow her to progress in life.\r\n\r\nFor five years Cristina has been working as a dressmaker. She learned this trade on the job, observing others at work. Later, little by little, Cristina perfected her techniques and developed her knowledge through practice. This drove Cristina to open her own workshop.\r\n\r\nTo do this, Cristina set up in a space in her home and used some savings to buy her first sewing machines. She works alone every day but, on occasion, receives support from one other person, depending on the number of orders that she may have. This work has allowed Cristina to earn a sufficient income to cover household costs.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to strengthen Cristina's work. She will use the money to buy a sewing machine for attaching buttons. This machine will speed up the production process, and allow Cristina to win more contracts and make her business more profitable.\r\n\r\nCristina tells us that her biggest challenge is competition. This, however, continues to motivate her so that she offers better service and she continues to fight so that her business operates fully and she can offer job opportunities to others. By doing all of this, Cristina can improve her quality of life, and the quality of life of others who make a difference to her

married women who, on average, are 46 years old and have three children. They mostly live in traditional families in Zerlaba, one of the villages in Sikasso, the third administrative region of Mali. They are collaborating with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to better carry out their farming activities during the rainy season.

She hails from a poor family below the poverty line. She is standing extreme left with raised hand in the photo. She is 30 years old and lives with her husband, two sons age 9 and 7 years and her daughter, age 3 years, in a small mud hut. Her two sons are continuing study in government school.\r\n \r\nGayatri has been running a tiffin stall (serving small meals or snacks) for the last eight years with the hand-holding support of her husband in a rented cabin in the market. Apart from this, her husband also prepares different types of sweets items as per the order for different social festivals. Gayatri gets a monthly income of INR 5,000 from the above business. Out of this income she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.  \r\n\r\nFrom the present loan, Gayatri wants to purchase more stock of oil, dough, sugar, fuel, etc. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she has to replenish her stock frequently. From her little savings from her income, Gayatri has purchased a small piece of land. As her present stall is a rented one, she hopes to construct a cabin of her own on the purchased land. This will give her more confidence and there will be no risk of having to vacate it.\r\n \r\nThe other four members of the group are Ranju, Mamata, Sailabala and Rina, who are running a barber shop, a tiffin stall, a tiffin push cart and a rice business, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1645568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing oil, dough, sugar, fuel etc. for her tiffin stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T12:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T12:50:01Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gayatri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sailabala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":66000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-16T08:09:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":737025,"name":"Biti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Biti lives at the coastal region of Kenya.

After harvesting, she sells her produce at the village and in Sikasso, to a mixed clientele, for cash and on credit.\r\nShe plans to earn an average of 73,000 West African francs per agricultural cycle.\r\nThis revenue will allow her to pay off her loan with interest and also help her husband with everyday expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1644991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for fertilizers, herbicides and the cost of labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Zerlaba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata Salifou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou Binafou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby Madou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teintio Youssouf ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diaratou Diakalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diara Madou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teintio Salif ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marietou Lamine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":457829.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758149}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T03:10:41Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T15:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":736245,"name":"Alexandra Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alexandra es una madre muy trabajadora, para sacar a delante y darle la educaci\u00f3n a sus tres peque\u00f1os ha trabajado duro, actualmente se dedica a dar servicio de tapizada para una empresa de fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles, cuenta con un empleado, un joven que le ayuda ya que este trabajo no es tan f\u00e1cil, mientras sus hijos acuden a la escuela ella se dedica a tapizar los muebles las mismas que son hermosas artes.\nAlexandra se siente muy feliz  a pesar de su trabajo cansado, ya que por las tardes puede compartir con sus peque\u00f1os.\nCon este cr\u00e9dito ella podr\u00e1 comprar telas y esponja indispensable en su negocio, podr\u00e1 surtir la variedad de tela y mejorar la calidad de muebles.

Kindly meet Barnabas, a 37-year-old active and hardworking man who resides in the Kitale area of Kenya, an area known to experience the best weather patterns and also known as the bread basket of Kenya. He is a family man, and he cherishes his wife and four kids.\n\nBarnabas has been practicing farming for the past 10 years, and he has been able to take care of his family. Throughout the 10 years that he has practiced farming, Barnabas has been able to gather a lot of experience in farming and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips.\n\nBeing a responsible man who cherishes his family, Barnabas wants to see his family grow economically and also have an impact in society, so he wants to increase his farming business. This is why he is seeking a loan of KES 52,000 to be able to buy a dairy cow, which would in return increase his milk production levels. The cow dung from the cow will be used as fertilizer in his small kitchen garden, where he grows vegetables to sell and for home consumption.\n\nBarnabas is very comfortable with the repayment period and monthly installments, and his projections are that he will be able to clear the loan even before the due date.\n\nThrough the loan Barnabas would be able to sell milk to his neighbors and also to the nearby villages, hence generating a lot of profit which would result in a better living condition for his family and the society.\n\nBarnabas's target and dream is to open a milk processing plant once he has accumulated more

This area is known for being commercially and touristically productive. \r\n\r\nGeogina is a small business owner who makes tortillas in her home and sells cooked beans. She starts her work every day the night before by cooking corn in ash, and she starts at 4:00am grinding corn and forming tortillas. Later she cooks the beans, which she prepares between 4:10am and 5:30pm. She has worked in this business for more than 20 years. She initially started her business with her own capital when she saw the need that existed within her neighbors, and she wanted to help her children to get ahead being a single mother. At the same time, she saw that it was a profitable business, and with just a small amount of capital one can get started, and her business has slowly grown. She makes her purchases in cash in the markets and distributors in her area, and she has steady and eventual clients. \r\n\r\nGeogina is known for being a strong, hardworking and responsible woman who really wants to get ahead. She has gotten her children ahead all by herself, and one of her dreams is to be able to watch her business grow even more. She would also like to make some improvements to her home, which she will leave to her children in the future.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to invest in her business for working capital to purchase daily needs such as corn, beans, firewood, lime powder, garlic and salt, among others because the demand for her products is fairly large, and this way she will earn more from her business.

Meet Hyline, a mother of four cute babies, who lives in the Nyamira area of Kenya. This area is known to be a very fertile area although the population rate is very high. But that does not prevent farmers there from being productive because they are experiencing favorable weather patterns. Hyline, being a hardworking farmer, is able to take care of her family single handedly and provide them with the basic needs including food, shelter, clothing and education. She has been practicing farming for the past eight years and throughout those years, she has gained so much experience in farming and dairy farming. Even though Hyline is hardworking, she has one problem, which is the lack of funds to improve her livestock on the farm. That is why she is seeking a loan of KES 20,800 to purchase a dairy cow. The dairy cow will assist her in increasing her income through selling milk to the nearby neighbors and villages. In addition, with the dairy cow, she is able to get manure that will be used on her arm.\n\nHyline will be able to pay the loan without defaulting and promises to pay the loan on time because she is very comfortable with the repayment

Meet Celestine, a humble, honest, caring and hardworking mother of three lovely children. She hails from the Nandi hills area of Kenya, a place known to have good climatic conditions for farming. Celestine has been doing farming for the past 14 years and has been able to take care of her children.\r\n \r\nBeing a single mother, she has to work extra hard so that she can put food on the table for her children. Through hard work, persistence and patience, she practices mixed farming and has even been able to buy a cow that she has nicknamed \u201ccheseker\u201d. This dairy cow is one of the most important things that Celestine treasures and adores a lot because of the profits that she gets from selling milk.\r\n\r\nCelestine has one problem: this cow does not have a cow unit where it can rest or graze and be milked, which is reducing her milk production. Therefore, she is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 to buy a cow unit. With the cow unit, the cow will improve its milk production and this will mean more money and profits.\r\n\r\nThrough the profits generated, Celestine will be able to secure the future of her children and assure them of a bright future through giving them a solid education.\r\n\r\nCelestine is sure of paying the loan on time and she has a long-term goal of keeping more dairy cows.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1648423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a cow unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.4,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3143},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3705.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3805.48},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3942.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4014.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4149.63},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4234.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4348.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4514},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4586.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4718.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4837.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.51,"local_amount":8479.18,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T13:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8551.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517570965},{"amount":42.98,"local_amount":3737.08,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3769.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054353},{"amount":90.16,"local_amount":7839.68,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7906.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680523},{"amount":91.36,"local_amount":7944.21,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8012.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823358},{"amount":87.28,"local_amount":7648.39,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7713.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.68,"payment_id":665458728},{"amount":144.79,"local_amount":13351.45,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13465.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.75,"payment_id":696588703},{"amount":10.52,"local_amount":1000.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.97,"payment_id":711507226}],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T22:19:19Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:56:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":735470,"name":"Araz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Araz is 23 years old.

Samvel also works at an airport to cover his living expenses and help his uncle's family. \n\nIt is really hard for this 22 year old young man to combine his job with his studies, but he does everything he can to make ends meet. Because of financial difficulties, Samvel is not able to save money for his education. This is why he is asking for this loan. With the help of the loan, he will be able to cover his university tuition."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1644870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Bolangir district in Odisha, India. Tetelkhunti is a rural village in one of the poor region of the state. She hails from a poor family in that village. She is an active micro entrepreneur. In May 2014, she and five other women entrepreneurs in her village formed a group named Bublen-A to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their business. The lady sitting second from right in the photo raising her hand is Binodini. She lives with her husband and one son, 22 years old, in a small house. Her son helps in her business.\r\n\r\nBinodini is running a small business frying bold gram and selling it at retail for the last 12 years. She fries the bold gram and her husband and son move from village to village to sell it. She purchases raw bold gram in bulk, fries it and sells it. In a week, she purchases 100 kgs of gram. From this business, she gets a monthly income of Rs 6,000.  Out of this income, she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Binodini wants to purchase more stock of raw gram from the present loan to run her business throughout the rainy season, which is a lean period for her. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she has to replenish her stock frequently. As her son is already at the marriageable age, Binodini hopes to save enough for building a good house of her own and completing the marriage of her son in the near future.\r\n \r\nThe other five members of the group are Sunanda, Tapaswini, Rebati, Saraswati and Basanti who are running a tailoring center, a cycle repair center, bold gram selling, and puffed rice selling businesses, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1645637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase bold gram in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TETELKHUNTI, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sunanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tapaswini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binodini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T00:46:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":737141,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Tetelkhunti is a rural based village in one of the poor region of the state. Tarulata, about 54 years old, is one of the members of this group. She hails from a poor family and lives with her husband, one son age 19 and one daughter age 17. \r\n \r\nTarulata has been running a small business of frying gram and selling it at retail for the last 17 years. This is the only source of income for her. She fries the gram and her husband and son sells it at retail by moving from village to village. She purchases raw gram in bulk and fries it to sell. In a week, she purchases 100 kgs of gram. From this business, she gets a monthly income of Rs 5000.  From this income, she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Tarulata wants to purchase more stock of raw gram with the loan to run her business throughout the rainy season. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she purchases the stock on a regular basis. Tarulata hopes to construct a house and complete the marriage of her son and daughter respectfully. The other four members of the group are Sabita, Nilakanti, Gita and Malli who are running fried gram selling businesses and fish businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1645672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more stock of raw grams to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TETELKHUNTI, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tarulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilakanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T18:02:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}}]}
