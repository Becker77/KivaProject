With this she will be able to improve her family's quality of life and continue striving as she has always done, to fulfill her greatest dream: \"To have my own business in my home.\" Thank you Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1645027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To buy merchandise for her business selling fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Palpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2014-07-15T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-14T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":102.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":106.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":116.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":122.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":126.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":131.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":139.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":142.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":148.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.4,"local_amount":96.54,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":98.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517510962},{"amount":37.62,"local_amount":102.59,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T09:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530788383},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":106.88,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":108.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542485133},{"amount":41.42,"local_amount":112.98,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":114.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562396672},{"amount":42.56,"local_amount":116.07,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:20:04Z","rounded_local_amount":118.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579528097},{"amount":44.82,"local_amount":122.24,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":124.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595127461},{"amount":46.13,"local_amount":126.03,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":128.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":610522969},{"amount":47.59,"local_amount":131.29,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-25T09:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":133.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.55,"payment_id":624817138},{"amount":209.88,"local_amount":585.38,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-30T11:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":595.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.76,"payment_id":636181350}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T03:15:13Z","paid_date":"2015-04-30T11:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":737155,"name":"Carolyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carolyne is a 28-year-old married lady blessed with two children.

","en":"Turdubu is 65 years old, married, and the mother of six children. For more than twenty years she has worked raising livestock and farming. She started her business with ten sheep. Because of Turdubu's extremely hard work along with her family's unity, they have made great strides in developing the farm, and they began to receive a monthly income from selling goat and cow milk. The farm has three dairy cows, three horses, fifty sheep, and 1.20 hectares of irrigated land where Turdubu grows beans and potatoes. In order to further develop her farm, Turdubu approached the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan of 150,000 KGS to buy five bulls and nitrate. Turdubu plans to invest profit from the loan into further increasing her livestock on the farms, and in the future, she plans to renovate her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1647870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

His father is from El Salvador.  Ramiro's family was one of five brothers who worked hard at cotton production and farming (planting corn and beans).  More than forty years ago, he and his father came to El Salvador to live.   Ramiro's wife works at selling clothes for all ages in the community; they are parents of two children, ages 13 and 14.  \r\nRamiro learned to work at construction thirty years ago, taught by his uncle and some friends.  Since he was a young man, he worked as a mason's assistant along with his father and relatives.  Today he works from Monday through Saturday as a master craftsman on various construction projects.  He used to work helping his father raise cattle. \r\nHe is seeking a loan from CREDICAMPO to buy merchandise (clothes for all ages) and needs $500 to be able to afford to buy 437.50 square meters of land for sale in his community.\r\nWith the clothing sales, he will along with his wife increase sales since she also supports the household with the profits to support the family. His small piece of land will be a place to build his own home, since now he is renting along with his wife.  Owning his own home in the future will permit him to give the children a better quality of life.\r\nOne of the dreams that matters most to Ramiro is to build his home little by little, a place to rest and give a secure home to his children.  Besides this he wants to continue with various construction projects, and to continue supporting his wife in her clothing sales.  Since this business has been profitable for them, he goes out to sell at nearby communities.

He wants to buy tires, rims, rods, cables, spark plugs, light bulbs, mirrors, chains, brakes, shock absorbers, seals, cylinders, gaskets, bearings, and other parts he needs in his store.

She lives in a small house that the government donated to her family for having a chid with a handicap.  All of her children are studying including her son who is disabled and has to go to the nearest city in order to be able to attend classes.  Her husband works in fishing and in his free time, works on appliance repairs.  Taking advantage of the location of their house, she sells nutritious snacks to students of the school that is in front of her home.  With the past loan, she was able to buy several windows and purchase a bazaar with a large product variety.  Also, Leyla makes jewelry with native materials.  With this new loan, she hopes to fill her home with children's clothes, interior items, and nutritional snacks for students.  In a span of 3-5 years, Leyla wants to have a place to hold her business and not continue in her home because it is too small.  She feels that FODEMI is a great help for the people that need financial capital to improve the quality of life of their neighbors and their community, by strengthening small businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5600,"image":{"id":1645092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is from one of the municipalities of Chinandega located in the western part of the country.  She is known for being an enterprising, hard-working, responsible woman with a great desire for personal success.  She is a small business owner who sells merchandise in general such as children's clothing, adult pants, shirts, dresses, shorts, skirts, underwear, and also silver, gold, cosmetics, shoes, sandals, hair color, women's and men's perfumes, deodorants, shampoo, jewlery, creams, nail polish remover, hair accessories, and other items.  The business is located in one of the markets in the town.  \r\n\r\nShe makes her purchases in cash at the wholesale market in another department she travels to every two weeks.  She sells in cash and on a credit basis to fixed and eventual customers.  Nowadays she has a higher demand for her products because she also delivers to them to her clients.  Her income has increased and one of her goals is to expand business to earn more income.  She also wants to see her son become successful in life.\r\n\r\nThis new loan is to buy a variety of new merchandise to fill orders she has from customers.  Sandra Lucia is grateful for the support Kiva lenders give to small merchants so they have work and can survive with their families in a country where things are scarce, with a lack of resources for future generations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1642560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

All of them are married and they have five children under their care. They are from one of the towns in northern Chinandega, located in the western part of the country. The members of this group know each other very well because they are from the same area. That is why they decided to opt for a loan under the Support Group modality so they could offer each other financial support and invest in their different businesses. Petrona, who is the coordinator of the group and in charge of responsibility and punctuality of payments, is a micro-businesswoman who buys and sells basic grains such as jicaro seeds, peanuts, beans, sorghum, and more. She also manages a mobile DJ service and offers the service in her town at any event, such as quincieneras, weddings, birthdays, local festivals and more. She started her business when she married, seeking dignified work to help with the family expenses. She couldn't get a job because she didn't finish her education because unfortunately she came from a low income family and she had to work since she was very young to contribute the household budget. Therefore, she fights day to day to offer a better future to her children. She has 20 years' experience in this type of business and service and this is how she has been able to keep her children in school. One of her dreams is to be able to keep offering her children the chance to go to college that their parents never had. She pays for her purchases up front and is paid up front and on credit. Most of her products are sold on credit and she she doesn't keep products in her house very often because they are delivered every two days. The purpose of this new loan is to invest in buying basic grain products such as corn, beans, sorghum, and jicaro seeds, as well as to do maintenance on her mobile DJ equipment, among other things. Demand is increasing and this way she can offer her customers a better service. The El Arca de Noe II support group thanks the Kiva investors for the help they offer small business people from poor countries such as Nicaragua so that they can have a dignified life.

She is the single mother of two daughters, of whom only one is still under her care. She is from Chinandegana, located in the western part of the country. She is described as a hardworking, responsible woman who really wants to get ahead. In her free time, she likes to spend quality time with her daughter and make the area's traditional dish, called Indio Viejo. Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources, she wasn't able to go to college because she had to work from an early age to help with the household expenses. Ver\u00f3nica is a micro businesswoman and manager of a small store where she offers daily consumption products in small quantities such as coffee envelopes, shampoo envelopes, loose cigarettes, rice, sugar, beans, oil, bread, milk, sodas, juices, detergent, soap, chicken, sanitary napkins, toilet paper, sardines, Maggi soup envelopes, Maruchan soups, frozen food and more. She pays for her purchases up front from distributors who deliver the merchandise to her door and she is paid up front or sometimes on credit with regular customers. She started this business with her own capital and funds because they are products that are consumed all year round. She started with a little \"truchita\" (a very small business). Little by little she has increased her inventory. One of her dreams is to be able to grow her business more and have more financial stability and build a room. The purpose of this loan is to invest in working capital and stock her business and buy basic grains and snacks, sodas, oil, and frozen food. This way, she can expand her business to buy at better products and stock a wider variety of products more in demand, earning more income and offering better prices to her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1642578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products such as basic grains, detergents, firewood, frozen food, snacks, and more.

","en":"Fe y Esperanza I Solidarity Group is made up of three members: Carla Cristina, Mar\u00eda Lizeth, and Juana Francisca.  They're all single and live in one of the towns in Chinandega, in the western part of the country, with nine minor children.  The area is known for being commercially productive, for tourism, for its beautiful beaches, and for selling shellfish, bananas, and other products.\r\n\r\nThese members know each other very well because they're from the same area.  They decided to form a solidarity group to support each other financially and invest in their businesses: butchering pigs, tortillas, cooked beans, firewood, garments, and others.\r\n\r\nCarla coordinates the group and is responsible for each member making her payment on time.  She earns a living butchering pigs and by-products, including fried cheese, fried fish, nacatamales [Nicaraguan tamales], moronga [morcilla] sausage, and grilled meat.  She also has a tortilla shop.  She purchases in cash from merchants near her town and in wholesale markets.  She makes her sales in cash to regular and occasional customers.\r\n\r\nCarla started her business more than 10 years ago, having learned it at a young age from her mother, who worked in the field of pig butchering.  She became independent with her own capital.  She butchers twice a week and also makes tortillas three times every day from an early hour as well as cooked beans for her customers without fail.  One of her dreams is to be able to expand her business and satisfy her customers' needs.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this loan is to invest in working capital to stock her business with corn, lime, firewood, pigs, leaves, beans, achiote, potatoes, salt, raisins, mint, and other ingredients to make her delicious nacatamales, tortillas, and fried beans and increase her profits in the near future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1645024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives there with her husband. Varsenik's 19-year-old son serves in the army. Jointly with her husband, she has been engaged in animal husbandry for a long time. Particularly, they breed cattle, sheep and hens. \r\n\r\nVarsenik is planning to make some investments into her family's agribusiness. She has taken a loan from a financial institution before, but because of the family's poor conditions, she wasn't able to pay it back. However, over these years of tireless work, she was able to own her agribusiness, which is profitable enough to cover monthly payments. \r\n\r\nVarsenik has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have bad credit history behind them and have no access to credit products.

This place is known for being very dynamic, where most of its inhabitants work in agriculture and raise animals, because it is an area of great vegetation. This group is formed by 8 women and 2 men, who decided to join some time ago and form this Credit Group, that has been very helpful, because with the loans they have been able to improve their small businesses. They work in different activities such as commerce, animal husbandry and agriculture. One of the group members is Silvia. She is 64 years old, separated and has four older children, three of whom still live with her. Silvia is a very hardworking woman who likes to earn her own money so she does not depend on anyone. She works selling clothes and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and women's accessories). Her way of selling is door to door. She works three days a week from two to three hours per day. She leaves her products on a loan basis and is paid eight days later. She has been working for more than four years in this activity and is doing very well. What she sells most are perfumes and cosmetics because they are very good. She will use this loan to buy perfumes, creams, cosmetics and clothes. This is her first loan cycle with this Credit Group, and she likes it because the loans are fast. Her dream is to have a boutique. The small photo shows the three member, who could not be present when the group photo was taken.

She is planning to use her loan to buy two 50-kilo bags of fertilizers, one can of herbicide, and to cover the cost of plowing on 0.5 hectare of land. After the harvest, she sells her crops in her village and in Sikasso. Her customers are both men and women and they pay her in cash or on credit. She is expecting to make an average profit of 73,000 CFA francs per planting season.

She is 29 years old, married and lives with her family; her husband and parents. The only income for the family is from her father's small monthly salary, as he works in a plastic factory. Aleksandra has requested a loan from a local financial institution several times for a business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-ups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the requested loan, Aleksandra will start up a dental clinic locally. She will purchase dental equipment and operative supplies to satisfy the professional needs of the dentists that will be working at her clinic. Aleksandra hopes her business will be profitable because of the price range and well-qualified dentists. This will increase her income and the family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs in order to improve their living

Arman\u2019s father from time to time goes to Russian Federation and from there supports his family financially. \r\n\r\nArman, besides his education, has another occupation in which he is engaged very seriously and with great pleasure. With the help of his mother he is busy with grape cultivation. He has a nice vineyard on his own plot of land. He has different sorts of grapes but the world-known grape named kishmish here is the best. As Arman says, the care of his vineyard demands much time and patience: like you take care of a child, grape cultivation demands the same carefulness. You must manage to protect all the harvest from the hail, frostbite, and also from harmful insects. He has a lot of regular customers (re-sellers), who from his house buy a great portion of grapes.\r\n\r\nSo this loan will be of great use for Arman if he gets it. He plans to use the loan amount for the work of cultivating his beautiful vineyard for the coming season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1646530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to work on cultivating his beautiful vineyard","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ararat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2014-07-16T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-15T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15560.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15502.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":15656.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":16130.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":16293.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":16295.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":16878.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":17111.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":17173.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17585},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":17774.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18037.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.94,"local_amount":16375.4,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T15:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16683.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517719957},{"amount":43.04,"local_amount":17216.5,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-28T09:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":17540.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542632059},{"amount":84.53,"local_amount":33812.9,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T11:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":34448.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561766010},{"amount":43.82,"local_amount":18094.3,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-18T10:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":18434.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.42,"payment_id":579721758},{"amount":42.67,"local_amount":18204.7,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":18546.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.84,"payment_id":595289451},{"amount":41.55,"local_amount":17777,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":18111.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.89,"payment_id":611936178},{"amount":44.77,"local_amount":18938.4,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":19294.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.58,"payment_id":636721251},{"amount":40.81,"local_amount":17542.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":17872.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.05,"payment_id":649700707},{"amount":98.84,"local_amount":42038.3,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":42828.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.25,"payment_id":665189670}],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T02:34:41Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T14:55:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zoe Benston","image":null}},{"id":737543,"name":"Michelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michelle works hard to support her family.

They are looking forward eagerly to working with Namaste where they will receive financial literacy training, and also a business adviser who will help each of them write a business plan and then work with them monthly to follow the plan and grow their business.\nOne member of this group is Juana (second from left) who is 26 years old and has gone to school through the third grade.  She is married with four children (ages 9, 6, 4 and 1).  The two older children attend school.  Her husband works at the community health center and helps her support the family economically. Her business is sewing and selling the traditional skirts and blouses that are worn by the women in her area.  Some of her customers order specific items and she sells the rest door to door.  Her first language is K\u2019iche but she also speaks Spanish. She very much enjoys being a businesswoman and speaking the two languages is an advantage to her in her business.  Her goal is to learn as much as she can during her time working with Namaste so that she can improve her business. She dreams of increasing her profits enough so that all of her children can stay in school and get an education. And she herself would like to go back to primary school and take up her education where she had to leave it years ago.\nJuana will be using her loan money to buy more fabric so she can produce more clothing to meet her clients\u2019 demands.

This is an an area rich with dense vegetation where the vast majority of indigenous Maya work on small-scale farms. \r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank are enthusiastic and motivated to work hard and improve their quality of life. Mar\u00eda is a member of the group who has a food business. She sells \u201cGarnachas,\u201d a traditional Guatemalan appetizer made of meat or beans, chiles, sauce and cheese, as well as French fries. This 25-year-old hard-working lady joined the group to acquire capital for her small business and to purchase necessary supplies including corn, lime, meat and potatoes. She learned to cook from her mother, and after getting married, decided to open her own food business. She sells her delicious food in front of her house on weekends. Mar\u00eda is an example of a successful woman, who along with her husband, supports her small three-year-old daughter. The couple is determined to focus on their goal of maintaining their new household and seeing their daughter complete her education.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is happy to be a member of the Trust Bank and has been elected treasurer. She has the trust and support of the other ladies in the group. She is very enthusiastic, along with everyone in the Trust Bank, to acquire knowledge about how to improve her standard of living, take care of her family, and ensure the success of her small food business. Each month, a Friendship Bridge loan officer shares useful information with all of the women on how to effectively manage their loans, improve the health of their families and understand their rights as women. \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is the name that Friendship Bridge gives to this valuable combination of education and small loans.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly impossible for an indigenous woman to walk into a bank in Guatemala and request a loan. Non-governmental organizations like Friendship Bridge offer a valuable opportunity for impoverished women to empower themselves and move themselves, their families and their communities forward. Kiva lenders are most appreciated for their willingness and generosity in providing capital for loans.

They are collaborating with microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to build up their agricultural businesses during the rainy season. They are on their sixth seasonal loan with microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, and the previous loans were properly repaid. The crops grown are rice with Mrs. ASSATA, sitting on the far right in the photo in this women\u2019s group JEKAWILI 3. With this loan, she plans to buy three 50-kg sacks of fertilizer and two containers of herbicide and to pay for labor to maintain 0.5 hectares.

They are all adults with their own families living in Russia. Maalimkan has a secondary education. As an additional source of income for her family, she works in animal husbandry. She started more than thirty years ago when she bought some cattle. Because of Maalimkan's hard work, her farm now has six dairy cows, six sheep, one horse and a 2 hectare plot of land. Maalimkan and her spouse grow corn, which serves as food for cattle. On .7 hectares they have planted watermelons, and on the rest of the land they grow peppers. Their monthly income is about 7,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her farm, Maalimkan approached the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy fertilizer for the soil to increase her crop yield in the fall and increase profits. A good harvest is important for Maalimkan and her family, and eco-friendly products are in great demand among buyers. Maalimkan plans to invest profits from the loan in the further expansion of her business, and she wants to save enough money to repair her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1648426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers for growing environment friendly vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kashgar-Kyshtak village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-16T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-15T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maalimkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":296.66,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15534.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.34,"payment_id":561578530},{"amount":285.3,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15534.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.7,"payment_id":595436340}],"funded_date":"2014-07-17T13:56:24Z","paid_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":737633,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther, age 25, is a Zoona agent, operating her own mobile money transfer business. This business allows customers without bank accounts to send money to rural areas. It is easy, quick, and safe. People in Esther\u2019s community, Chilanga, come to her to send and receive money, so the outlet plays an integral part in the community. \r\n\r\nThis inspiring young woman loves being an entrepreneur. Running her own business has given Esther the opportunity to be flexible while she continues her schooling. She is able to earn an income while working to obtain a diploma. In addition to running her own operation, she also works part-time at another Zoona booth as a teller. Esther currently employs two ladies who work in her booth. One of them is her twin sister. They live together in Chilanga. Their goal is to build a strong, supportive business for the future. \r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of running her own outlet have allowed Esther to be independent and disciplined in her decisions. In Zambia, working capital is difficult to obtain, so Esther appreciates the opportunity to be connected with Kiva. She currently faces a challenge in that she does not have enough electronic money or cash for some transactions, so she has to turn customers away, which she dislikes having to do.
