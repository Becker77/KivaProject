He studied until ninth grade because he did not have enough money and neither did his parents so they could not support him financially.  He used to work in the mornings and in the afternoons he would go to school, but he found it very difficult to do both. For this reason, he was not able to continue attending school, and instead he decided to get married and start his own family.  In his home, only his wife and son live with him and depend on him.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has two jobs that generate an income for his family.  His first job is with an electrical company where he has worked for three years.  He landed this job thanks to a friend who recommended him.  The company is 5 kilometers away and he gets there on his motorcycle.  He works there from 8am to 3pm.  He also works as a farmer, growing vegetables, which he has done since he was young.  It is a very productive activity for him and his wife who helps him with the work.  In addition to generating income for them, it also provides them with food.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is seeking will be used specifically for farming to grow pear squash.  He will purchase a roll of wire to build a structure for the crops to develop perfectly.  He will also purchase a sack of manure to apply to the crops, and pay for labor.  This will allow him to generate greater earnings because he always wanted to have crops that were well arranged and cared for. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 never loses hope of being able to attend college with his wife.  He also dreams of having a better job, repairing his home, purchasing a vehicle that will facilitate his farming, increasing his crops and improving his crops so that they will yield greater harvests.  He says that he will achieve all of this with the earnings from his sales and with other loans that he will seek to reach his dreams.

She has worked in agriculture for many years, principally growing cacao. She also sells traditional beverages such as Chuchuhuasi, Indanachado, and Seven Roots, among others. It is going very well for her because she is very responsible and hard-working, and she always makes an effort to offer quality products to her customers.\r\n\r\nLina is grateful to the Kiva lenders because with the support that they have offered her, she will be able to buy supplies such as fertilizers to be able to fertilize her crops, and she will be able to do the respective maintenance. In this way she will obtain products of better quality and more earnings.

tourist trade. Sarbia owns two small businesses: she makes tortillas and sells firewood in her home. She has had these businesses for five years. Sarbia starts her work the night before business, preparing the corn for the tortillas. She then wakes up at 4am in order to prepare the first batch of her delicious tortillas; she starts on the second batch at 10am, and the last at 4pm. Each day Sarbia uses around 70 lbs of corn for making the tortillas. She buys her supplies in cash at the local market, and also sells for cash. Sarbia has regular customers, and one-timers, from her local area. \r\n\r\nSarbia started her business with few funds, and was looking for a decent life and help with household costs. Little by little Sarbia\u2019s businesses have grown but she sees a need to invest more as demand has grown because of the good service that she offers. \r\n\r\nOne of Sarbia\u2019s dreams is to build more rooms in her home so that she can enjoy better living conditions. In the future Sarbia would like to be a mum and wants to offer her children the best that she can. At her business, she wants to expand and be fully equipped at her premises.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this loan is to invest in necessary supplies for her businesses, such as corn lime and firewood.

Having a big family requires a lot of effort to provide for everyone\u2019s needs.\r\nShe sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every week.\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Janeta wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan amounting to PHP 15,000 (Philippines pesos) to buy additional merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products that are needed to increase her product inventory. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\nBesides growing her business, Janeta hopes to give her children a good life and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She works hard to provide for her everyday needs, and especially her children's.\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\nTo increase her product inventory as well as improve her sales, Gemalyn would like to avail a loan amounting to PHP 20,000 (Philippines pesos) which she will be utilizing to buy additional grocery items. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve her business through this financial assistance.\r\nGemalyn hopes that she will soon have her own grocery store. She dreams of financial security particularly for her children's education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs. She also has an apartment, and she is a jeepney operator for additional income.\r\nNenita maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. \r\nNenita hopes to have a bigger network and dreams that her business will grow bigger. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

married with three children.  She has a high school education and she is currently working.  Her husband works as a chief specialist of family and child welfare, but his income is not enough to support his own family, which is why Farida works as a farmer to supplement the household income.  She started her agricultural work 25 years ago and thanks to her hard work, her farm now has one dairy cow, one bull and eight sheep.  They also have a 2.7 hectare plot of land, where Farida grows barley.\r\n\r\nFarida's family members actively help her around the house, as well as with the milk production.  Their monthly income is 3,500 som (KGS).  With the goal of increasing their business, Farida has turned to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) to buy cows so she can increase her milk production, as well as to buy bulls to fatten up and resell.  The income from this loan will allow her to increase her business, improve her family's living standard, and to buy the car her family

is a very hard-working entrepreneur from Taguig City, Philippines. She is 40 years old and has three children who are currently in school. Solly, her husband, works as a driver and helps her to provide for their needs. She manages a business buying and selling ready-to-wear products, and her income from the business helps with their everyday needs and expenses.\r\n\r\nWhat she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and then sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from ready-to-wear clothing and eye-wear to footwear and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTomanina is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan to purchase more products and merchandise to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to have her own stall for her business. She also desires her children to be able to complete their studies as well as to improve the general living condition of her family. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In her business, the regular customers are from the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy spare parts and accessories for her motorcycle, as well as to maintain the motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCatherine dreams to be able to give her family a good life and hopes to give her children a good quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets every week with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1647087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

It went well and since then she has done both activities.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for is to buy an industrial griddle to have more space to make pupusas; the one she has currently is very damaged. The other part of the loan will be invested in buying shelves on which to put the products she sells in her store as well as buying more merchandise to sell.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has planned to expand her business, to buy more products to sell and to get her griddle.

For the past two years, Shilly has been working hard to manage her small business, where she sells charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shilly has requested a loan of 600,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more sacks of charcoal to sell, and will help Shilly to generate greater profits and open up another business around town. Shilly hopes that in the future, she will be able to open a retail shop. \r\n\r\nShilly is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Sharifa is 16 years old and lives in the town of Busia in the Iganga region of Uganda. For the past one year, Sharifa has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where he sells essential commodities. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sharifa has requested a loan of 150,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential goods like sugar and salt for the business, and will help Sharifa to generate greater profits and to buy basic needs for her family. Sharifa hopes that in the future, she will be able to transform the business into a restaurant. \r\n\r\nSharifa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1647215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Hajira is 22 years old and lives in the town of Busia in the Iganga region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Hajira has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hajira has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more shirts and trousers for sale, and will help Hajira to generate greater profits and increase her stock. Hajira hopes that in the future she will be able to start selling second-hand clothes. \r\n\r\nHajira is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1647220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

decided to build a secured future for their families. They formed a group named \u201cBaba Nilakanthaeswara Self-Help Group\u201d (named after Lord Shiva, who they believe will protect them). The members of Baba Nilakanthaeswara Self-Help Group are all women from the district of Khurda in Odisha, India. \r\n\r\nOne of them is Mrs. Manjulata, who was selected as their president. The lady standing with her raised hand in the photo is Manjulata. Manjulata is 26 years old and is staying with her husband and her child. Her husband has been involved in vegetable and paddy farming for a long time. \r\n\r\nShe got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took the leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village. She took some land for lease and started vegetable cultivation on a small scale. She started with a limited supply of vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes and grew to sell more than seven varieties such as brinjal (eggplant), cucumbers, beans, carrots, and radishes. She has developed a very good relationship with her customers in the village, as she sells fresh and high-quality vegetables. She likes the fact that she can cater to the needs of the people in her village. \r\n\r\nNow she has a new idea of doing sugarcane cultivation, for which she has requested a loan to utilize for the resources necessary to grow sugarcane. A portion of the loan amount will help her to purchase sugarcane plants, fertilizers, and insecticides, and to cover operational expenses like labor charges.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1647092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for resources such as sugarcane plants, fertilizers, and insecticides for her sugarcane plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Khurda, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-07-17T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-16T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":3675,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manjulata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suchitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binapani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabhama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urabasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nirmala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sopnarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":220000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":220000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T08:49:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":737935,"name":"Vanroen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aged 25 years old, Varoen is a married mother of two little children living in a rural village of the Bovel district of Battambang province, Cambodia.

the western highlands of Guatemala. The women have joined together to expand their small businesses, improve their lives, help their families prosper and eliminate poverty. This loan cycle is the first time that they are requesting loans from Kiva and only the second time from Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nSonia is a 39-year-old member of the Trust Bank and has four children. She has had three years of formal education, and because of her leadership skills and her great desire to excel, Sonia has been elected president of the group. She has a convenience store and is requesting a loan to add inventory to her store. Sonia needs to purchase rice, beans, oil, salt, noodles, sugar and drinks in order to meet the demand of her customers.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the women learn how to manage their loans, so the Microcredit Plus program of Friendship Bridge is especially useful for them. A loan officer attends their monthly meetings and shares relevant information with the ladies on subjects like accounting, budgeting, customer service, indebtedness, marketing and pricing. The ladies also benefit from increased knowledge about health, hygiene and nutrition, as well as the use of medicinal plants. Attending their meetings, one notices more smiles and increased self esteem.\r\n\r\nSonia and her friends in the \u201cMargaritas de Xejuy\u00fa\u201d Trust Bank extend their heartfelt gratitude to Kiva investors. They feel fortunate to be together, to work toward the common goals of empowering themselves and eliminating poverty in their families and community. Kiva investors are valuable partners in this effort!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1648190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, beans, oil, salt, noodles, sugar and drinks.
