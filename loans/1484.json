Currently, sows that she already owned have given birth to 20 piglets, and Made also bought a new sow from her last loan's profit. Now she has 9 sows.\r\n\r\nBut she is plagued with the waste generated by the pigs in large quantities. For that, she joined the biogas program from MUK. In addition to their funding, she will build a biogas reactor to maximize waste from the pig manure. In addition, she will receive an organic fertilizer that will be very useful for soil fertility in her garden. Made gets a 25.000.000 IDR loan. 10.000.000 IDR will be used to build the reactor and 15.000.000 IDR will be used to buy superior quality piglets and feed and make a new cage.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags per hectare, which is double the national average of 14. \r\n\r\nHowever, Baturiya Tiyau is ambitious and is aiming to reap 35 bags per hectare this season. When asked, Baturiya Tiyau said, \u201cI plan to use the money I make to educate my children, Yahaya, Naomi, and Yakubu, and in five years, I want to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\u201d With this loan, she is well on her way to achieving this dream.

She is in a relationship and her partner works in masonry.  Both of them are responsible for supporting their 14-year-old son, who is in the eighth grade.  He is a very respectful and studious teenager.  <br \/><br \/>Cristina has a stand where she works and sells tortillas.  She has been in this trade for three years despite all of the efforts it took for her to get started.  Cristina is a woman who does not go about her work with a begrudging look on her face.  She says that all of her efforts are geared to contributing to the household income.  Cristina learned this trade as a child from her mother, who encouraged her to go down the good path of responsibility and hard work.  Her mother\u2019s efforts were not in vain because she raised an exemplary daughter.  Cristina was not involved in any other activities prior to establishing her tortilla stand.  She works with the help of a woman who was also looking for someone to assist her with making tortillas.  Cristina currently pays this employee to help her attend to all of the customers since there is already adequate demand.  No one else is involved in the business.  Her schedule begins at 3:00 A.M. when she has to wake up in order to prepare and grind the corn.  By 6:00 A.M., she has everything ready to make and sells tortillas.  She stops making sales at 1:00 P.M.  <br \/><br \/>The loan she is requesting will be used to buy 10 sacks of corn and a truckload of firewood, which will be a good investment.  The improvement that his loan will bring will enable her to buy sufficient supplies so that she can meet the existing demand.  She can accomplish this by purchasing her everyday supplies at wholesale.  <br \/><br \/>Her dreams include constantly growing her sales so that she can have more income.  As a result, she would be able to cover her needs and those of her family.

All of them are single and are responsible for eight young children among them.  They are originally from one of the towns in the northern part of the Department of Chinandega, which is in western Nicaragua.  This area is known for being productive in trade, livestock breeding, agriculture, and other sectors.  The members know one another very well because they are from the same area.  They decided to form a solidarity group so that they could help one another financially and invest in their different businesses.  <br \/><br \/>Julia Bertha is the coordinator of this solidarity group.  She is responsible for submitting the payments on time and in the correct manner.  Julia is a micro-entrepreneur and the manager of a bakery where she offers baked goods made from corn, puffed donuts, sweet bread, simple bread, pastries, basic cookies, candies, and other items.  She also buys and sells general merchandise such as new clothing, shoes, mobile phones, phone accessories, steel and silver plated goods, and other items.  In addition, Julia has a small store where she offers everyday consumer products such as rice, sugar, oil, frozen products, snack foods, sodas, juices, ramen soups, toilet paper, and other items.  She purchases her inventory with cash at the markets in her town and from distributors.  Her sales are conducted for cash or on credit.  She sells her products as a traveling vendor or from her home.  <br \/><br \/>One of her dreams is to see her children finish their studies and fully develop into professionals.  She also wants to increase her business and purchase a vehicle in the near future so that she can transport merchandise for fulfilling orders.  The purpose of her new loan is to invest it as working capital so that she can buy basic goods such as flour, lard, cheese, sugar, household products, and other items.  Thanks to the variety of products and good service that she offers to her customers, demand has grown.  Therefore, she needs more inventory for her businesses.  This will help her to satisfy the needs and demand of her customers.  <br \/><br \/>The solidarity group \u201cDios Es Amor\u201d is extremely grateful for the opportunity that the Kiva lenders have offered to people with limited financial

She has a small farm at home and, seasonally, she buys a large number of chicks that she raises for a three-month period until they are ready to be sold.  Then she sells them to merchants who visit her home.  She does the same thing with the pigs.  Maria has been involved in this business for many years and earning an income for the family.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy chicks, feed and medicine for the chickens and pigs.  She is a founding member of the communal bank and likes the help she receives from the group.  Her dream is to be prosperous.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1646966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chickens and feed and medicine for her chickens and pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-07-18T07:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-17T07:10:05Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":859.34,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":85.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":171.86,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541493},{"amount":175,"local_amount":171.86,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530024686},{"amount":174.99,"local_amount":171.86,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":174.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516792},{"amount":174.98,"local_amount":171.86,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":174.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562429331},{"amount":175.03,"local_amount":171.9,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":175.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579565023}],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T14:59:43Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:21:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":738213,"name":"Andrea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a widowed parent of eight children, Andrea works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a general store business in the Philippines and is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to purchase additional stocks like sardines, noodles, coffee, etc. to sell.\r\n\r\nShe successfully paid back her previous loan and now she has requested an additional loan to further build her business.\r\n\r\nAndrea has been sustaining her business activities through her past 22 loans from NWTF.

In spite of his tireless work, his meagre income does not provide the family with a decent lifestyle and he is unable to cover all the expenses.

She buys materials from the market and stitches the bags and sells them in the local market as well as in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nSelf-confident and supported by her family, Alima has successfully penetrated in the male-dominated business world.  She gets sufficient help and market knowledge from her husband. She knows that there is a great demand for her products (bags) in the market.\r\n\r\nShe is determined to succeed despite of the many challenges, and the greatest of them is lack of capital to expand her business.  So she has asked for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to overcome the problems.  She wants to purchase more raw materials for her business such as leather, cloth, gum, yarn, handles, buttons and other necessary items, and she will fully use the loan for that purpose.  She hopes the loan will enable her to reach to her goal to build up a bag manufacturing factory in the future.\r\n\r\nShe thanks her lenders (BJS and Kiva) for their financial support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1647146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase materials for her existing bag manufacturing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-07-18T14:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-17T14:50:08Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T15:41:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":737975,"name":"Maa Dhanalaxmi Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2014, 11 women from a village stepped out and formed a group called Maa Dhanalaxmi Self-Help Group in Odisha.

They were deprived of education due to the poor economic resources of their parents.\r\n\r\nMomina's husband is a laborer on a daily wages basis. His monthly earnings are scanty and unpredictable as his income depends on the daily income of his service.  Their eldest son also works as a daily laborer.  Due to the inconsistent income of Momina's husband and son, it was very difficult to make the both ends meet, and the family was facing acute financial crisis until Momina engaged herself in cattle breeding.  \r\n\r\nShe started the business by purchasing a dairy cow to give a financial assistance to her family.  She supplies milk to her neighbors, who are her main clients.  Her husband also helps her according to his convenience. Her business is a great financial support for the family.  Now with the growing expenses of a six-member family, she needs to expand her business.\r\n\r\nSo she has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase one dairy cow, which will provide more milk.  She hopes this will help her to avoid critical situations in the future and generate more income for the well being of her family.\r\n\r\nShe dreams to construct a decent and better house for them in the future.\r\n\r\nShe gives her thanks to both the generous lenders (BJS and Kiva).\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1647132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow for her dairy business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-07-18T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-17T15:00:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Momina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-18T15:16:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":738266,"name":"Riziki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riziki is married and has one child who is not in school.

","en":" Nuska is 29 years old and married, with two underage children. Nuska has received secondary education. She works as a janitor at the local school, but her salary is low, and she is forced to seek a supplementary source of income. Since 2007, Nuska has been raising livestock and growing farm produce, having started with a sum of 15,000 KGS. Thanks to Nuska's hard work, at present she owns one calf and one horse as well as 1.5 ha [3 acres] of land, where she grows potatoes, grains and sainfoin [a forage plant]. In order to develop her business further, Nuska has aplied to the Bai Tushum & Parnters microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 20,000 KGS to buy a cow. Nuska believes that buying a cow will allow her to receive more revenue from selling milk.

Noreen also volunteers with Camfed as a Learner Guide, leading weekly sessions on well-being and life skills to students at her local school.

However given that times are hard, he does not have any more capital to stock the shop; this is why he is asking FAPE KIVA for a loan, to be able to invest in his dream of having a bigger shop. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1646809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy edible products to sell in their shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Tecpan Guatemala,Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2014-07-18T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-17T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maycon Jordan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":581.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517538878},{"amount":75,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":581.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530021968},{"amount":75,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":581.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542513874},{"amount":74.88,"local_amount":561.62,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":580.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561647313},{"amount":75.12,"local_amount":563.38,"processed_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":581.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579561964},{"amount":74.88,"local_amount":561.62,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":580.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595159469},{"amount":75,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":581.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610555811},{"amount":75.12,"local_amount":563.38,"processed_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":581.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624454114}],"funded_date":"2014-07-26T16:35:16Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T11:21:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Claire Parsons","image":null}},{"id":733217,"name":"El Amanecer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En una comunidad de Oaxaca, la poblaci\u00f3n depende en gran parte del ingenio azucarero La Margarita, ya que este produce en promedio 102,712 toneladas de az\u00facar por zafra, y para dicha producci\u00f3n participan poco m\u00e1s de 2,400 personas de la regi\u00f3n.
