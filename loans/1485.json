She says that two years ago she was integrated into the group due to an invitation from a colleague that is a client of the institution. Now she has a business selling porridge. She actually began this business many years ago but was able to increase her sales by selling at the pavement.\n\nThis loan is so Suweba can buy millet and firewood to prepare porridge and sell to customers, and to eventually improve her retail space.

For the last seven years, Marina has worked hard to support herself, her husband, and her four nieces and nephews. Starting with a single taxi that she rented out, Marina has now expanded into a small business selling various sodas and home-made local drinks such as ginger juice, bissap juice (made from hibiscus leaves), and yogurt.  \r\n\r\nIn 2012, Marina discovered HOPE Congo and joined the community bank group Matondo (2). Marina is now on her seventh loan cycle with HOPE Congo and helps lead a sub-group of three other micro-entrepreneurs. She would like to take out a loan of 500,000 XAF (Central African CFA francs) to invest in her drink business and purchase additional juices and sodas to sell. Warm and welcoming with her clients, Marina hopes to one day move on from just selling drinks to traveling to Dubai and bringing back goods such as tiles to sell in Brazzaville.

Times were difficult during the past rainy season in Congo \u2013 not as many fish were available and those who sell in bulk raised their prices. Marie used her creativity to still keep customers by cutting her fish up into smaller, more manageable portions for people to buy, and charged lower prices than her competitors. \r\n\r\nAs a mother of three, Marie is constantly thinking of ways to improve her business so that she can take better care of her family. Since joining HOPE Congo in 2010, Marie is now on her 7th loan cycle with LA REUSSITE 2 (2). She would like to take out a small loan of 300,000 CFA to purchase additional dried fish to sell. Little by little, Marie hopes to increase her savings with higher profits.

She has taken a PHP 10,000 housing loan through NWTF in order to purchase materials to rebuild her family home and pay for construction labor.\r\n\r\nUrelyn is committed to rebuild her devastated life and in the future would like to save enough money to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":71,"image":{"id":1648352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Her aunt and uncle lost their children--both of their sons died. Katerina has four children, and she wanted to move in with her aunt to help support them. \r\n\r\nSince she moved in, she is like a daughter to them. Last year, her uncle had medical problems with his leg and now can't do much work on the plot, so Katerina and her aunt try to do all the work there. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the 15,000 UAH to invest in the construction of an additional greenhouse. This will be her second large greenhouse, which will also need a heating system installed. Katerina wants to invest the profits from the sale of products grown to complete the repairing the house where he lives with her family, redo the roof, and help her uncle with medical expenses to treat his leg."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1649011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to build a new greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-07-19T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-18T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":234.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katerina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1065.1,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":15211.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":234.9,"payment_id":579589213}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T16:30:18Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:43:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Max Prilutsky","image":1270958}},{"id":738836,"name":"Morita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Morita is 54 years old, married, and has five children.

Wira lives in a somewhat remote area and far from town. To go to school, he had a 5 km journey using public transportation or bus. \r\n\r\nWira is concerned that he can not achieve his dreams because of economic factors. His parent is a carpenter who makes household appliances such as cabinets, tables, chairs. His parents make every effort to help Wira achieve his goal as a sailor, but Wira is the second of seven children.

Asief lives in a somewhat remote village called Village Sadang, located in the Kudus city. To go to the old school, he had to travel 1 km on foot. Asief now lives with a stepmother who is only selling snacks in the house. Both biological parents have died. His mother died at the time of class 1 when Asief was still in elementary school, because of a heart attack. His father died when Asief was in class IX in junior high school, due to a throat infection. \r\n\r\nAsief has six siblings.

the mother of 12 children, 8 male and 4 female who are all now adults and have their own family. She is married; her husband makes a living in agriculture. She comments that with lots of work her husband and she have managed to raise their 12 children. The level of schooling that she has is fifth grade, as her parents didn't want to keep sending her to school, as to them it was enough that she had learned to read, so they sent her to graze the cattle that her father had and she didn't have time for school. \r\n\r\nNow in her home there only lives her husband, her youngest daughter and a granddaughter, and they are the only people who depend on her.\r\n \r\nNow that all of her children are older and married, she doesn't have another job other than domestic chores and taking care of her husband and granddaughter.  She comments that since she was little her mother taught her these activities so she does them perfectly, and when her children were little she had to work outside of the house to make an income, and the same with her husband who had to work very hard to support their 12 children. Now, 7 of them work abroad and they economically support her and her husband so they can do the farm work of cultivating maize and beans.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in remodeling her home, specifically in the construction of a kitchen as the one that she has doesn't meet the necessary conditions, and this rainy season water entered the house and soaked their belongings. She will buy 500 blocks, 15 bags of cement, 2 quintals of iron, 7 metres of sand, a truckload of stone and pay for labour. \r\n \r\nTeresa has dreams: she wants to continue to remodel for her grandchildren, having a well remodeled house. She also wants to leave the country and go to visit her children in the United States together with her husband, that her children will be good people along with her grandchildren, and to have better crops in her fields. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1014.47,"image":{"id":1648098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy 500 blocks, 15 bags of cement, 2 quintals of iron, 7 metres of sand, a truckload of stone and labour for the construction of a kitchen.

Life has not been that good, but he has always managed to put food on the table for his family. \r\n\r\nPeterson's primary sources of income are tea, other crops and small businesses.Being still young all his nine children are still in school and that is why he has to work extra hard so that he can  pay  tuition fees for his children. Peterson believes that education is the key to success and that is why he wants to give all his children that education. For this reason he is seeking a loan of KES 31,200 to be able to purchase a dairy cow that will be of great help to him in terms of generating more income.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan he will be able to sell milk to his neighbors and the village around, where demand for milk is so high. This loan will be of much help and will help him educate his nine children and be able to give them a brighter future through education.\r\n\r\nPeterson\u2019s projections are that after a short period he will be able to increase the number of dairy cows that he has and be able to comfortably repay the loan.

She projects that by the end of the year the goat will have given birth to at least four other goats. Through goat keeping, she will be able to get goat milk, which is very expensive and fetches high profits. This translates to more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also she will be able to sell goat meat and goat skin, which will increase her income level. The profits will be used to repay the loan on time and expand her business. \r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1648578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a goat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-19T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-18T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilhah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":714.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":741.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":753.29},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":780.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":794.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":816.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":852.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":860.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":887.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":908.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":934.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":957.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.73,"local_amount":1658.1,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1817.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547552},{"amount":19.29,"local_amount":1543.29,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1691.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624820},{"amount":10.43,"local_amount":834.57,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":914.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193892},{"amount":21.06,"local_amount":1684.44,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1846.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261833},{"amount":22.43,"local_amount":1794.48,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1967.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600091},{"amount":22.31,"local_amount":1879.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2059.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.18,"payment_id":681376960},{"amount":6.93,"local_amount":606.06,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":664.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.64,"payment_id":711505065}],"funded_date":"2014-07-19T22:40:05Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":738983,"name":"Keren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Keren lives in Masindi, Uganda.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nKatlyn dreams of having a bigger store and hopes to give her child a good life and education.

Meet Teresa, a caring 24-year-old mother and a darling to her four children and family. She lives in Nyamira area of Kenya, an area known for banana planting and their staple food, \u201cmatoke\u201d, which is made from bananas. She has been doing farming for the past twelve years, and she enjoys every bit of it. Through tea, crops and personal business, she has been able to earn a decent income and be able to provide for her young family.\r\n\r\nAlthough Teresa has been practicing farming for the past twelve years, she has always faced one uphill task, and that is inadequate capital to improve her farming. Due to this condition, she is requesting a loan of KES 20,800 to purchase a dairy cow, which will help in milk production. She will be able to sell products from milk, such as yoghurt.\r\n\r\nTeresa has an entrepreneur\u2019s mind, and this has helped her to be able to identify a market for milk and milk products in her area. Through this, she will be able to earn more money, and this will translate into improved living standards for her family.\r\n\r\nTeresa\u2019s projections are that through the profits she would be making, she will be able to save enough money to be able to one day open a yoghurt-making plant. Through the profits earned, Teresa will be able to comfortably repay the loan without any trouble.\r\n

He lives with his family in Sana'a, Yemen. He is an educated man. Recently, he has been an employee in the public sector. Over time, Mohammed was able to save a good amount of money from his salary and purchased a bus to work as a driver to transport people from one station to another to earn money in order to improve the living standards of his family. He has been in this business for many years. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of what he earns from this business goes to the repair of the bus. The repair of the bus costs him a lot of money. His taxi became very old and needs weekly repairing, but Mohammed doesn't have enough money to do that. For this reason, he applied for a loan of 150,000 YER (Yemeni Rials) from AMB (Al-Amal Microfinance Bank) in order to buy spare parts for the bus and change its machine. These new spare parts will help him to save a lot of money.\r\n\r\nMohammed's vision is to repair this bus and sell it in order to purchase a new one in place of the first bus.

She works in selling ice cream and some kinds of sandwiches in the streets under sunshine to the schoolchildren. She decided to work in this humble business in order to help her husband in covering the expenses of the family. Most of what she earns goes to the expenses of the family. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she applied for a loan of 20,000 YER from AMB. She will use the loan to buy ice cream materials as sugar and other materials in order to make the ice cream and sell it, and in this way, she will increase her working capital and improve her business. Her reason for applying for this loan is lack of capital. She faces many challenges in her business, including increasing her client base, and she will use the profits to improve the quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nFozia looks forward to expanding her business through opening a stall for selling ice cream and children's sweets. She hopes to provide her children with a secure future.
