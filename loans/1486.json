She lives with her family in a remote village (Madhya Boragari in Jalpaiguri district).\r\n\r\nMira's husband, 38-year-old Raman, is associated with land cultivation. He started this farm business 10 years ago and it has now been the principal source of income. His wife has been his right hand and together they fight to give their family better living conditions. Every morning, fresh air caresses the face of Mira and her husband who with much energy, want to analyze the conditions of their crops. They always make sure that the vegetables that they grow (such as potatoes, beans, gourds, and eggplant are fit to be consumed and they are very concerned with the wellbeing of their customers.\r\n\r\nMira is now requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) in order to increase their capital production. They want to cultivate paddy, which is a very profitable and all-season crop. She needs to purchase agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers, manure and other necessary things to start cultivation as early as possible.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to her lenders for the loan, which will make it possible for her to earn better income to cover the costs of the family.  She hopes that her crop yields will be good.

She's a hardworking and energetic woman who is always looking for alternatives that allow her to progress.\r\n\r\nFor some ten years, she's earned her living working in the clothing field, a job she learned empirically by observing an aunt. Little by little, she perfected her technique and increased her knowledge through practice. \r\n\r\nThis prompted her to start her own workshop, for which she improved a space in the house she lives in. With some savings she had, she bought her first machines. She works alone every day, but sometimes receives help from another person, depending on the number of contracts she has. Through this, she's succeeded in earning enough to pay for household expenses. \r\n\r\nThe loan she's seeking is support for is to strengthen her work. With the money, she will buy a serger (a type of sewing machine) and a tabletop sewing machine. With these machines, she will be able to streamline the production process and get more contracts, generating better profitability in the business.\r\n\r\nLuz says her biggest challenge is competition in the market. However, it's that which continues motivating her to continue offering a better service and fighting to make her dream of accrediting her business a reality. This will allow her to generate employment opportunities and thus improve her quality of life, and those of the people affecting the work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1648255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Through funds from these ventures she has been able to take care of her family's basic needs and always puts a smile on her child.

Phanice has been doing farming for the past year and has never regretted even a single bit, venturing into farming because of the profits she has been making.\r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum, and for this reason she is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to start poultry farming. Through this loan she will be able to combine profits that she will get and improve her living conditions and those of her family.\r\n\r\nPhanice wants to secure the future of her child that is why she will do anything good to be able to realize that dream. Phanice is sure that through the profits she will be reaping she will comfortably pay the loan and even ask for more money so that she will improve her life and give her child a solid

Meet Jackline, who is 34 years of age and hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area that has good weather patterns that favor farming. Jackline is a kind, loving mother of two children and has been farming for the last two years. Due to the good weather patterns that are experienced in Nyamira, Jackline has been able to practice mixed farming--that is, dairy farming and crop farming. Through these ventures Jackline has been able to support her family and always put food on the table. Jackline is very proud of farming and cherishes every moment that she is on her farm.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jackline has been making profits, not everything has been rosy. There are challenges that she is facing on her farm and in her life because of inadequate finances. Jackline is seeking a loan of 50,000 KES to be able to start banana farming. Coming from a region where the cash crop is bananas and everybody grows bananas, Jackline wants to take advantage of the good weather patterns experienced there and the demand for bananas and turn that dream into more cash.\r\n\r\nBecause of the increasing client base and market, Jackline is sure that she will reap more profits and be able to provide for her family and ensure a secure future for her two adorable kids. More profits will translate to a flourishing business and hence she will be able to increase and start other business ventures through the accumulated profits. Jackline has gone through the repayment schedule and is very comfortable with the payments, and she is sure that through the accumulated profits from selling bananas she will impact the society. \r\n\r\nJackline feels relieved to know that there are people and institutions that support and generate opportunities to progress and for this reason she is very optimistic that the loan will be of much help and she will progress in life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1648773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start banana farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-20T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-19T04:40:06Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3140.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3703.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3840.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3906.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4042.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4120.59},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4231.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4405.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4464.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4596.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4708.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4839.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.51,"local_amount":3783.34,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3815.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054365},{"amount":44.57,"local_amount":3875.41,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3908.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547553},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":2767.16,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2790.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680536},{"amount":10.77,"local_amount":936.51,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":944.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823367},{"amount":8.71,"local_amount":757.62,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":764.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261834},{"amount":0.52,"local_amount":45.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636263971},{"amount":12.33,"local_amount":1072.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1081.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600092},{"amount":377.94,"local_amount":34613.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34909.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.12,"payment_id":681376961},{"amount":23.09,"local_amount":2148.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.62,"payment_id":731024365}],"funded_date":"2014-07-20T14:09:29Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":739151,"name":"Karine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karine lives in Jermuk town of Vayots Dzor village with her husband, parents and 22-year-old son.

Karine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have bad credit history behind them and have no access to credit products. With the loan's help, she is planning to buy 15 bee colonies with hives and pesticides.

Every morning Zahara makes tea, which her husband carries in a pot to the local railway station.  His main customers are the train passengers and passersby. This small business is the main source of income for the family, which hardly covers even the food expenses. So, the family is in an acute financial crisis. He purchases stock for his business from the wholesale sellers three times a week.  Due to a lack of sufficient money, he has to purchase items on a regular basis, which unnecessarily increases costs in both finance and labor.  Zahara and her husband want to increase their stock of products such as tea leaves, sugar, milk and other items to expand the business for more income. But their main challenge is capital.\r\n\r\nHearing from her neighbors that BJS gives business loans to rural women, Zahara took a loan from them to purchase the required items for their business.

She's grateful to God above all for her daily life and health to strive and get ahead with her family.\r\n\r\nIn her childhood, she did not get an opportunity to get an education due to the poor financial resources of her parents.  So she is earnestly trying to provide an education for her sons. She and her husband, age 46, are engaged in farm labor such as weeding, caring for the crop, and other tasks before harvesting the crops.  They cultivate different vegetables in different seasons.  With several years of experience in farm work, they have been able to get ahead despite the difficulties that have arisen along the way including the rising costs of inputs and the instability of the prices for buying and selling vegetables. Now that her sons have grown up and the family expenses are increasing day by day, they feel the need to further improve their agricultural activities.  They have decided to cultivate paddy, which is an all-season crop and the staple food of the regional people in much demand throughout the year. So, they think it will be a profitable business that will earn more income.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Baijanti is requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers etc. to start cultivation. She has a lot of faith and hope of getting ahead, because her household expenses depend on this work.\r\n\r\nHer dream as a mother is to prepare her sons so they will be prosperous people in life.

She has three children (one son and two daughters), all of whom are students.  Two are in different grades in local school and the other one is in college.  They live in the small village of Baroghoria in the district of Jalpaiguri.  She finished primary education with a lot of effort and support from her parents.\r\n\r\nBina's husband Mophijar, age 45, is engaged in agricultural activities.  He mainly grows paddy.  Bina helps her husband in different jobs every day to keep their crops healthy, which is an arduous and difficult job that is worthwhile at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nHer family's income depends on this agribusiness. Her husband has many years of experience in this job, which he learned from his father.  The land is his own, an inheritance from his parents.

Anarkul has a secondary-specialized education and works as a cook at a local kindergarten. Anarkul also receives a pension due to her health condition. However, the earnings from the work and pension are not enough to support the family. After the death of her husband, when the family was left in a troubled situation, Anarkul had to support the family on her own and find an additional source of income, and became involved in animal husbandry and farming. Today, Anarkul's business contains 1 cow, 1 bull, 10 sheep and 4 horses, and also has a 6.00 hectare land plot, where Anarkul grows potatoes, cereal crops and sainfoin. Thanks to her hard work, today Anarkul earns an average monthly profit of 13,000 som (KGS) from sales of agricultural products, fruits, vegetables and milk. The children actively help her with the household, both with sales and running the business. In order to further develop her business, Anarkul requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock. Anarkul plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her business in order to save money to buy a house in a resort area; she has a dream of getting involved in a tourism business in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":870,"image":{"id":1649262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Shapak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-20T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-19T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":51.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":386.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":773.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.16,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.17,"payment_id":579489147},{"amount":268.28,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":15015.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.72,"payment_id":624799043},{"amount":358.64,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20020.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.03,"payment_id":696500027}],"funded_date":"2014-07-22T07:51:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":738733,"name":"Alva Colorina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alva de 32 a\u00f1os de edad es madre soltera y vive con sus 3 hijos de 14, 11 y 7 a\u00f1os de edad.

She started this when she wanted to raise school fees for her younger sister who was being kicked out of school because she was unable to pay the school fees. Since she is the eldest in the family Agnes took over the motherly roles after her parents passed. She moves from one community to the other advertising and selling her kapenta\/ matemba (dried sardines). She also is a voluntary preschool teacher at the local primary school, and is a Camfed Learner Guide at the local secondary school.  With the Kiva loan, Agnes will buy more supplies and fish to sell at her shop.

Most of the population is of Maya K'iche' descent and most are small farmers who grow corn and beans as well as wheat. Some raise animals like goats and sheep. The wool is used to fabricate warm wool blankets, quite useful in the cool climate of the area. \r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cJard\u00edn\u201d meaning \u201cGarden\u201d is located here and consists of twelve indigenous women, three of whom are new to the group. They are about to begin a new Loan Cycle and are quite hopeful that they will continue to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nLeonarda, the 32-year-old Secretary of the group, has had five years of formal education. She is a single parent, raising two children, and works diligently every day to meet their current and future needs. One of her children is in primary school which makes her very happy. Leonarda has an animal husbandry business and is requesting a loan which she will use to purchase chickens and goats. With the income that she will realize, Leonarda will be able to pay for the family\u2019s  necessities including food and education.\r\n\r\nApproximately one-half of the women in the Trust Bank are unable to read and write. Realizing this, Friendship Bridge combines the small loans with educational seminars a combination called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. A Loan Officer from the organization meets with the Trust Bank each month and the ladies acquire basic business and personal tools that are useful to them. For example, to help them with their loans, the women learn about effective business practices including budgeting, accounting, pricing, marketing, customer service and indebtedness. To support them in their personal lives, the ladies learn about nutrition, health, hygiene and self esteem.\r\n\r\nAt the end of their last meeting, the twelve women, with hopeful smiles on their faces, expressed their appreciation to KIVA investors for funding their loans. They have promised to work hard and to be responsible. Thank you, KIVA investors, from the \u201cJard\u00edn\u201d Trust Bank in Momostenango,

The business sells women's, men's and children's shoes in the local market. She has a lot of experience and knows all the intricacies of her business. \r\n\r\nDespite her capabilities, the powerful competition among businesses causes her to be attentive and requires that she update her inventory every season.

He's single and lives in Pachacamac with his family.\r\n\r\nHe has worked as a press assistant in a prestigious business for almost a year.  It's going very well for him because he's a hardworking, responsible, and honest person with a great desire for self-improvement.\r\n\r\nHis biggest motivation in life is his family, for whom he strives every day to be able to give a better quality of life and a better future.  Pool is grateful to the Kiva lenders because with their support he'll be able to buy himself a mobile phone.  He lost his old one and doesn't have a way to communicate with his family.\r\n\r\nThanks to this support he'll be able to communicate with his parents when he's working and they won't worry.  That way, Pool will keep on making an effort so in the future he can achieve his big dream of having his own business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1648286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

The place is surrounded by green fields thanks to the agriculture that its residents practice. They also raise animals and work as merchants. They maintain their cultures and traditions and their architecture is a mixture of old and new. The members have a common goal, which is to get ahead with their families and offer their children a better future. The loans help them grow their businesses little by little and they are proud of their achievements.\r\n \r\nOne of the members of the group is Tania. She is a friendly and kind member of the Cochapamba credit group and she likes the loan method because of the unity and solidarity between the members. She also likes the advice from the life experience of the older members. This helps her get ahead.  \r\n\r\nTania is 22 years old. She is the single mother of a 3 year old child. She lives in her parents' house and shares the household expenses. Tania spends most of her time at home caring for her young daughter, but to contribute to the household budget she raises animals and farms. She really likes this activity because it allows her to be independent and also generate income for the home.  \r\n\r\nThe money from the previous loan was invested in buying animals and the new loan will be to buy chickens and guinea pigs. This activity is going very well for her and she hopes to keep growing this business little by little. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4625,"image":{"id":1648313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chickens, guinea pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-07-20T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-19T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":4625,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Aidee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jenny Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4614.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":576.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":576.78},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":576.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":576.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":576.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":576.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":576.78},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":576.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":578.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":578.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":578.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":578.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":578.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":578.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":578.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":578.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":578.13,"local_amount":576.78,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T11:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":578.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517541502},{"amount":1156.26,"local_amount":1153.56,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530024695},{"amount":1156.26,"local_amount":1153.56,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516801},{"amount":1734.35,"local_amount":1730.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1734.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562429340}],"funded_date":"2014-07-21T01:08:22Z","paid_date":"2014-11-20T10:40:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":738771,"name":"Maria Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal KUSI CCOYLLOR, el banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Vilcabamba, provincia de La Convenci\u00f3n y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia Maria Magdalena se dedica al negocio de venta de comida, la socia realiza diferentes platos como pollo al horno, sopas y saltados de carne, la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 6:00 p.m,la socia ya tiene 8 a\u00f1os en este negocio y le va muy bien, el sue\u00f1o de la socia es tener un restaurant.

","en":"Illeish is from Beregovo. He works as a handyman installing flooring. Illeish is very handy around the house, and can do a lot with his hands. Because of the recent events in his country, he is having a hard time and does not have enough  work orders. However, Illeish does not dismay and hasn't given up--instead, he decided to temporarily keep busy with another sort of business.\r\n\r\nIlleish owns a single story house with 5 rooms. But the house has paint that is aging, plaster that is falling apart in some places, and windows and doors that provide no insulation. Illeish has wanted to improve the living conditions in his home for a long time, so he decided to take advantage of financial aid from Kiva.  He wants to use the 40,000 UAH to invest in puttying and plastering the walls and ceiling, as well as replacing the entrance doors and two windows."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1809.63,"image":{"id":1649702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

","en":"Svetlana lives and works in Novaya Kohovka. She sells women's sportswear in the local market, renting her stall from the market's administration, which has enabled many small businesses here that cannot yet afford to buy their own stores. Svetlana has been running her business for 19 years. Currently her main products are T-shirts, sweaters, shorts and sports suits.\r\n\r\nWith the 31,000 hryvnia from Kiva, Svetlana plans to buy jackets, vests, pants, and warm outfits for the coming autumn and winter seasons. Having sufficient retail experience, quality merchandise and competitive prices, as well as an interest in the field, Svetlana plans to continue her business into the future, and grow the business to provide for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1649709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

for its mild climate and for being an agricultural area where corn, wheat, beans, peaches and coffee are grown. It is here that seven women have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Rosas de Pabeya\u201d meaning \u201cThe Roses of Pabeya\u201d. They are about to begin their second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. The ladies are engaged in various endeavors including textile production, animal husbandry, and commercial sales (clothing, etc.)\r\n\r\nPascuala is a newer member of the Trust Bank. She is 23 years of age and unmarried. She has been elected Treasurer of the group because of her ability to speak and write in Spanish. Pascuala is a very talented textile artisan and learned how to embroider when she was quite young. When she saw how her small business would benefit from an influx of capital, she joined the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank. Pascuala is requesting a loan to purchase different colors of embroidery thread, and an embroidery rack. She wants to be certain to have enough materials on hand to create her textile treasures and increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nAs most of the women of the Trust Bank are illiterate, they are appreciative of the educational component of their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares information on basic life skills including the use of medicinal plants, health, nutrition, hygiene and self-esteem. The women learn how to manage their businesses with new knowledge about budgeting, indebtedness, accounting, customer service, pricing and marketing. This combination of small loans and education is what the organization calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of all the women in the Trust Bank \u201cLas Rosas de Pabeya\u201d,  Pascuala thanks Kiva investors for granting them these essential loans. In her own words, \"We appreciate the help of Friendship Bridge and its partners like Kiva because they trust us to wisely invest in our businesses, generate more income, and improve our lives. It means a lot to be able to take care of our families with the money we make and meet our monthly expenses.\u201d "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1649146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase different colors of embroidery thread and an embroidery rack.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nahual\u00e1, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2014-07-20T15:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-19T15:20:01Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca Angelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2126},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2126},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2126},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2126},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2126},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2126},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2126},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2118}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275.13,"local_amount":2126,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530023456},{"amount":275.13,"local_amount":2126,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542515557},{"amount":275.13,"local_amount":2126,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649094},{"amount":275.13,"local_amount":2126,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579563945},{"amount":275.13,"local_amount":2126,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595161324},{"amount":275.13,"local_amount":2126,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610557848},{"amount":275.13,"local_amount":2126,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624230989},{"amount":274.09,"local_amount":2118,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216721}],"funded_date":"2014-07-20T21:50:15Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:35:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":739406,"name":"Flores De Panimache Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Panimach\u00e9 meaning \u201cthe place of the big tree\u201d is a small rural community in Chichicastenango, Guatemala. The population of the area speak \u201ckiche\u201d which is a Mayan language and very few speak Spanish. The community is a poor one and it is very evident that living conditions need to be improved. The eight women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cFlores de Panimache\u201d or \u201cFlowers of Panimache\u201d realize that they can empower themselves and make a difference in economic situation of their families. They have formed several small businesses. Some work in the production of handicrafts and traditional textiles while others work in animal husbandry and raise chickens, turkeys, pigs and cattle. \r\n\r\nThe group is starting its first loan cycle and each of the young women, who average 28 years of age, is most excited. Catalina is the 19-year-old Secretary of the Trust Bank who recently married. She lives with her husband\u2019s family as is common in Guatemalan indigenous culture, especially in rural areas. Catalina anticipates having her own family and has a vision of a healthy and educated one, living in different conditions from the ones she grew up in. Catalina sells chickens once each week in a small local market. She wants to make a little extra income and sell a few more days each week. She is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase additional live chickens, fatten them up, butcher them and sell more meat. She looks forward to attracting new customers, increasing her income and saving some money to get ready to take care of her yet unborn children.\r\n\r\nThe women of the \u201cFlores de Panimach\u00e9\u201d Trust Bank are most excited thinking about the possibilities that will come with their first loans. They have been participating in the educational training program of Friendship Bridge at their monthly meetings. A Loan Officer facilitates this part of the meetings and the ladies enhance their leadership skills, participate in group discussions and practice teamwork techniques. They discuss topics such as women\u2019s health, self-esteem and leadership. They learn about women\u2019s rights and violence against women. To help them with their loans and small businesses, they learn about business management and administration, budgeting, accounting and marketing. Finally, the ladies learn about the use of medicinal plants and nutrition. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and educational trainings \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a poor indigenous woman in Guatemala to walk into a bank and secure a loan.

He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of cotton thread.\r\n\r\nFrancisco has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is his story:\r\n\r\nFrancisco learned how to weave from his parents. \r\n\r\n\"My parents started out as farmers and then learned to weave.

One is in grade 7 and the other is in the university and doing a Masters degree in Arts. Their eldest son is engaged in agricultural activities with his father.

He toils hard all day long on his agricultural land with the help of his son and sells the produce in the local markets.  But their earnings are not sufficient to cover all the necessary expenses of the family. So Aloka and her husband have decided to cultivate tea plants on their farmland as they have enough cultivable land, which they want to use to grow other crops for additional income. They have chosen this crop because it is a profitable crop and the climate in their region is suitable for this crop.\r\n\r\nIn order to start cultivation, Aloka applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase good quality saplings and fertilizers. Her goals are to be able to continue increasing her tea crops to diversify her income in order to not to be dependent on one sole income and to continue supporting her children with their studies so that they can be successful and make progress with their goals, hopes and dreams.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1649322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural supplies for cultivating tea plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-07-20T21:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-19T21:40:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aloka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-20T23:22:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":739192,"name":"Oscar Abel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar es un joven emprendedor, tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y vive en Guadalupe junto a su familia.\nEs una persona con muchas ganas de salir adelante, actualmente estudia la carrera profesional de administraci\u00f3n en un Instituto y le va muy bien puesto que es una persona muy inteligente y estudiosa.\nTambi\u00e9n desde hace casi un a\u00f1o trabaja como vendedor en una reconocida tienda, le va muy bien porque es muy responsable, trabajador y sobre todo porque siempre es respetuoso y amable con los clientes.\nOscar est\u00e1 agradecido con los prestamistas Kiva porque con el apoyo que le han brindado \u00e9l podr\u00e1 hacer algunos arreglos a su domicilio como pintarrajear las paredes, de esta manera estar\u00e1 mejorando la calidad de vida de su familia, vivir\u00e1n con mayores comodidades y seguir\u00e1 esforz\u00e1ndose para m\u00e1s adelante: \"convertirse en un gran profesional\".","en":"Oscar is a young, enterprising person.

Meet Daniel, who is 25 years old, very ambitious, hardworking and very humble. Daniel hails from the Kitale area of Kenya--a place that is very fertile and is the \u201cbread basket of Kenya.\u201d Being raised in a humble background has nurtured Daniel to have humility and patience in life.  Daniel started farming two years ago and has been making a lot of profits.\r\nBeing still young and single, most of the profits that he gets through farming Daniel invests in his farm and uses the rest to support his parents. Daniel never got the chance to further his education because of a lack of funds but that did not deter him from achieving his goal of succeeding in life.\r\nDaniel practices mixed farming and also runs a small business to make ends meet. He is so determined to succeed in life and he wants to gather more profits so that he can lay a solid foundation for his family. Daniel sells the fruits of his labor to the nearby markets within his area but because of poor feeder roads and a poor road network, Daniel has been experiencing a challenge transporting his products to the market. Most of the products such as milk and vegetables require that Daniel take them to the market quickly while they are still fresh so that he can get maximum profits, but Daniel has been facing the challenge of timely delivery of the products due to the roads.  \r\nThat is why he is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES to purchase a motorbike that will be of great help to him.  With the motorbike, Daniel will be able to deliver milk and vegetables to the market on time and increase his profits. Daniel is sure that through the increased profits, he will be able to repay the loan on time, provide good living conditions for his family and also impact society positively."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":693.54,"image":{"id":1649349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

This training course was offered through social programs administered by the municipal government.  Ada lacks a formal education because her family has very limited financial resources.  <br \/><br \/>Her family consists of her grandmother, her husband, and her seven-year-old daughter who is attending a school in their community for her basic education.  Ada has four years of experience working as a stylist in her community.  She learned the business while participating in a course that was given in her town.  Ada also depends on remittances that her husband sends from the United States.  <br \/><br \/>The money from this loan will be used to buy a refrigerator so that she can set up a mini-market in the area where she provides haircuts and styling services.  This will give her another source of income that she can invest in improving her business.

She is 47 years old, smart and talented. She works hard to support her family, even though she is still a single mother with three children. \r\n\r\nIn order to support herself and reduce the family\u2019s financial worries, she took the initiative to sell fresh fish in the town market. She gets her supplies from the fishermen at a wholesale price and sells to customers at a retail price.\r\n \r\nEsther says she has been doing this business for the past eight years. She is very happy with the turnover she gets from the business. She wants to expand her business. The sales are high during the holidays, occasions and festive season, and also ordinary days because her products are consumable. \r\n\r\nEsther says the business is special to her because it makes her happy; her favorite part about being in this business is giving customer service and getting profits. She uses the income to manage the family's affairs, and she saves what is left with the MFI (micro finance institution).\r\n\r\nMost of the time, however, the poor power supply in the area hampers her work. It is difficult to work past sunset due to the poor power supply. Since she does not have any alternate source of power supply to rely on, she wants to take a Kiva solar loan to buy 45-watt solar lighting systems, each having four bulbs. Once the system is installed in her store, she will be able to open the shop past sunset or even at night hassle-free, and this will bring her more income and the ability to afford better living standards.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members also need solar loans for their income-generating activities. The other members are engaged in weaving, a variety store, a second-hand business and the like. Also, some of the group members have children, and they will be able to study in the evenings by the light of these solar systems."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1649462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

He left school so young because, when he was a boy, there were no schools near his home. The only school was in a town far from his house. He was only able to go to the first three years of school because he was able to stay with a friend of his father. As Margarito had to help his father with his work, he left school at the end of third grade.\r\n\r\nMargarito is married; his wife takes care of the household chores. The couple has two daughters, aged 24 and 22 years old each. The eldest is studying at university. The family lives together under one roof.\r\n\r\nMargarito makes a living in farming. He grows basic grains. Margarito says that when he was a boy, his father took him to work to learn about the crops. Margarito learned this trade and also worked with others in the field. This experience now helps Margarito to grow a harvest to give his family food to eat. Margarito says that he also works building adobe house. Margarito has a friend who used to build houses, and he taught him the trade. Margarito says he has many customers who give him contracts to build houses.
