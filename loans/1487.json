Meet Hanson, a 27-year-old, energetic, brave and humble man who hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya - an area that is very fertile and always receives plenty of rainfall. The major cash crop grown in the Nyamira area is banana, and that is why this region is nicknamed \u201cbanana region\u201d. \r\n\r\nHanson is a caring father of 3 adorable kids and he has been farming for the past 3 years. Through farming he has been able to take care of his children and family. Hanson also does business so that he can make ends meet and increase his profit levels. Through these ventures, he has always brought food back home and earned an honest living. He is a very hardworking man, and sells his produce in the market and also to his neighbors so that he is able to make more money. \r\n\r\nOne challenge that he is currently facing involves getting his products to the market on time. Because of the poor road network and poor feeder roads, the products are no longer fresh when they reach the market. This means that Hanson must sell them at a throw-away price, hence not getting maximum profit. Products such as milk, fruit and vegetables require a timely delivery to market, and for this reason Hanson is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to buy a motorbike that will assist him in getting his products to market faster. He is sure of reaping more profit because his products will be fresh and will fetch more money. \r\n\r\nWith improved profits, Hanson will be able to assure his children of a brighter future and also improve his living conditions. Having gone through and understood the repayment schedule, he is sure that he will be able to repay the loan on time and increase his business in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1649606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

","en":"Vasiliy lives in Vodyanoye with his wife and three daughters. For ten years, he has been growing tomatoes and cucumbers on his own land.  He has two large heated greenhouses and a separate greenhouse for seedlings. Since childhood, Vasiliy has worked the earth. After serving in the army he worked at a factory for two years. But he still went back to farming which is more to his liking. Vasiliy's farm is always in order. Vasiliy plans to invest 40,000 hyrvinia in greenhouse repair, repairing heating systems, and buying film and the right seeds for the season. Over time, he plans install a good heating system for the greenhouses as well as raising the greenhouses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1649730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"construct

Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. As soon as the ten women finished paying off their previous loan, they immediately applied for another one. They hope that it will be funded by Kiva lenders. The ladies are most eager to continue to invest in their small businesses, so that they can meet the needs of their families. Most work in textile production and create beautiful pieces of embroidery, by hand and machine. These pieces are sewn into aprons, blouses and purses.<br \/><br \/>Carmelina is a member of the Trust Bank. She is 36 years of age and married to a bricklayer. The couple has four children, and three of them are enrolled in school. Carmelina has a small convenience store that she keeps stocked with items for daily consumption. She is requesting a new loan that she will use to purchase inventory, including rice, noodles, sugar, butter, oil, juices and soda. She opens her store at 7 a.m. and stays open until 9 p.m. She said that her previous loan helped her to maintain and increase her business. This hard-working woman is positive that she can do even better. The income that Carmelina generates greatly helps her to improve the standard of living for the family, and to support her children\u2019s education.<br \/><br \/>The women of the Trust Bank Guadalupe Uno are happy to report that they enjoy the monthly trainings given by a Friendship Bridge loan officer. They learn about business administration, money management, marketing and, in the last three months, they have discussed topics like empowerment and domestic violence, as well as children\u2019s education. This group is very active and likes to participate during the training sessions. This helps to them gain confidence in themselves and raise their self-esteem! <br \/><br \/>The women of Guadalupe Uno would like to thank Kiva lenders, for their kindness and generosity in providing capital for the loans. They are most appreciative of the confidence that the lenders have in their ability to improve their lives. They look forward to a brighter future, as empowered women eliminating poverty!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5300,"image":{"id":1649848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

members of the women\u2019s bank have been very responsible with their commitment of payment.  They confronted a special situation within their group where a partner did not pay her share on time and they assumed her payments until the final month.  They made the decision to refine the group, leaving behind the members that they considered to be a risk. \r\n\r\nThe group is located in a rural area in which there are large problems with sources of employment.  They all used to work in an assembly factory in Tucurrique, but due to poor economic conditions, it closed, leaving the community without opportunities for jobs.  This forced the women to support their household budgets by generating income from the sale of textile products they created.  They now devote themselves to sewing and fabricating various products.  This new loan is very important to the associates since they already have plans to carry out the development of production. \r\n\t\r\nFor this group of three women, this is the third loan they have received.  They have equipment and sell their products in both Cartago and Turrialba, which are cities close to their homes.  With the previous loans, they have bought raw materials.  This is their third loan request, and they hope to continue to grow, as well as to support their children\u2019s studies.\r\n\t\r\nZelmira, the president of the group, has two daughters that are in school and live with her husband.  She is dedicated to making curtains, pillows and blankets that are sold in the cities previously mentioned.  She has 20 years of experience working with sewing machines and her products are of very high quality.  She supports her children\u2019s studies and contributes money for household expenses in addition to investing in the business.

accessories, and for the maintenance of their jeepney. Her earnings were a big help in their personal, household and business expenditures. She has had this business for more than thirty years now and she has six jeepneys.\r\n\r\nShe would now like to apply for a 40,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of their jeepney. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to cover her family's daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAs of the moment, God has  blessed her and her family so much that she can say that she is content with what she has now. She is hoping though that her grandchildren will have a good future too. She meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers who helped the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney \u2013 open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1506199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for spare parts and the maintenance of their jeepney.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-07-21T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-20T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marceline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":246.68,"local_amount":10666.68,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T09:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10775.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517517319},{"amount":246.68,"local_amount":10666.68,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10775.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000284},{"amount":246.66,"local_amount":10666.68,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10775.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491806},{"amount":184.98,"local_amount":7999.96,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8081.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561624996}],"funded_date":"2014-07-21T22:25:35Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":740034,"name":"Ryan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ryan is a 27-year-old single dad.

She is a married mother of four children, three of whom are in school and one of whom is too young for schooling. To strive for a living, she grows rice and does paid work to earn extra income. She has been involved in this business for 11 years and it earns 27,900 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nIncluding this cycle, Rin is a seventh-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has fully paid back her past loans successfully and she is leading three members to get a new loan.

She provides a manicure service. She has been involved in this business for 9 years. She leases her work space. Olesya has a 13-year-old daughter, whom she is raising on her own because she is divorced from her husband. It was difficult for Olesya to get back on her feet after the divorce because she had to carry all of the responsibilities by herself and never asked for support from her daughter's father.\r\n\r\nOlesya plans to invest the 40 000 hryvnia loan obtained from Kiva into developing a new business area that, in her opinion, would help create a more sustainable income for the family. She wants to open a store to sell women's clothing and needs money to buy the merchandise. Olesya thinks that a stable income from different sources would help her to safeguard her family and provide her and her daughter with all of the

The oldest son lives and works in Russia, and the younger children live with Zhamila and her husband. Zhamila has a secondary education and neither she nor husband are officially employed because it is very difficult to find work in the village, but it is necessary to support the family and raise the children. This is why Zhamila has been involved in agriculture since 2004. Today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 bull, 15 sheep and 1 horse. She also has a 1.00 hectare owned land and 1.00 hectare of leased land, where Zhamila and her husband grow potatoes and sainfoin. Zhamila's husband is also involved in preparing and selling firewood to local bakeries. He cuts the wood manually in canyon, places it in bags and then drives them by horse for many kilometers to the village. Zhamila also sells milk to local residents. However, the monthly income amounts to only 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Zhamila requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock in order to increase livestock headcount and to first buy a cow to increase obtained milk volumes. Zhamila plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of domestic livestock quantities and provision of decent education for her children. Zhamila also wants to build a barn for the livestock."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025.07,"image":{"id":1650143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She makes a living making bread, and works only with one industrial oven, which is installed in a room in her home.\r\n\r\nMartha is a hard-working woman, strong and determined. Her working hours start at dawn, when everyone is asleep. She kneeds the dough for her bread, bakes the loaves, then she stores them in baskets until she has filled her daily order. Once she is finished baking her entire production, she sets out with her full baskets to deliver some orders to friendly neighborhood stores, then to the market where she finishes selling the remaining loaves.\r\n\r\nHer daily life is the bread-making routine, which she shares with her family. She wants to expand her business by purchasing a dough kneading machine. Her production will be faster with the machine, being able to produce larger quantities in shorter times. With that improvement she will be able to help her family and will obtain better earnings. Therefore, Martha requests a loan to buy a bread kneading machine, in order to help her family with the

They live in their own kachha house (made of straw, mud and bamboo) in Khagrabari in Jalpaiguri district.\r\n\r\nBina's husband is a cycle-van puller. It is a mode of transport that is widely used in rural areas of West Bengal for carrying people and loads. He has endured many a hardship due to their poor economic condition. He has had to do many odd jobs to save money to buy a cycle-van, which he uses to carry goods and people to the local markets, nearest railway station and to other villages. But due to over usage, it has been damaged severely, and as a result, his income has been affected a lot. His economic opportunities can be much improved by a loan that will enable him to purchase a new van.\r\n\r\nSo, to help her husband, Bina has asked for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to buy a new cycle-van in order to improve her husband's business and provide better services to their customers.

lives in Kapsabet, a small town near Kakamega County.

It has one of the highest rural population densities in the world (in some areas, close to 600 people per square kilometer), which may contribute to the region's high poverty rates.\r\n\r\nJoyce is married and has eight children. She is a business lady, and she undertakes farming with her husband. They have been farming for forty years now, and they are currently growing sweet potatoes and tea on their farm. Joyce is excited about beekeeping, as it will earn her some income from the sale of honey.\r\n\r\nThis is Joyce's first loan with Honey Care and she plans to use the proceeds from her beehives to pay school fees for her children.

She hails from Maynaguri. She is 27, married and blessed with one young son. She studied up to grade eight; then her parents could not afford the expenses of her education, and so she got married. She lives with her husband, Anupam, and their only son in Khagrabari in the district of Jalpaiguri.\r\n\r\nChampa's husband is engaged in a business of selling turmeric powder. It is a dry yellow powder made by dry grinding of mature turmeric stems. It is used in cooking for color and flavor. He purchases turmeric powder in bulk quantities from wholesale sellers. Then, with the help of Champa, he makes small sachets of the turmeric powder, which he supplies to the local shops. In the rural, improvised area where they live, all these efforts earn an income that is sufficient for a small family like theirs.

Kakamega is located in Western Kenya and is famous for the Kakamega Forest, the only tropical rain forest in Kenya. It is a very good location for beekeeping due to the old growth trees in the forest and concentration of farms in the area, which provide bees with a variety of forage.\r\n\r\nRenson is married and has five children.

Meet Philip, a strong, hardworking and passionate farmer who is 36 years of age and hails from the Bomet area of Kenya, an area that has got wonderful weather patterns that favor animal and crop farming. Philip is a family man, and he has a very beautiful wife and five children that he really adores and cherishes. Being very hardworking, he has been practicing farming for the past two years, and through farming he has been able to provide the basic needs for his lovely family.\r\n\r\nPhilip is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to buy a dairy cow and be able to fully satisfy the demand for milk in his area. Because of an increase in population, the demand for milk has gone up, but the supply is so low and that is why Philip wants to take advantage of the situation and try to reap more from selling milk. \r\n\r\nThe Bomet area has got one of the best weather patterns, and therefore animal food is not a problem because there is plenty of grass and milk production is so high. Through the loan he is sure that his young family will have the basic needs and provide a good educational foundation for his children.\r\n\r\nPhilip is a dreamer, and he projects that his business will be able to satisfy the client base and the markets around, hence accumulating more profits. Having gone through the repayment schedule, he is sure of repaying the loan and even asking for more loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1650265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-22T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-21T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.53,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1256.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1481.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1536.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1562.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1648.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1692.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1762.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1838.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1883.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1935.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.71,"local_amount":1416.43,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1553.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054371},{"amount":17.61,"local_amount":1408.61,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1544.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547560},{"amount":16.98,"local_amount":1358.19,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1489.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680543},{"amount":21.74,"local_amount":1738.84,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1906.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624825},{"amount":20.72,"local_amount":1657.44,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1817.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193898},{"amount":20.14,"local_amount":1611.42,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1767.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823372},{"amount":20.19,"local_amount":1614.86,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1770.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261840},{"amount":22.7,"local_amount":1816.23,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1991.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636263975},{"amount":22.19,"local_amount":1775.59,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1947.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600099},{"amount":38.03,"local_amount":3202.88,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3512.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.01,"payment_id":681376967},{"amount":27.46,"local_amount":2399.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2631.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.52,"payment_id":711507231}],"funded_date":"2014-07-22T15:25:20Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:56:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":740239,"name":"Joanes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joanes is a married man.

Every day, Lorenzo walks through the surrounding cantons searching for livestock such as cows, bulls, oxen, and even pigs that the locals are interested in selling to him.

In addition to this, he cultivates basic grains such as corn and beans.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for from CREDICAMPO is for buying more livestock, since he doesn't have enough capital to continue working and be able to make good investments since there are times when he comes up short for buying livestock.\r\n\r\nSince he started working in this trade, Lorenzo has always had a dream to be able to buy a vehicle to transport the livestock that he buys.   It would be much easier for him to get around since now he has to call someone to make the trip for him.  This is his dream and he knows that with the help of this loan, little by little he will be able to reach his goal.
