She is a woman with a lot of aspirations and has a desire to improve herself with an entrepreneurial vision. She is into manufacturing photo frames. Initially, her husband gave orders to photo frame manufactures and supplied the frames to different shops in his locality, but he was not able to achieve the target when there was high demand. This is when Lata came up with the idea of starting to manufacture photo frames. This way, she would be able to help her husband with the expenses as well as be financially independent. They earn around INR 500 per day. Now Lata has three to five women working for her. \r\n\r\nShe has started taking orders from other suppliers so she needs to buy more materials to manufacture photo frames. For this reason, she is seeking a loan of INR 10,000.  The couple is trying to expand their business on a large scale so that they can generate employment for others and improve their own living standards. This will give Lata an opportunity to earn more and save for her children\u2019s education and for her family's needs. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1650430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Vulnerable Groups","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy more materials to manufacture photo frames ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Deoghar, Jharkhand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-07-22T10:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-21T10:00:01Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-22T15:14:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":739844,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds, fertilizer, pest control, etc., as well as improve the land.

Through profits that she gathers from farming she is able to take care of her family needs and take her five children to school. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is an area that has a ready market for poultry products.

I slowly started learning from him. He inspired me to cook and think outside the box. We started competing on who can make the best meals with a side of fresh organic hummus.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe love they have for cooking grew and still is growing. \u201cMy passion for cooking is something I have been wanting to share with the world. I saw a great store that was a check-cashing place and decided to purchase it. I'm converting the check-cashing store into a beautiful restaurant called Hummus.

jobs and then were unable to find new work. She knew that her family had experience in custodial services, so she started the business to provide an additional income stream for her family.\n\nMaria will use her second Kiva loan to buy new equipment, such as a trailer to transport her commercial carpet cleaner purchased with her first loan. She will also use the money to pay worker\u2019s comp insurance, as well as for marketing materials like flyers and pamphlets.\n\nAs a fully family run business, Maria loves how her venture has served to rally her family around a unified purpose during the recent economic downturn.

He has over 20 trees in his compound and various works of art.

Therefore, Murzali is maximally busy with this work. Every day, he leads the livestock to pasture. He cleans the cowshed and maintains control over the cleanliness and health of the cattle. Murzali prepared a place specially for the cattle, where they spend the days. He skillfully formed the former channel where water flowed into a small pasture. His wife helps him with the dairy cows. They sell the milk produced and receive additional income. His children are grown already and work independently. They help their father and mother financially. But Murzali is not accustomed to sitting idly by. He has his own livestock from which he receives his well-earned income. Using the season, Murzali wants to buy a cow and feed.

She has a lot of experience in the area of animal husbandry and knows all the fine points of this work. From the livestock, she receives her income which she uses for housing, the children's education, and well-being. Monand has three cows and three sheep. She also milks a cow and receives fresh and delicious milk. Selling milk, she receives additional income. <br \/><br \/>Since the livestock for Monand provide only seasonal income, she also does collective farming. All year round, she can find in the garden fresh greens. This is how she covers the daily expenses of the family. She has four children, three of which are grown and only one is a dependent of Monand. Her son helps her with the livestock and often leads them to pasture. Monand plans to buy cattle and their feed, but does not have enough money in hand. Monand decided to apply to MDO Arvand for a loan. She very much hopes to find solutions to their problems through acquiring loans. She thanks MDO Arvand in advance for the trust and

the outskirts of Churachandpur in the Northeastern state of India. Hatkhotin is the featured member of Quarter A pictured with raised hand. This group\u2019s main purpose in coming together and forming a group is to raise their economic and living standard by accessing loan for a mini 45 watt solar lighting worth 12,173 INR. Hatkhotin being the representative of the group shared about the grievance of not having access to regular power supply in the town. She cannot run her business till late hours due to irregular electric supply and frequent load shedding. This forced her to divert a considerable share of means to the purchase of another alternative lighting device. As the family lives only on the pension of her grandfather it is difficult for them to spend an extra amount on another alternative device.\r\n\r\nHatkhotin used to teach in a local private school but the amount she gets as a salary could not meet the expenses of the family. Therefore, in order to supplement her income Hatkhotin resigned from the teaching job and opened a variety store near her house. She says that she earns a profit of around 400-500 INR per day. She says she gets lot of free time to do side business while running the store, too.\r\n\r\nHatkhotin wants to access a solar loan to buy a 45-watt solar home lighting system which will light up 4 light bulbs for 12 hrs a day. Since it has 90 meters of  wire, it can be install in any four adjacent rooms in the house or as per user\u2019s own convenience. Mobile phone charging can be more hassle free unlike depending only on the conventional electricity to charge the phone. With the help of the solar loan, Hatkhotin expects to get more income by opening her store till late in the evening. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the other group members are also busy in their businesses and are working hard. Their businesses include weaving, tailoring and a variety store. They will all use the solar light in their activity at night. They are hopeful for better and bigger outcome in the days to come, if Kiva continues the good work towards them in the future, too.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1626127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To own solar lighting to install in her variety store so as to open for longer hours at night.

The town is about 40 kms from the city, capital of Manipur, which is one of the northeastern states of India. Kimsy belongs to \"Rose\" group and she is the featured borrower for the group. She is pictured with her hand raised. Kimsy is married and blessed with one child.\r\n\r\n Her husband is a farmer and during off seasons, he helps Kimsy run errands for the drug store. Kimsy has been running a drug shop for more than a couple of years in the village where she resides. She usually gets the drugs from the main city wholesalers and sells them in the village with a little profit. Her purpose for running the drug store is to facilitate the villagers with first aid supplies and also to earn an income. Having not access to hospitals and clinics in the village, villagers are ensured of buying the essential drugs that she stocks in the shop. The Primary Health Center in the village is defunct due to irregular attendance of the staff. The villagers and neighboring villagers ask for first aid supplies in Kimsy\u2019s drug store before they visit hospitals in the main capital city, Imphal.\r\n\r\n Since her drug store serves customers till late hours she wants to install solar to provide better lighting and to extend her working hours. The power supply is very irregular and frequent load shedding prevails in the village. She has to use other alternative lighting devices to light up her shop which means she has to spend an extra amount from the income she gets. Therefore, Kimsy believes that owning a solar lighting system will help her in reducing the expenditures and at the same time make her work more comfortable and easier at night.     \r\n\r\nThe presence of Kimsy\u2019s drug store has been a relieving factor for the villagers. They can now purchase any first aid kits, antibiotic, cough syrup, etc. which are available at her shop, and that saves the villagers the fares spent going to the town market.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBuddo School will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She gets up very early to dress the chickens that she will sell during the day.  She started selling chicken to support her husband.  Thanks to the loans that have been given to her, she has managed to grow little by little in her business.  Minerva mentioned that she will now buy more chickens and chicken wire to expand the coop where she puts them so that they do not get away.  Having her husband's support is a big motivation.  With the profits, she has remodeled the house and paid for those expenses.  With the profits that she gets she will save to buy a chicken skinner.  This way it will be easier for her to have the chicken ready, and she will be able to sleep a little more.  \n\nBeing part of the communal bank makes everyone a family, and they have always tried to join our efforts.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6500,"image":{"id":1642549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicken and chicken wire for the chicken coop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tembladeras del castillo, Acatlan de Perez Figuero","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-07-22T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-21T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":6500,"lender_count":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.12,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evarista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva Jessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":84000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":6500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8400},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1950,"local_amount":25200,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25297.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705255},{"amount":1300,"local_amount":16800,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16864.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530255696},{"amount":1300,"local_amount":16800,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":16864.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690511},{"amount":1300,"local_amount":16800,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":16864.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561823492},{"amount":628.88,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":8432.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.12,"payment_id":579807701}],"funded_date":"2014-07-23T20:29:43Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T16:04:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":740491,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a vegetable vending business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to buy more vegetables to sell for her vegetable vending business.\r\n\r\nJosefina has been in this business for four years.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Yahaya Jalo is ambitious and is aiming to reap 40 bags\/hectare this season. When asked, Yahaya Jalo said \u201cI plan to use the money I make to educate my children Isah and Jalo,\u201d and in five years to \u201cmake more money for myself and my family.\" With this loan, he is well on his way to achieving this dream.

He says that when he was very small\u2014nine years old\u2014he began working carrying packages to help his father, who had a business and only let Stefano participate in his free time. When Stefano grew up, he asked his father to let him work; however, his father just wanted him to finish his education so that he could later start his own business, so that is exactly what Stefano did. \r\n\r\nToday, he is a well-known merchant in his neighborhood and the surrounding areas. He sells sweaters, shirts, bermuda shorts, etc., as well as many articles that his customers ask him for. He sells to them in cash or on credit, working every day from 8:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening and buying from warehouses in other countries like Panama and the United States. His main goal is to have a diverse selection and to launch other sales locations in other municipalities in the department. \r\n\r\nStefano is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy sweaters, shorts, perfume, and general apparel. This investment will stock his business very well and that is precisely what Stefano wants in order to affect his sales.

Flor Maria is 30 years old. She has five children (four boys, one girl). She makes a living buying and selling mollusc, besides deheading shrimp, to make a little extra money.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she has had a difficult life.  During her first engagement, when she had her first four children, she lived through a series of physical mistreatments that led to separation.  During her second engagement, she could not either to come to an understanding with her partner. He drank a lot of alcohol, and this would not allow the existence of harmony at home. She was abandoned during her sixth month of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nShe currently lives with her five children in a little house that she has been able to acquire, and little by little set up for her children to have their own space to grow up.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy more mollusc and increase her sales, aspiring to sell wholesale. In this way, she will be able to buy from her neighbors at better prices, paying a fair price. Her ambitions are to have sufficient resources to also be able to buy the shrimp wholesale, and commercialize these two products (mollusc and shrimp). Thus she will be able to employ more people for the shrimp deheading.  And mainly, to support her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":1649919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

It has beautiful country landscapes and friendly people. Se\u00f1ora Rosa lives here. She is 59 years old, and she is married. She has five grown children from this relationship, one of whom still lives at home. Her husband is a farmer. \r\n\r\nShe started a business several years ago, in order to help her husband with the household expenses, as his income is not enough to cover all of them. She has a small caf\u00e9 in her house. There, on the weekends, she prepares snacks and fast food such as hamburgers, corviches (a dish made with bananas and fish), empanadas, shakes, and fresh juices. She makes the delicious dish, \"aguado de pollo\" (a soup made with chicken, rice, potatoes, onions, peppers, and other vegetables and herbs). Her customers like it so much that they come to her caf\u00e9 every weekend.

is a repeat client of UGAFODE Microfinance Ltd. (MDI). He is a resident of Muntungo zone 4, Nakawa division, and Kampala district. Joseph is married to Annet with one child, aged 2 months. \n\nJoseph has been a carpenter for the last 10 years. He managed to buy a plot of land, and he has been able to build a house on it using loans that he has acquired from UGAFODE. However, he faces a challenge of increased prices for timber and high electricity bills, since he uses machines that use power to make furniture. \n\nHe has applied for a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan shillings to complete his house.

It is a place known by its hardworking people, dedicated to agriculture and stockbreeding. \r\n\r\nIn this place lives Jenny, who is 40 years old, married and has three children, ages 17, 13 and 7. The eldest children attend to school. Her husband is a driver and works driving a bus.\r\n\r\nWith the objective of having her own income, and making the most of her knowledge in dressmaking, she established a small sewing workshop at her own house. There she makes all kinds of clothes. \r\n\r\nAlso at her house, she has a shop where she sells oils and all kinds of car lubricants. She works everyday and her children help her at the shop when she has a lot of garments to sew.

Irma came to the conclusion that the market lacked a place that sold bread, so she took an important step and decided to open her own business.  She also sells pastries, chicken sandwiches, and other products.  Her delivery route for making sales measures one kilometer.  No one else is involved in her business.  Irma\u2019s work schedule is from 8:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M.  It is important to mention that Irma submits a loan request every 20 days, so she always has an application that is being processed.

Zarrina decided to find a source of income in order to cover regular family expenses and help her husband to provide for his wife and children. Zarrina began to learn how to cut and sew national women's dresses. This business could bring her a good income, but she does not have a sewing machine. She is requesting this loan to purchase a sewing machine in order to start her business and create a new source of income for the family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":916.89,"image":{"id":1650337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to
