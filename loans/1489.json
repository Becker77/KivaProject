has been in for eight years. He is married and has four sons and two daughters who are still at school. He works hard so as to improve his family life, taking his small kids to a better private school. He works from 7am to evening each working day, moving from one farmer to another to purchase stock. \r\n\r\nDespite his hard work and sometimes selling at low prices (price discrimination from big buyers), he makes a small profit each month. In order to be able to sell his stock at a good price, Martin requires enough capital to be able to own a truck and a good\/modern storage place. With that, he can defend against tobacco diseases and against 'big fish' who force him to sell at a very low price because there is no option. He found himself expensive and traveling far to transport his stock to the cigarette industry. He dreams that one day he will be able to expand his business so as to maximize his income and afford a better life for his family. \r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, this is his second loan which he will use to buy stocks of local tobacco to resell. He used the previous credit, repaid successfully, to buy extra sacks of business stock than before. He managed to resell and received profits which, as a father, he used to cover school fees and home food expenses. He will share this loan with his group, \"MUAFAKA\", which consists of two members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

She is considered as one of the most hardworking farmers in her village, and she has gained so much respect.

Meet Yonah, 37 years of age and a very hardworking, honest and humble man who hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area than never lacks rainfall and is blessed by good climatic conditions. Being raised from a humble background, Yonah practices a lot of humility. His parents taught him to be very hardworking so that he can make it in life. Through hard work he has practiced farming for the past 4 years and has been able to care for the needs of his family. \r\n\r\nYonah also practices tree farming. He has many trees on his farm that are ready for harvesting, but he faces the challenge of cutting them down. He has been using crude methods to cut down the trees, such as using machetes or \u201cpanga\u201d and ropes which is very time consuming. That is why he is asking for a loan of KES 50,000 to buy a power saw to help him cut down trees fast with less energy and time. Through the loan Yonah will be able to sell more timber to his neighbors and the markets around, because Kitale is still developing and more people are building houses. This means that timber has a ready market. \r\n\r\nBeing a very hardworking man and someone who really values education, he wants to give his children the best education he can, because this is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. Profits from selling timber will be used to pay back the loan and to hire other employees to work for him in supplying and cutting down trees, hence impacting the society positively.\r\n\r\nYonah plans to open a very big timber yard where people will be coming to buy timber and posts of all sizes, hence generating more

Meet Miriam, a 30-year-old mother who is very kind, loving and charming. Miriam hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and one of the best places to do farming in the world. The climatic conditions in this area favor farming and Miriam, being a hard working mother, has taken full advantage of that. Miriam is blessed with four children and she refers to them as \u201cher pride\u201d and she takes good care of them since they are the source of her happiness. \r\n\r\nMiriam has been doing farming for the past six years and since she ventured into farming she has always made tremendous strides in terms of profit margins. Through practicing mixed farming (that is, crop and animal farming) she has been able to support her family and provide for them the basic necessities in life. Although Miriam has been making profits through farming the income is not enough to fully support her family. Consequently, she has been having a dream of starting a poultry business. The main challenge that Miriam is facing is getting her business off the ground. Therefore she is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES to be able to start a poultry farming busines. Through the loan Miriam will be able to comfortably take care of her family and assure her children and  grandchildren of a secure future. \r\n\r\nMiriam is very hard working and she is sure that she can turn around the loan into one of the best business enterprises and be able to employ more people to assist in the farm work. Being a mother in Africa Is very challenging and accessing financial solutions is hard but through your loan Miriam is sure that you will be able to \u201ctransform the lives of small scale holders by providing financial solutions\u201d. Miriam plans to buy more poultry once the business has picked up and be able to repay the loan through the profits she will be getting. Increased profits will make her business flourish and hence provide a secure solid education system to her

All the financial institutions rejected her loan request because of her unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.

Meet James, one of the most hardworking men on earth. He is ambitious and 29 years of age. James hails from Kitale area of Kenya, an area that is called the \u201cbread basket\u201d of Kenya since half of the food that Kenya consumes is from that area. \r\n\r\nJames has been doing farming for the past 10 years and he has gathered immense wealth of experience through all those years. Because of the experience that he has, he offers free advice to young farmers who want to start farming and also extension services to his neighbors. \r\n\r\nJames practices mixed farming and through these ventures he has been able to reap more profits but has not reached the maximum. \r\n\r\nJames sells vegetables and milk to the nearby market that is far from where he lives, and he has been experiencing a challenge in transporting the products to the market. James' village is very remote and there is poor infrastructure and roads are very poor and this has been a challenge to James because products from his farm reach the market very late when they are not fresh, hence fetching a low price.\r\n\r\nJames deals with perishable goods and therefore he needs to deliver them to the market as quickly as possible. That is why he is seeking a loan of KES 60,000 to purchase a motorbike that will assist him in delivering the products quickly to the market. \r\n\r\nJames is sure that through timely delivery of products he will reap maximum profits and he will be able to support his two children and his family. \r\n\r\nJames dream is to continue cultivating his land and selling more produce to the market so that his family does not lack anything. Through profits gathered he will pay back the loan on time and secure the future of his

He does jobs for individuals around the city of Medellin. He is looking for better opportunities and more income for his family and is trying to be closer to his children. He decided to set up a business selling ice cream in his own home 9 years ago; this means that his wife can help him with the business and increase his earnings.

She beautifully runs her small business. Mukadas sells children's clothing. Previously, she brought goods from Bishkek, but because this is not the season and her business is not advancing well, she decided not to wait until September or the fall season. Currently, she does not have a lot of merchandise left. Judging from Mukadas's words, it can be understood that she is a strong-willed woman and does not intend to abandon her business due to temporary difficulties. After all, the business that she started several years ago, guides her in life and provides the primary source of income for her family. Mukadas has three children. All of them are school students and supported by Mukadas. Because she never obtained a higher education, she intends to educate her children and provide them with an opportunity to become qualified specialists.\r\n\r\nMukadas is a loyal client of MDO Arvand and has been obtaining financing for two years and has a good history of repaying loans. She had originally planned her next loan closer to the next season, but Mukadas urgently needed a small sum of money. She got a delivery of affordable children's shirts that she could sell and earn a set income. This is why Mukadas does not want to miss this chance and wants to obtain a small loan. With this goal in mind and not thinking twice, she came to MDO Arvand for a loan. She hopes very much for the support and is grateful for the help in advance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":25,"image":{"id":1640402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Chuanoj, a rural area in Totonicapan, Guatemala. It is composed of ten women who are applying for a new loan cycle through KIVA. The ladies are involved in various businesses such as animal husbandry, retail sales (snacks, traditional clothing) and textile production (weaving). They are most grateful to be able to access capital in the form of the small loans so that they can maintain and expand their small businesses and generate enough income to support their families.\n\nThe Secretary of the trust bank is 28 year old Cecilia. She is married and has four children who range in age from three to eleven. Cecilia fabricates traditional skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d on a foot loom. In order to meet the demand of her customers, she has hired three additional people from Chuanoj. She provides enough fabric and thread to her employees so that they can work efficiently.  Cecilia needs another loan in order to purchase a large quantity of thread and other supplies. She wants her business to move forward!\n\nCecilia is excited to be part of Mujeres de Chuanoj Trust Bank because, besides having access to loans, the ladies gain valuable business and personal tools each month when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares relevant information with them. The ladies learn about how to manage their loans with discussions about effective business management practices. They learn about how to most effectively take care of their families with new information about nutrition, hygiene, and health. They understand how best to get their children ready for school. And, they learn how to use the medicinal plants that might be growing right in their own neighborhoods! Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\n\nThe women of the Trust Bank \u201cMujeres de Chuanoj\u201d are grateful to KIVA investors for their generosity and kindness in funding their small loans. The ladies are able to provide a higher standard of living for their families as well as additional opportunities including education. KIVA investors are valuable partners in this effort!

As a Babban Gona member, Hannatu is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets, and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Hannatu can earn up to $2,000\/hectare this season from growing maize, more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

Purnima and her husband are illiterate and can only sign their names.

He sells his produce in the local market.  He has been engaged in this business for many years.  For the last two years, his business has not been going well.  The soil in their area is so productive and fertile that most of the common and poor people are engaged in agribusinesses. As a result, he had to face many competitors. \r\nSo, being the sole breadwinner, it was difficult for him to cover all the necessities of a seven-member family.  Purnima then started livestock breeding with the purchase of one dairy cow.  She is active and diligent.  She sells milk to her neighbors.  She gives great financial support to their family.\r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business for better income, she wants to purchase one more dairy cow.

They live in the Hamadoni region of Tajikistan.  Zaynabby's husband is a dekhan farmer; he has a plot of land all his own for growing crops, and spends most of his time working the fields.  Zaynabby's son is a migrant worker abroad.  Nasiba, his wife, lives in Tajikistan and looks after her husband's aging parents.  Zaynabby is 59 and works as a seamstress making Tajikistani women's clothing for a living.  She wants to impart all of her skill and ability to Nasiba.  Nasiba has only just started to learn from Zaynabby, and wants to learn how to make not only Tajikistani clothing, but clothing in general as well.

However, she has managed to pull through and has always put food on the table for this large family.\r\n\r\nSarah practices mixed farming to make ends meet and, through animal and crop farming, she has been able to get more profits. Sarah sells the fruits of her labor to the nearby market and has been able to build a large customer base. Sarah has been practicing farming for the past 20 years and has gained a wealth of experience. She has been able to face good times and bad times in farming. Although Sarah makes profits, she still faces the challenges of feeding her large family, and so she wants to start a poultry business. Sarah is seeking a loan of KES 45,000 to buy poultry and to be able to increase her income levels. Through increased income levels, Sarah will be sure that her 9 children will get a good education and be able to have a brighter future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":452.14,"image":{"id":1651534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

The Kitale area is an area with high poultry production and consumption and this has made Bilha come up with a business idea of starting a poultry business. Bilha is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to buy poultry and be able to meet the demand and market that is already there.\r\n\r\nThrough profits gathered from selling eggs and poultry meat she will be able to fully finance the loan and also support her kids through their entire education system and help them have a much improved lifestyle.\r\n\r\nBilha dreams of opening a large egg-selling shop that will be selling eggs to wholesalers and to retailers. With this kind of shop she is sure that she will get out of the poverty bracket.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1651528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-23T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-22T20:10:06Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2512.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2962.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3072.39},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3125.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3233.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3296.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3385.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3524.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3571.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3677.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3766.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3871.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.72,"local_amount":6292.1,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6556.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054380},{"amount":35.32,"local_amount":2974.72,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3099.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547567},{"amount":37.35,"local_amount":3145.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3277.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680553},{"amount":40.1,"local_amount":3376.65,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3518.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624833},{"amount":79.53,"local_amount":6696.85,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6978.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823377},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":7104.47,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7402.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636263984},{"amount":43.86,"local_amount":3719.56,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3875.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":665458739},{"amount":75.46,"local_amount":6690.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6971.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.98,"payment_id":681376973}],"funded_date":"2014-07-25T01:31:42Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":740511,"name":"Monica Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"M\u00f3nica tiene 34 a\u00f1os estado civil uni\u00f3n libre  vive con la pareja y con el hijo en el Cant\u00f3n ventanas provincia de los r\u00edos.\n\nVRC CEVALLOS, SE ENCUENTRA UBICADA EN EL RECINTO SAN FRANCISCO, PERTENECE A LA PARROQUIA SAN JUAN DE PUEBLO VIEJO SE DEDICAN A LABORES AGRICOLAS. \n\nM\u00f3nica se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz y soya, adem\u00e1s se dedica a la crianza de animales como gallinas y cerdos.

\u201cChiengkonpang K\u201d. They all live in the outskirts of a village in the state of Manipur, which is in the northeastern part of India. They formed the group in 2014, with an aim to generate income for themselves by accessing a loan. \r\n\r\nKhuolneiting is one of the eight members of the group and is pictured with a raised hand. She is 51 years old and is a mother to two children. Her two kids are in college. Khuolneiting\u2019s husband is a carpenter by profession. He builds houses and furniture around the area. Her husband\u2019s activity could not be of much significance for supplementing the family income. Therefore, she decided to open a general store to help generate more income for the family. Khuolneiting sells general items such as pan, cigarettes, cereals, lentils, sugar, cold drinks, etc. \r\n\r\nWith her profits, she wants to expand her store by increasing her inventory. She is happy that she could now help her children in paying their college fees and educational expenses without depending on her husband. Now she manages the daily needs of the family with her income and saves her husband\u2019s daily earnings down to a rupee. She also employs two people to help her in running the store. Khuolneiting, along with her husband, means to provide a good environment and create a sound family atmosphere for the children's education. \r\n\r\nNow, she needs a solar loan for her store business. She wishes to install the 45-watt solar home lighting in her general store so that she could extend her business hours for a longer period after sunset. The light irregularity in her locality is a great hurdle for the income-generating people. More customers flock in after dusk to buy their daily essential needs, which means her business is more profitable past sunset.   \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members also need a solar loan for their respective income-generating activities. Weaving, a variety store and a pan shop are some of the activities of the group members.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1651405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a 45-watt solar home lighting system to light up her shop past sunset to run the business for longer hours.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-07-23T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-22T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khuolneiting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimlalnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaienching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niangzahoih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalneihchoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalruatkimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zuali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suanching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":97384,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":97384}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-24T18:11:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":741118,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene is 27 years old and has four children.

The member of the Communal Bank engage in different activities such as selling soft drinks and sodas, making Andean flutes and Pan pipes, selling meals, weaving blankets and jumpers, making handicrafts with recycled materials, selling shoes.\r\n\r\nDionicia is one of the micro entrepreneurs of this group, and she will benefit from the requested loan. She says that she has become a member of Pro Mujer for the first time, having joined the institution following their intense promotion campaign. She is currently selling meals, and she says she learned her job from her father who used to run the same activity. After she got married, she decided starting working independently in this field, as she could count on some experience.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is now requesting will be used to increase her supplies for the dry season by buying food at wholesale price from wholesalers in the town of El Alto; she will then prepare her meals and sell them during the various fairs that take place in her neighborhood. This type of activity helps her earning an income to economically support her family, as she is married and has a son.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about what she likes of Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the life insurance provided by the institution.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1636391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Compra

This year, the summer is much hotter than usual, and Shirinmo and her daughter no longer have a choice, besides requesting a loan and purchasing the air conditioner.

With this investment, he plans to increase his productivity and achieve greater customer interest, making his credikiva a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1649540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy raw materials  in bulk like beef, pork, chicken and sauces.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-07-23T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-22T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":88.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elkin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1230000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":86668},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89268},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91946},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94704},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97546},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100472},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":103486},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":106591},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109788},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":113082},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":116475},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":119974}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.55,"local_amount":175936,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":180299.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026069},{"amount":50.46,"local_amount":91946,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":94226.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518254},{"amount":49.42,"local_amount":94704,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":97052.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.55,"payment_id":562430883},{"amount":92.01,"local_amount":198018,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":202928.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.66,"payment_id":595164129},{"amount":88.76,"local_amount":210077,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":215286.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.52,"payment_id":624849255},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":109788,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":112510.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.87,"payment_id":636603339},{"amount":75.56,"local_amount":160219,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":164192.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.37,"payment_id":649571578},{"amount":84,"local_amount":189312,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":194006.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.89,"payment_id":666496954}],"funded_date":"2014-08-22T23:09:06Z","paid_date":"2015-06-21T12:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ignacio Perez de la Cruz","image":148187}},{"id":741188,"name":"Jos\u00e9phine's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jos\u00e9phine est commer\u00e7ante et membre d\u2019un collectif  d\u2019affaires \u00abLa Joie \u00bb, entrepreneur, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 34 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants dont 5 \u00e9tudient et 1 est encore gosse.

Gwamaka depends on this business to generate income for her family, so she puts all of her energy into satisfying her customers, such as by playing nice music at the store. She explains that she usually works from 2 pm until after midnight on a daily basis, which allows her to realize good profits each month. <p>\r\n\r\nFor the sake of improving her business, Gwamaka, together with other eight members, approached Tujijenge to obtain financial support. The group members will hold each other accountable to repay their portions of the loan. This is her second loan request, which she would like to use to buy business chairs and tables, and to replace defective ones. She used the previous loan, which she successfully repaid, to buy a freezer for the business and empty crates of beers. She dreams of growing her enterprise.

His passion led him to spend over 10 years working in a Haitian sewing factory as a production manager. It was during this time he realized that every household has something to be sewn but never finds the time to do it. Moreover, people are in a constant need for clothing adjustments every day because of weight loss or gain.  This personal observation motivated Bazelais to open his own business, to put his personal sewing machine to good use, and start making some extra money.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Bature is ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 50 bags per hectare this season because this loan will give him access to high quality inputs that will positively affect his yield. When asked about his plans for the future, Bature said: \u201cIn 5 years, I want to become the most profitable farmer in my community.\"  With this loan, Bature is well on his way to achieving this dream.
