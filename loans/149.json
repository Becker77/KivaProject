She was born in Corozal, and she is married and the mother of 5 children, ranging in age from 13 to 19. She lives in Juan Mina, one of the two divisions of the rural area surrounding the Colombian city of Barranquilla, 5 km southwest of the urban center along the Algod\u00f3n highway. It is here that she has operated her business for the past 14 years. Her principal activity is selling locally raised chickens. She also has a restaurant located on the main road. Her work is typical in this area, since there are a number of poulty farms. In her restaurant, her specialty is the delicious and well-known \"sancocho de gallina\" [chicken stew]. She has two freezers to conserve her products, and she has the necessary furniture and equipment for her restaurant. She cooks with wood, which according to her gives better flavor to the food. Her chicken business increases during the Christmas season, and for this reason Isabel needs additional capital to increase her purchases of the product and fulfill the great demand during this season. For this reason, she came to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to request a Kiva loan, her first financing with this organization. She will invest it in locally bred chickens, buying them in greater quantity than usual, so she can take advantage of the large number of orders her customers have placed with her.

His very poor parents can\u2019t take care of a large family. He was obliged to stop his studies early at primary school level. Thanks to an uncle who took him as an apprentice tailor, he became a skilful worker and quickly gained experience, and obtained his diploma of tailor embroiderer after four (04) years of apprenticeship. His socio-economical situation did not allow him to quickly be on his own. It took him a long time to get married; today he has three (03) children and has five (05) apprentices in his charge. His life is getting better since he received his first credit of $ 300 which he smoothly paid back. His second credit of $ 550 brought him success and his workshop receives prospects everyday. With his dynamism, perseverance, rigor in the management of his workshop and his well done work, Mr M. is more and more needed, but he doesn\u2019t succeed in satisfying his customers in due time because of the lack of sewing machines. These festive period in which there are increasing demands, constitute a nightmare for him.\r\n\r\nThis credit of $ 850 will help him buy a more performing embroidery machine so that he can be quicker in his activities and mainly improve the quality of his services. The realization of this project will considerably improve his income and his economical and financial potential which will make a change in his social and family environment.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur M.

Il doit son salut \u00e0 un oncle qui le recueille comme apprenti tailleur. Tr\u00e8s assidu dans ce m\u00e9tier, il gagna rapidement en exp\u00e9rience et obtint son dipl\u00f4me de tailleur brodeur apr\u00e8s quatre (04) ans d\u2019apprentissage. Sa situation socio \u00e9conomique ne lui permettant pas de se prendre rapidement en charge, il mis du temps pour se marier et a aujourd\u2019hui trois (03 enfants et a \u00e0 sa charge cinq (05) apprentis. Sa situation tend \u00e0 s\u2019am\u00e9liorer depuis que Monsieur M. a re\u00e7u son premier cr\u00e9dit de $300 qu\u2019il avait d\u2019ailleurs bien rembours\u00e9. Son second cr\u00e9dit de $550 l\u2019a totalement relanc\u00e9 et son atelier tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quent\u00e9. Avec son dynamisme, sa pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, sa rigueur dans la gestion de son atelier et son travail bien fait, Monsieur M. est de plus en plus sollicit\u00e9, mais il n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 satisfaire sa client\u00e8le \u00e0 temps \u00e0 cause de l\u2019insuffisance des machines.

Desde ni\u00f1o apoyaba en las labores agr\u00edcolas a sus padres, pero cuando form\u00f3 su propia familia empez\u00f3 a sembrar de manera independiente papas, arvejas y ma\u00edz. Para atender sus cultivos con mucha paciencia se levanta a las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana, que es cuando aprovecha en regar o fumigar, para que a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana s\u00f3lo se dedique a remover y quitar las yerbas de sus cultivos. Cuando sus cosechas est\u00e1n listas las env\u00eda directamente al mercado m\u00e1s importante y grande de la ciudad de Tarma, donde generalmente logra vender sus productos a un buen precio. Por ello, Manuel se siente muy contento con su actividad, ya que trabaja en armon\u00eda con su esposa y todos sus hijos; por eso, para las cosechas no necesita buscar operarios, prefiere pagarles a sus hijos, de ese modo los motiva a que tambi\u00e9n siembren, pues reconoce que gracias a la agricultura los educ\u00f3 y les brindo una econom\u00eda s\u00f3lida.

El dinero que viene solicitando es para la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos y 24 kilos de  ma\u00edz para su pr\u00f3xima siembra. ","en":"Manuel is 54 years old and lives with his wife in their own home.  They have 6 children and also a 7 year old grandson.  Manuel is known to be a man of good character and an industrious worker.  He has been farming since he was a boy by helping his parents on their property, but when he started a family, he began planting his own crops of potatoes, peas and corn.  Tending to his crops requires much patience.  He wakes up at 4am to begin watering or fumigating.  By 8am, he has moved on to removing weeds.  When his crops have been harvested, he sends them directly to the largest market in the city of Tarma where producers go to get the best price.  Manuel is very pleased with his work and with that of his wife and children.  He does not have to hire workers to harvest crops because he would rather pay his children to do it.  He hopes this will motivate them to start their own farms.  Manuel acknowledges that agriculture has helped educate his children and provided for his family financially.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.   He was able to join because he was invited by a neighbor, so he is very grateful.  He is committed to following the group rules and making his payments on time.  The money he is requesting will be used to buy chemical fertilizers and 24 kilos of corn for the next planting.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":369057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-15T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":514.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734230}],"funded_date":"2009-08-15T18:28:30Z","paid_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":132889,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma C. is 37 years old CEVI client from Talibon Bohol.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase bulk crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023052},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868293},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757489},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146583},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984728},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015401}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T00:36:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":141112,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene S. is from the village of Bato.

While both members of the group receive an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if they are delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is V\u1ecdng Nguy\u1ec7t 3 - Nh\u00f3m 03 (3).\r\n<br>T. is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, T. owns and operates a tailoring business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members. T. has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,256,000 VND from SEDA. This loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,152,000 VND, which will also be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. The loan will be her third from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About the other borrower in the group<\/b><br>\r\n1.

SPBD's loans are Siupolu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siupolu C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD

Saloevich A. has been selling clothes on the market for 17 years. He is married and has 3 children. His wife is not employed and the clothes business is the primary source of income for the Asrarov family. At first he was purchasing clothes in credit from the wholesalers and selling them at the market. However, due to the competition on the market Mr. A. was forced to find an alternative lending source... In the beginning of 2005 he found out about the credit program \"Microintrest\". Mr. A. received a loan and with that money was able to purchase goods from wholesalers without credit, which resulted in lower prices. After receiving more loans he was able to import the goods himself, bypassing the wholesaler altogether. Currently Misharif A. regularly travels to Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) himself to import the clothes he will sell at the market. He also sells clothes in credit to the small merchants from kishlaks (mountain villages) which is profitable for both parties. A part of the income he uses to support his family, but majority he has dedicated to expanding his business.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

They named their group the Mathew Group. They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Makeni. This is the sixth time they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one in the group received a loan of 1,000,000 LE. That loan created meaningful impact in the lives of these people. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Today, they are requesting a loan of 3,000,000 LE to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nIsatu S. (left) is the leader of the group. She is thirty-five years of age. She was born in Makeni, north of Sierra Leone. She is married with three children. Two of her children are in secondary school and one is in primary school. Her husband is a businessman who sells second-hand clothes. Isatu sells both soft and hard drinks in Makeni City.\r\n<P>\r\nWith this new loan, Isatu will expand on her business. She will be able to buy at least twelve crates of soft drinks, seven crates of beer, three crates of Battery energy drink and three crates of power shakes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Don Mart\u00edn se dedica a la agricultura y toda su familia le ayuda un poco a la hora de la siembra y la recolecta de los cultivos. \nLa comunidad en la cual vive Mart\u00edn se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la agricultura y a las lecher\u00edas. El Sauce tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\nCon Mart\u00edn tiene un peque\u00f1o terreno de 1.2 hect\u00e1reas en el cual siembra diferentes cultivos como ma\u00edz, frijoles, pl\u00e1tano y caf\u00e9. \u00c9l tiene 27 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la agricultura.

Con esto espera lograr una buena cosecha que pueda vender y ayudar a salir adelante a su familia. La cosecha la espera vender en la misma finca. \nDon Mart\u00edn es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya 6 microcr\u00e9ditos y todos los ha cancelado satisfactoriamente.

Actualmente don Mart\u00edn necesita un pr\u00e9stamo por quinientos mil colones para comprar las semillas y el fertilizante.\n","en":"Mart\u00edn V. A. is 42.  He lives with his wife and 3 children:  Gustavo, Jason, and Estiven.  Don Mart\u00edn makes a living through agriculture, and his whole family helps him a little during planting and harvesting seasons.  The area where Mart\u00edn lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba.  It's a small rural community with 2,000 people.  They are dedicated to agriculture and dairy operations.  El Sauce has an irregular landscape, and much of the land is mantained as tropical forests.  The community has very picturesque landscapes which combine the tropical forest with lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is approximately an hour and a half from Turrialba by bus, the closest city.  Several times a year, the road becomes impassable because of the rains that fall in the area.  This is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges for the community.  When there isn't any work, the people choose to look for jobs in Turrialba or on banana farms located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nCurrently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the neighbors are looking to invest in projects in their area.  Mart\u00edn has 1.2 hectares, on which he plants different crops like corn, beans, plantains, and coffee.  He has been dedicated to agriculture for 27 years.  During this time, he has had seasons that have gone very well and others when he has had to battle problems such as bad prices or natual phenomenons that damage his crops.  He obtained his land through a small loan.  Previously he had to rent land to sow his crops.\r\n\r\nDon Mart\u00edn is a client of the Association of Producers in El Sauce, a local organization that is a member of the microfinance institution EDESA.  Thanks to his connections with this organization, he has already obtained six microcredits, and all of them have been paid back satisfactorily.  The amounts of the loans have increased from 100,000 colones (180 USD) to 250,000 (450 USD) colones.  Currently don Mart\u00edn needs a loan of 500,000 (900 USD) colones to purchase seeds and fertilizer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva

Miray, Baliangao. She is 29 years old, married, with 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Anecita owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anecita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan  from PMPC. Anecita is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase a fishing boat. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Anecita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives together with his two sons, with whom he has assumed the role of father and mother owing to his separation from his wife.  His dream to educate his children led him to put together his own locksmith's shop, in which he has worked for more than 10 years.  He began the shop with the support of some friends, who helped him to get his first customers.  He now has two shops and a good number of customers who frequently solicit his services.  This profession enables him to continue improving his economic income, and it is for this reason that one of his goals is to install his locksmith's shops in commercial zones, where the shops' locations would generate increased earnings.  However, in order to achieve this goal, he must keep a watchful eye on his two locations; to help him try to do this, he relies on the assistance of his sons and father to keep the shops running smoothly.  To be able to expand, he must improve the quality of the labor at his shops. To do this, he requires various tools that he has been waiting to modernize, since the ones he has are all worn out and need replacing.  This is his first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, for which he promises to be responsible with his payments and toward the institution.  The 2500 soles that he is requesting will permit him to buy the tools and materials required for him to complete the remaining jobs he has yet to complete for his customers.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":378462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Compra de materiales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T18:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":171.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":177.68},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":181.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":190.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":194.79},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":201.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":214.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":216.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":226.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":232.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":241.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2516,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081256}],"funded_date":"2009-08-28T21:16:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":137017,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"42-year-old Marcelina J. is a married woman who mothers eight children.

Maylen has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. She is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used to make improvements to her house. This loan will be her ninth from PMPC.

She lives in a rented home with her two children.  Fiorella is 20, and Gerson is 13.  What she wants most of all is to give them a good life.\r\n\r\nShe makes her living as a street vendor selling clothes.  Every day she goes to public and private institutions looking for customers who want to buy something that she is selling.  She brings the clothes from the city of Lima.  That is why the clothes she sells are very new and striking.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is advising her customers about what clothes are in style.  She has been doing this for 20 years.  The most difficult part is having to walk all day looking for customers.  Later she hopes to have enough money to have a store where she can sell more calmly.\r\n\r\nThis is Deizi\u2019s third loan with MFP.  She is prepared to work very hard to make her payments on time.  She is much loved in her communal bank.  She always adds a lot of joy to the meetings.  She will use the 1,000 PEN that she is asking for to buy more clothes in the city of Lima so that her customers can choose from a greater variety. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":419113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-03T01:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deizi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":203.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843135},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":407.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734713},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":203.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959778},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":203.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992627}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T02:42:08Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":153523,"name":"Raineria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raineria P. is from the village of Mahinog, Camiguin.

She owns a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Sina has many years of experience in this business.  Sina needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sina joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sina P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Married to Folro B., a tricycle driver, she is blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been managing her own egg stall and doing direct selling of cosmetics for eight years now.\r\n\r\nNoime has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her egg-selling and cosmetics direct-selling businesses.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, Noime would like to apply for a PHP 16,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying more quantities of products to be incorporated into her inventory.\r\n\r\nNoime dreams that her businesses will continue to be successful. She also prays that her family will continue to be closer to each other and with the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":511082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

In the future, she plans to promote and expand her business, and she thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nWhether on the streets of Kathmandu or in the villages outside of the capital, tea shops are places of business and meeting in Nepal.  Called a chiya pasal, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner, MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Operating throughout the Kathmandu Valley, it offers microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  <p>\r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates.

Mongolia. His oldest four children, ages 10 to 17, attend a local secondary school while the youngest, age 2 years old, stays at home with Jamsranjav's wife. Jamsranjav operates a horse-cart business in his town. He carries supply loads and people from the local market to various destinations. For each trip, he earns between 3,000-5,000 tugriks (MNT). His business earnings are currently not sufficient to take care of his family; therefore, his wife is planning to operate a boot-making business.

Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nomeriana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Nancy works as a peasant farmer for a living. Her community of Kagwe village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Nancy is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by her village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Nancy represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Nancy and four other promoters in her community, namely Joshua, Siprina, Eunice and Lodphine, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Nancy wants to be a promoter because she  believes that the chlorine will destroy germs in water, therefore making it safe to use. She hopes that this will make the community healthier, thus allowing community members to attend work and school.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Nancy\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lodphine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siprina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":847341,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders, meet Elizabeth.

They also say they are always happy because Pro-Mujer offers them a huge help with the services they grant to their members. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the help of the service consultant, Sonia Aguayo Zeballos, they have been able to make a very well organized group. The group includes several small businesses, such as stores. Others are street vendors that sell artisan chocolates and crafts. The majority of them sell clothing they bring from the Desaguedero where prices are better. Therefore, they need to invest more capital to make trips to Desaguedero or other places where wholesale goods are sold. In this manner, the merchandise acquired will result in greater profits to be reinvested in expanding their businesses. <p>\r\n\r\nMoreover, they need to increase their incomes to support their families.

For the past 3 years she's had a shop, which she had to open due to the need to generate her own income to help support her household economy.  She is very satisfied with the decision, as she began with little merchandise and has steadily increased.  She also wants to increase her capital by selling food. Her great ambition is to increase the stock of her business. Benigna works to keep herself occupied and assist with household costs, and usually works at her shop in the afternoon. This is the first time she is requesting a loan from MFP, and was invited to be part of a community bank that she currently belongs to because the bank saw great team member qualities in her. Benigna will purchase merchandise with the money that she requests, such as soft drinks at the wholesale price of 200 soles.  500 soles will be spent on non-perishable groceries, and the rest will be used as capital for the preparation of meals for her new business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":255422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T15:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benigna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228392},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423627},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116895},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011817},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595410},{"amount":53.62,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989651}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T18:24:21Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Lucas","image":133535}},{"id":87831,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena K. is 49 years old.

This will be his fifth year in private practice. He used to work for the government Ministry of Health. \r\n<p>\r\nOn average, Johnstone sees 80-90 clients a month, depending on what services are needed. All of his clients are farmers and he says most struggle to pay even the lowest bills. He says another challenge is gaining the trust of his patients, who often are more used to traditional medicine. He is asking for 50,000 KES to purchase some instruments.\r\n<p>\r\nJohnstone's favorite parts of the practice are the curative and dental

Her business is an eatery setup in her house. She sells hot dogs, hamburgers, pastries, drinks, sodas, juices, coffee and also rents her phone. Thank God, her business has been growing with help form two of her children and they have many customers. With the previous loan, she was able to buy two doors for her living room. Now she wishes to buy welding materials to build a metal gate at the entrance of her house to improve her security; since crime threatens the neighborhood, completing this work is a necessity. Her short-term goals are to build a separate space for her eatery (since she now cooks in her home\u2019s kitchen) and provide better service for her customers.

This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizer such as manure.\r\n\r\nVeronica is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital for her business. This loan will be her third from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

She lives with her children in a large extended traditional family in Kabo\u00efla II, in the centre of Sikasso (the Republic of Mali's third administrative region). \r\n\r\nMrs. B.  had many unsuccessful business ventures but finally decided to set up a restauration business over 15 years ago with a neighbor in the district. She carries out her business every day in Kabo\u00efla II opposite Soro Yiriwaso's Sikasso branch and is in great demand from her customers for the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy ever growing customer demand, she decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, around two years ago and she is now on her third loan from the institution; her two previous loans were repaid in full. This third loan will allow her to improved the quality of her service by buying more bush meat from hunters in the towns surrounding Sikasso, 45kg of fresh fish, 60kg of beans, 25 chickens, one sack of potatoes, 25kg of green beans etc..\r\n\r\nShe sells her meals for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of women, young single people and above all, nightowls. Her restauration business is going wonderfully well, particularly the sale of bush meat which is appreciated by the working population. She expects to make a monthly profit of 150,000FCFA, which will be used essentially to increase her business, contribute to family expenses and pay the interest on her loan.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":651790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of ingredients for restauration","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T16:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752131},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606392},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918040},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360966},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226275},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301140},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580747},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":26143.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750656}],"funded_date":"2010-11-26T17:19:09Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":256667,"name":"Antonio Jr","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonio Jr B. is from the town of Western Pob.Lopez  Jaena.

She has two years of experience in this business. Amilani needs a loan of 1,500 Somoa Tala (WST) to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 350 WST or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Amilani joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Amilani's 2nd loan with SPBD. \n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She is pregnant and her husband, who is a policeman, is currently stationed in the jungle.  For the past 7 years she has had a small kiosk along the Panamerican highway at the exit where she lives.  There, she offers various fruits and beverages to the drivers who frequent the area.  She tells us that this work is an important help to the family's economy and it keeps her busy during the day.

However, none of the children are dependent on her. Evelyne lives by herself and supports herself independently. About a dozen years ago, she moved to the Allomey district in Allada, in the Atlantic Prefecture of Benin. She has been selling ice cream and soft drinks in Allada for about five years. As a secondary business activity, she also sells jewelry. She purchases her goods in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.

To make a living, Elsa owns and operates a retail clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general clothing services to local community members. Elsa has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 1,900 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Elsa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Elsa is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Elsa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The income she earns helps her to pay for the education expenses of her daughter. She is the mother of a son and a daughter. Her daughter is in 8th grade, while her son is 5 years of age and has not yet started going to school.\r\n<p> \r\nHer husband runs a grocery shop in a market, where he sells regularly used groceries, specifically rice, spices, and cooking oil. His shop is located in a place where he faces crowds of people every day. To fulfill the needs of the people and increase his customer base, he has to maintain his stock of groceries. But, currently, he doesn\u2019t have enough stock, and due to this he is going to lose his customers day by day, which is not good for his business. Therefore, Yasmeen has decided to acquire a loan from Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. The loan will help her husband buy the required groceries for his shop and overcome the business problems as well. She is very hopeful that her husband will once again bring his business to the top by increasing his profit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":586030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase groceries for a grocery shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Borewala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.719444 70.997222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasmeen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suraiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172069207},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360296},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182494975},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188629888},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372817},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790271},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232057},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098499},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211168902},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451646},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.8,"processed_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221615601}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T18:59:35Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:16:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aya Padr\u00f3n","image":275073}},{"id":227994,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Kiva borrower is a 48-year-old married woman from Lebanon.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

There, she has a business through which she sells merchandise that she buys in cash or by advanced order and then offers on credit.  From a young age, Yaniris dreamt of being independent and managing her own money.  For this reason, she sold clothing door-to-door by means of specialized products.  Little by little, she added cosmetics and, later, accessories, managing to attract customers that currently make up part of her loyal client base.\r\n\r\nShe displays her well-stocked merchandise in a display case at her house, as she also sells in cash.  Her challenge is having little working capital to respond to the demands of her customers in a timely manner.  This is why she is requesting her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy clothing and scents particularly for men because Father\u2019s Day is near.  Because of this family commemoration, Yaniris having merchandise to exhibit will allow her to augment her income since customers will need to find gifts for their fathers at her business.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to have a store that is well stocked with a variety of goods in order to increase her income, while attending to the education and rearing of her son and helping her husband with the management of their household.

C., a 38-year-old mother of five children from Lower Masagana, Lun Padidu, Malapatan, Sarangani Province. Her husband is a farmer and helps her manage their charcoal business. Since all of their five children are young students, they need to work hard to be able to pay the school fees and other needs.\r\n\r\nTheir charcoal business started in 2003. With only PHP 10,000 starting capital, Adelfa began managing the business and making it flourish. Her profit is what she uses to feed all of their children. She is so lucky to have so many friends. Her people skills increase her sales as she markets her products. \r\n\r\nShe still wants to avail a loan from CEVI. She needs additional capital to buy charcoal and sell them later on. Adelfa also wants to find another line of business. This would be to augment and better contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nAs a client, Adelfa is receiving credit assistance, trainings, and insurance coverage from

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fish to the local community. Reybeth has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Reybeth joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Reybeth is now requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be her third from GDMPC. Reybeth plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

for her family, especially her children. Nenita lives in Prk Masinadyahon and is married to a pensioner, Victor C.. They have six children who are grown and have their own families, with a total of 19 grandchildren. In spite of her age, she continues her business because this is the bread and butter of her family.  \r\n\r\nHer husband used to work as a carpenter in a milling company with an income that was not enough to compensate for household expenses. She engaged herself in different types of businesses like fish vending, farm work, selling of native delicacies from other barangays and would do laundry for their neighbor to help her husband with expenses. At the wee hours of the morning, Nenita would start her daily routine of taking care of her children while preparing for her businesses. In 1999, she became a member of NWTF-PD and her loan was used for her general store which was adjacent to her house. She also sold different viands to her husband's company. With this additional income for her family, she was able to send her children to school. Luckily, her business did well and she was able to earn PHP 9,000 that month, which was used for savings and to defray some family expenses.\r\n\r\nNenita continues to loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 was used as an additional capital for her general store.  She paid for this particular loan on time without any delay. Borrowing the same amount of PHP 15,000, she will be buying additional working inventory for her general store and the income from it will be used for family improvements and other investments.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

SPBD's loans are Connie's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Connie S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a person with a great desire to succeed who dreamt of having a store; she managed to achieve this with God\u2019s help and her husband\u2019s support.  She has been able to overcome challenges because she is a very entrepreneurial woman who, with great effort, has managed to grow her business.  She distributes her products in various areas in Comalapa, the area she\u2019s from, and has a vehicle that allows her to distribute her merchandise.  Being able to do this has helped her increase her earnings, but she needs additional working capital so she can stock more products to meet customer demand.  At this time, she would like to have a greater variety of products to offer for sale, as well as to provide her children with a higher standard of living so they can become professionals.<br

She earns her living by operating a food vending business. Her husband Joerald Sr., wH. is 42 years old, works as a food vendor at a bus terminal to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children wH. are between 6 and 17 years old. Josephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josephine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Josephine is a Dungganon woman wH. is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community wH. has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in her own house with her 49 year old husband, Silverio, and their six dear children.  She wishes to give them a better quality of life.  Ever since she was very young Marleni has worked with her parents farming the land.  With the years she has managed to buy her own land.  Now she is one of the foremost banana, cacao, yucca, corn, and coffee producers in the Chanchamayo province. \r\n\r\nThis is the place where her buyers come to get her crops.  What she likes best about her work is taking care of her crops, and she does it with much affection.  She has been doing this activity for ten years.  She considers transporting her products to the market to be the most difficult part of her work.

Every morning she leaves to work in her fields in order to make them very productive.  She grows potatoes, peas, carrots, and beans.  She later takes them to sell at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  This is where she sells them wholesale.\r\n\r\nHer crops have given her the income needed to support her family.  That is why she wishes to put all of her efforts into getting ahead in this business.  What she likes the most about her work is taking care of the crops.  She has been doing this for 30 years.  She feels that the most difficult part is transporting her products to Tarma. The bags she takes are very heavy, and they make her very tired.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she also devotes herself to livestock.  She fattens the animals to later sell their meat.  \u201cIt always goes very well for me,\u201d she says.  Her husband advises her.  He works with cattle on other farms, and he earns extra money.  \r\n\r\nThat is why, later on, she wishes to buy new fields in order to increase her production.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Virgen Mar\u00eda Communal Bank.  This is her fifth loan with MFP, where she hopes for their assistance in order to continue on with her objectives.  She pledges, once more, to make her payments as she has done with the previous loans she has had.\r\n\r\nAlso, it pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.  Upon receiving your support she will use the requested money to buy several pigs that cost on the average of 150 soles for each one.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":806481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-10T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712703}],"funded_date":"2011-07-10T21:50:11Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":318165,"name":"Lilibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilibeth is 41 years old and married with one child.
