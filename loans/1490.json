The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare,  double the national average of 14. However, Esther is ambitious and is aiming to reap 35 bags per hectare this season.  When asked how she plans to spend the income she will make as a Babban Gona member, she said, \u201cI plan to use the money  to educate my children. My overall goal is to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs\u201d. With this loan, she is well on her way to achieving these goals.

She buys supplies in the public market in her town because she can get reasonable prices which enable her to be more competitive. Her ambition for the future is to have her own premises and her own home, because she currently has to rent them. She is now applying for a Kiva loan, her first with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy raw materials and supplies such as rice, oil and vegetables. If she has a bit more she will buy a greater amount of stock and that is precisely why her Kiva loan will be an effective investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1650833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is one of the members of Khoken (A) Group. Vahneichong is 40 years old and a mother of four children. To supplement her household income, Vahneichong and her husband cultivate pineapple in the village. They plant more than 8,000 pineapples on their farm. When it gets ripe, they take the pineapple in the bi-weekly market and sell it for 20-30 INR each. With the little profit they get from the business, they maintain the household expenses and the children\u2019s educational expenditures.\n\nVahneichong says she and her husband work very hard to raise their children to get decent jobs and achieve what they want to become in life. All of her children are in pre-secondary school and they are brilliant, says Vahneichong with a smile. The power supply in her village is very irregular and her school-going children cannot study properly after sunset.\n\nTo overcome this, she has to use alternative lighting devices such as candles or buy kerosene oil for the lantern. Now she wants a Kiva solar loan, which will help her to buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system that will light four bulbs for 12 hours a day.

As a Babban Gona member, Shehu, is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Shehu can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Shehu is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 100 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Shehu is hopeful about what the future holds; he  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, he will finally be able to afford to educate his children; Zakariya,  and  Nuhu.

Burul is 38 years old, married, and is raising three children. Burul has a secondary education. She started her career working in a sewing shop. Now she works as a cleaning woman in a hospital. As an additional source of income for her family, Burul has been practicing livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business in 2000 with initial start-up capital in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Burul's hard work, she currently has 1 dairy cow, 1 horse, 2 calves, 8 sheep and 5 goats on her farm. She also has a 1.50 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, clover and beans.

Cholpon has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 16 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Cholpon's hard work, she currently has 1 cow and 10 sheep on her farm, as well as a 1.60 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, clover and beans. This business brings in about 6,000 som (KGS) each month, which has already allowed her to build a house. Cholpon is a member of the group \"Zoogazyn.\" Besides her, there are two other members in the group. For the further development of her business, Cholpon turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 50,000 som (KGS) to increase her number of cattle by buying a calf and mineral fertilizers. Cholpon plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to build a large barn in the near future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":487.5,"image":{"id":1651701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a wife and a mother of two children. Sitora and her family live in a small district of Pyandj. Sitora started a new business in sewing women's clothing to-order one year ago. She learned how to sew a long time ago from her mother. Sitora has been developing her business over the course of a year, trying to help her husband to provide for the family and improve the family's financial condition. Currently, Sitora is not bringing in an income for the family due to a broken sewing machine. She is unable to make the purchase independently and requested this loan.

Chanchale hails from a middle class business family and is a highly ambitious lady.\r\n\r\nChanchale has been running a mobile phone repair and sales center for the last eight years with the help of her husband. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR form this business. With this small income, she hardly manages her family and business investments. She buys mobile phones and spare parts from the wholesale market, which is 150 miles away. Due to her good behavior, timely service and quality products, her business earned a good reputation. But shortage of finances was an obstacle for her to meet the demands of the customers. So she decided to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation by forming the above group for expansion and development of her business. She is planning to purchase a variety of new mobile phones and spare parts to reach out to more customers. She expects a good return from this investment. Chanchale hopes to purchase a computer for her shop and give a better education to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of this group are also doing a variety of micro enterprise businesses for their livelihood.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1651913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile

To provide the primarily source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry since 2003. She also owns 1 hectare of land, where she grows perennial herbs as a livestock feed. Orozbubu's business contains 3 cows and 2 calves. Sales of milk, milk products and resale of livestock yield approximately 5,000 som (KGS) per month. Also, Orozbubu's husband provides combine harvester operator services during the season. In order to further develop her business, Orozbubu requested a loan in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to increase livestock headcount by buying sheep.

Because of that, she is sometimes limited in investing in a better stock for her store, which is the reason why she is applying for a loan to purchase stock of basic family market basket products, such as grains, groceries, and snacks, with which she will be able to continue having regular sales and projecting an expansion of her business and converting it to something bigger and more profitable.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1651827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stock of products for the basic family market basket","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Antonio de Prado","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-07-25T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-24T02:30:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87148},{"due_date":"2014-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":89568},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":92056},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":94612},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":97240},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":99941},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":102716},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":105569},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":108501},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111514},{"due_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":114611},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117794},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":121065},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":124427},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":127883},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":131435},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":135085},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":138835}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":741671,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of nine children, Teresita works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a business selling vegetables in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from a meat shop.

It consists of 13 rural poor women members who belong to the Below Poverty Line category. This group is located in a remote rural village named Gambhariguda in the Nuapada district of Odisha, India. Jayanti, a 36-year-old lady, is one of the members of this group who is sitting with her hand raised. She is a very active and hardworking woman. She lives with her husband and four children.\r\n\r\nJayanti has a vegetable cultivation farm. She and her husband manage the farm. Her husband is an active and cheerful farmer. They produce vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, carrots, cabbage, chilies, cucumber, papaya, lady fingers, onions etc on the farm. She sells her products to the traders in the nearest town who come to take vegetables from her farm. Jayanti earns a monthly income of 6,000 INR from this business, which is insufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family as well as the farm expenses.  Jayanti wants to expand her farming but due to a lack of funds, she is not being able to do that. Therefore, she wants to take a loan of 16,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation through her SHG. She has planned to use the present loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides and a diesel pump set for lifting water for her farm. She expects a good return from her business by expanding her cultivation. Jayanti dreams of constructing a house and digging a deep bore well for a better irrigation facility for her farm. She also hopes to give her whole family a bright future through her hard work. \r\n\r\nAmong the other 12 members,  five are doing vegetable cultivation and vending, one member is doing a cycle store business, four members are doing  a general store business and two members are doing a cloth vending business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1652218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides and a diesel pump set for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"GAMBHARIGUDA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-25T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-24T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalpana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khulana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pushpa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jemani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukhani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mejati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":208000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":208000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T13:51:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":741673,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma is thankful for the financial assistance extended to her as she was able to buy more grocery items for her variety store.

Her children are helping her financially.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Ma. Linda wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to take a loan of 10,000 PHP (Philippine pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. \r\n\r\nMa.

unsurpassed.  This 55-year old man at first started a business selling fast food in Cali.  However, due to health problems, he decided to give up the business. \r\nBut something peculiar happened to this happily married father of four children.  Generally, it is the parents who pass on their knowledge to the children and teach their children their profession.  But in this story, the roles were switched.  One of Gerardo's children, after finding out about his father's condition, decided to bring Gerardo to his city.  He taught his father how to sell household merchandise, like sheets, pillows, quilts and other items.  Business has been going very well for Gerardo.  He works with an employee to distribute the merchandise in various neighborhoods.  He generally sells on credit, and so getting his money is slow.   \r\nGerardo is requesting a loan to stock up on merchandise and to be able to buy it wholesale.  He wants to buy a better car so he can reach more areas and fit more of his stock in it.  He has given himself the goal of one year to make good on that commitment.

Portoviejo is a place known for its hardworking people who dedicate themselves to agriculture and raising livestock.  <br \/><br \/>Don Wilmer lives in this place.  He is 30 years old, in a common-law relationship, and has three children (ages 12, 8, and 6) who are in either high school or elementary school.  His wife is a cashier.  <br \/><br \/>Sr. Wilmer is a hardworking man who enjoys putting in the effort to help his family get ahead.  He works Monday through Friday at a distribution center that sells plastic goods.  In his free time, he also sells plastic goods since he can get them at a much cheaper price.  He travels throughout the city and places nearby in order to sell plastic cases, serving platters, plates, spoons, and other products.  This allows him to earn some extra income since his salary is not enough to help his family move forward.  Wilmer has already been in this business for six years and he has been able to get ahead.  <br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to restock his business with more inventory.

He has a small grocery shop adjacent to their house, which is the only source of income for their family. He sells daily necessities like sugar, rice, flour, biscuits, bread, eggs etc.  At first, his business was not going well, but now he is able to turn the tide in his favor and is making good sales these days.

She is 48 years old and studied still grade 6. She lives with her three sons and husband, Pradeep, 54 years old, in the small village Khagrabari in Maynaguri in the district of Jalpaiguri. They have a kachha house (mud, straw and bamboo made). Sadhana's husband attended school up to grade 6. He is a car driver and by doing this he earns for the family. Due to poverty they could not provide better education to their sons and now they are grown up and work as laborers on daily wages.\r\n\r\nSadhana always prioritizes her children's future, which is why she has not gotten tired of doing things to give them a better way of life. Sadhana has her grocery store within the locality, where biscuits, bread, butter, spices, flour and other kinds of grocery items are sold. She has chosen this business as there is no other grocery store in her locality.\r\n\r\nNow she aims to improve her grocery shop due to the increasing demands of her customers. But to expand her business, she needs capital. So she applied for a loan from BJS to buy grocery items to meet the demands of her customers and at the same time, improve her financial stability and impart a decent life to her family.\r\n\r\nShe wants to save money from the profit generated from her business and aspires to purchase a car of own in the future.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to both BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1652250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase items for her grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-07-25T13:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-24T13:10:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadhana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-28T04:01:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}}]}
