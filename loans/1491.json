When asked how he plans to spend the income he will make this year  as a Babban Gona member, he said, \u201cI plan to use the money  to expand my farmland.\u201d Shaibu is not thinking about this year alone, he expressed that his long-term goal is to \u201cbecome the most profitable farmer in my community\u201d.

She takes order for cutting patterns and sewing custom-made clothes. Her services are not very expensive, so Hamida works a lot to make more profit. She has worked on one sewing machine for many years and her machine has become completely outdated.

village. Muhaiyo is married and has three children. Muhaiyo grew up in a family with many children. Her parents worked all day to provide their children with all of the necessities. Muhaiyo has been accustomed to hard work since childhood. Muhaiyo started her own business when she was young. She earned the start-up capital for the business working in the fields. She started small, transporting merchandise from the city and reselling it out of her home. Little by little, she increased her sales turnover and opened a small store near her house where she sells groceries. Muhaiyo's husband works as a foreman in a construction brigade in Russia and every season he leaves to work abroad. The store serves as her main source of income as her husband does not always earn money in Russia.

","en":"Dilovar is a 34-year-old woman. She has three wonderful children and a loving husband. Dilovar lives in the countryside, where the income level is very low, which is why women go to work as well as men. From early in her childhood, Dilovar helped her father look after their sheep and put them out to pasture in the field. That is how Dilovar fell in love with this profession. Dilovar has a lot of work experience in this sphere. Dilovar's husband practices crop farming on their small plot of land. He also seasonally works abroad in the Russian Federation. But the money that her husband contributes is not enough to cover all of the family's needs. Because cattle are currently very cheap and the demand for cattle has dropped, Dilovar turned to \"Arvand\" for financial assistance. With the received funds, Dilovar wants to buy cattle feed and a young cow to expand her business. Dilovar thanks MDO Arvand, LLC in advance for their provided financial support to the poorest segment of the population."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1649473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle feed and a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

three children. Sohibjon was born in a rural area, to a peasant family and helped his father grow crops since childhood. He watered, weeded and guarded the family fields. Sohibjon never received a proper education as his parents couldn't afford it. This is Sohibjon own words: \"I loved cars since childhood and helped the local mechanic repair automobiles in secret from my father. I learned my trade from this man\". When Sohibjon became an adult, he decided to open his own automotive repair shop. However, he had no savings, so decided to travel to Russia as a migrant worker to save up money. Once he had earned enough capital to start, he finally opened his shop and started fixing cars. This is now the main source of income for his family. Sohibjon wants to provide well for his family and assure his own children will get a good education. Sohibjon wants to expand his shop and purchase spare parts. For this he needs financial assistance, so he has turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan.

He lives in a remote village and raises cattle for meat. As a child, he started with his brother to pasture cattle. For a small fee he and his brother would take the neighboring livestock into the meadows while their neighbors worked in the fields. Horim never finished high school and he had no opportunity to receive formal education. Instead Horim is now an independent rancher who raises meat cattle and resells them at the market. Recently Horim used the savings from his business to build a new house for his family. But, due to seasonality of animal sales, Horim's business is currently not as profitable and he is worried that he will not be able to finish the house before the cold weather arrives. He has turned to \"Arvand\" with this problem. He will use the loan to finish building the house and move his family into the new building. Horim plans to use the loan to purchase building supplies.

She is married and has two children. She has a high school education and is honest, hardworking, and responsible. Since she was young, she has been used to working and being independent. Like all residents of rural areas, she and the other children worked in the fields. She did not receive a good education and did not have the opportunity to get a good job. After finishing high school, Charos decided to go into business. She got up early and went to the city to buy products and then sold them at the local market. As Charos says herself, \"At first I just bought a few shirts and pairs of socks and started with almost nothing, but I gradually increased my sales turnover and got to my feet.\" She is now selling clothing full time. Her husband works seasonally in Russia and tries to provide for his family as best he can. His earnings are not enough to provide for the family and give the children a good education, which is Charos's dream. She applied for a loan with Arvand for the financial support to increase her sales turnover. She plans to buy new varieties of children's clothing. She thanks Arvand in advance for the assistance it provides to low-income rural residents.

He is married and has 3 children. He came to Arvand for the first time once he learned that there was an opportunity to obtain financial support. Mamadnazar lives with his family in a rural area. He does not have a higher education. Mamadnazar's wife also does not have a higher education because she did not have an opportunity to study at a university due to family's financial hardships, and is now a homemaker, involved in household work and raising the children. Since a young age, Mamadnazar had helped his father to raise livestock and this is how he gained a lot of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nToday, in order to have a good income for living, Mamadnazar is independently involved in his own business. He fattens up and sells cattle. His wife also helps him with the business by selling milk, obtained from the livestock. Now, Mamadnazar wants to increase his livestock headcount in order to expand his business. This is why he came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock. Mamadnazar hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the support in

She is married, but does not yet have children due to her health conditions. She lives in a small rural village. Since childhood, Shoira dreamed of becoming a teacher, but circumstances did not allow her to get a higher education due to financial difficulties in her family. Shoira was married off right after graduating from secondary school. And this is how she became a homemaker, but even while always staying at home, Shoira did not sit without doing anything. She and her husband try to do everything possible to provide themselves and their parents with all of the necessities.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a regular income for living, Shoira and her husband started their own business. They are involved in animal husbandry. Shoira raises livestock and then sells milk and meat obtained from the livestock. Shoira earns a good income from this business. Shoira's husband also works at a local repair shop, and his work yields an additional income for the family. Their combined income is sufficient to live at a middle-class level, but they still do not have enough to cover all of their needs. Currently, Shoira and her husband want to buy several more heads of livestock for fattening up. This is why Shoira came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock. Shoira thanks Arvand in advance for the support that would subsequently improve the family's quality of

Thanks to her hard work, Nazgul was able to develop and expand her business, which today yields approximately 20,000 som (KGS) per month, and serves as the basis for covering food and consumer needs of the family. The earnings from the business allowed Nazgul to start building her own house. In order to complete the construction, Nazgul requested a loan from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to install a heating system, to create a water supply for drinking needs, and also to provide indoor and outdoor wall linings. In the future, Nazgul plans to increase livestock headcount, so that the resulting profit would help raise and educate her children in good conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1653910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He is not yet married, but planning to soon. This is why he is investing all of his soul into his work. Nurkabool lives with his parents in a small house in a rural village. He is involved in his own business in order to support his family.\r\n\r\nNurkabool is involved in farming and animal husbandry. He has a land plot, part of which is rainfed and part is irrigated land. Nurkabool grows carrots, potatoes and cereal crops in this land. His parents and younger brothers help him to care for and raise livestock. Because their land plot is large, they also use it for livestock pasture. The animal husbandry business yields a good income, and this is why Nurkabool wants to expand this business by increasing livestock headcount. This is why he came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock. Nurkabool thanks Arvand in advance for the financial assistance and hopes very much for a positive result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":303.05,"image":{"id":1649469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Yryskan is 50 years old, married and raising 5 children together with her husband. Yryskan has a secondary education and, to provide the primary source of income for her family, is involved in animal husbandry. Thanks to her hard work, today her business contains 6 cows, 4 sheep, and also 0.50 hectares of owned land, where she grows corn. The monthly income is approximately 15,000 som (KGS). Her husband and younger children actively help her with the business. They try to invest their savings into developing and expanding the business, and also into improving their living conditions. Yryskan already filled the foundation of their future, spacious house with cement, but still needs money to buy bricks, slates and other construction materials. In order to complete the construction of the house for herself and her family, Yryskan requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank. Yryskan plans to invest the earnings from her business into further developing her animal husbandry activity because she wants to build a house for her

is an example of an ambitious and successful young Yemeni man. In spite of the prevailing depression and frustration in the country, he is able to build his own future.\r\n\r\nBassam is 29 years old single man who lives in Sana'a, Yemen. He holds a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Because Bassam has great belief in himself and his abilities, he was able to get a job in a pharmacy. Getting a job was a very important stage in his life since it enabled him to get experience and accumulate some money. \r\n\r\nUnlike most of his peers, he wasn\u2019t thinking of getting married and building a family in the time being. He was focused in starting up his own business and securing his future. After working for some years in a pharmacy, two months ago he opened  his own pharmacy. Although opening a pharmacy can mean large profits, it takes a relatively large investment to get off the ground, especially in Yemen where there are many pharmacies in the city, and to meet the demand of customers, most if not all medicines should be available. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately Bassam doesn\u2019t have the required capital to do that, so he applied for a loan in the amount of 1,400,000 YER from Al-Amal Microfinance Bank to purchase medicines. Bassam is sure that this loan will help him a lot and assist him to go on in his business. Bassam looks forwards to expanding his business and opening more branches in different locations in the city.

This is Terry\u02bcs micro-distribution center (MDC), where he sells Coca-Cola products at wholesale to local retailers.\r\n\r\nMDCs are a distribution model that was developed by The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s (TCCC) bottler in Ethiopia in 1999 as an innovative way to get their products to hard-to-reach urban areas. The model relies on a network of independently owned MDCs that are run by local entrepreneurs. In Zambia, entrepreneurs must invest approximately $2,500 to purchase the container and another $3,000 to stock it full of drinks to become an MDC. Today, the MDC channel represents 47% of Coca-Cola\u02bcs distribution channel in Zambia.\r\n\r\nTerry is 33 years old and became an MDC in June 2009 because he did not have any job security where he was working at the time. \u201cEmployment opportunities in the country were next to zero,\u201d Terry explains. Since that time he and his wife Thandiwe have opened another location in Chazanga, and the income from the two MDCs support them and their two young children.\r\n\r\nTerry has requested a Kiva loan so that he can order more stock for his shipping container. This will help him increase his stock and high turnover will bring him additional profit.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Alh. Usaini is ambitious and is aiming to reap 57 bags per hectare this season. When asked how he plans to spend the income he will make as a Babban Gona member, he said, \u201cI plan to use the money to educate my children. My overall goal is to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\u201d With this loan, he is well on his way to achieving these goals.

They are doing a survey on the elimination of poverty, which will allow them to improve their living conditions through their effort and work.  \r\n\r\nOn of the group's members is Nelida, who has a well-stocked small grocery store in her home, which she has been building up through a lot of hard work.  She tells us that in the beginning it was very hard for her, but that she has been making progress and now she has a very good clientele. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to buy various supplies for her small grocery store, such as meat, drinks, dairy products, baked goods, and more, and thereby maintain her sales as she has been.

However, Sosorbaram didn't give up on his dream of a better life. He works very hard; he almost always travels between districts searching for delivery jobs. His wife is currently unemployed and stays at home, cooking and doing domestic work. Their son goes to high school and will graduate next year. The house his family lives in has been deteriorated over the years, and it needs some repair.

She has a specialized secondary education in accounting.  As the main source of income for her family, Munduz has been raising livestock and growing crops since 1995.  Thanks to her hard work, Munduz now has one dairy cow and 20 sheep, as well as a 2.28 hectare plot of land where she rows beans to sell.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few tractors and a bean-cleansing combine harvester, which Munduz and her husband rent out to the neighbors for a bit of additional income.  Their monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of increasing her business, Munduz has turned to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 110,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and a horse with a foal.  She plans to use this loan to further increase her head of livestock, and she also plans to buy some items that will improve her children's living condition."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1563.63,"image":{"id":1654011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sheep and a horse with a foal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-26T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-25T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":76.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munduz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":977.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":586.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":928.37,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50550.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":48.9,"payment_id":595436354},{"amount":558.57,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":30330.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.79,"payment_id":664995375}],"funded_date":"2014-08-20T16:28:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":742118,"name":"Eufrocina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eufrocina is a married woman with ten children.
