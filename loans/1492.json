Concepcion is taking out a housing loan amounting PHP 9714.20 to purchase building materials and pay for construction labor in order to build a house for her family. Concepcion has been with NWTF since 2012, and plans to recover through her fish vending business. With your help, Concepcion can rebuild her house and rebound from the devastation of Super Typhoon Haiyan. In future, she would like to save enough money to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":63,"image":{"id":1652908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

As a Babban Gona member, Garba Lauya is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Garba Lauya can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Garba Lauya is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 35 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Garba Lauya is hopeful about what the future holds; he  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, he will finally be able to afford to educate his children; Jamilu,  and Wasila.

Ashiru joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Adamu, Tasiu  and  Buhari. Ashiru is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. For the first time, Ashiru will have access to quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed. Without this loan, he would  be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive, but are often diluted with external products like sand.

She is a 41-year-old mother who is caring, loving and very hardworking. Florence is a mother of two beautiful children and she hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns in the world and favors dairy and crop farming. \r\n\r\nFlorence was raised in a very humble background, and this made her work extra hard so that she would get out of the poverty levels that she was facing. Florence was taught to be hardworking by her parents, and this has really helped her because she has been practicing farming for the past three years, and through farming, she has taken care of her family. Although she has been making profits, life has not been that easy, and due to increased living conditions, Florence started dairy farming. The business has really picked up, and she is now seeing \u201clight at the end of the tunnel.\u201d Because of this reason, Florence wants to buy more dairy cows; that is why she is seeking a loan of 31,200 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Florence is sure that she will be able to fully utilize the space in her farm and also satisfy the demand for milk in her area, which is very high. Profits from selling the milk will be used in improving her living conditions and providing a solid education system to her children. The dairy cow will also provide manure that will be used in her farm to increase productivity.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1652972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-26T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-25T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1959.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2310.81},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2396.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2437.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2522.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2571.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2640.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2749.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2785.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2868.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2938.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3019.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.22,"local_amount":5675.63,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5989.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054383},{"amount":34.87,"local_amount":2901.09,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3061.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547570},{"amount":38.17,"local_amount":3175.38,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3350.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680556},{"amount":36.38,"local_amount":3026.77,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3194.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624835},{"amount":33.66,"local_amount":2800.31,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2955.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193909},{"amount":99.16,"local_amount":8250.26,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8706.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636263987},{"amount":61.35,"local_amount":5370.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5667.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.19,"payment_id":681376976}],"funded_date":"2014-07-26T19:07:54Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":742197,"name":"Leona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leona lives at Tuguegarao with her family.

She has a high school education and she raises livestock, which is the family's main source of income.  She started this four years ago with the sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, Aiymbubu now has 20 sheep and two horses, as well as a 2.15 hectare plot of land, on which she grows sainfoin.  As an additional source of income for her family, she sews blankets and mattresses and sells them to the local residents.  Her total monthly income is about 20,000 som (KGS).

Her main income is from agriculture and raising livestock, which she started doing in 1985.  Thanks to her diligent and capable work, Kaliya has had many successes in increasing her business and she is able to bring in a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).  Now her farm has five dairy cows, two horses and 100 sheep, as well as a 2.40 hectare plot of land, where she grows sainfoin and peppers.  There is also a tractor on the farm, which Kaliya's husband rents out to the local residents.  With the goal of developing her business further, Kaliya has turned to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 65,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow, a calf and mineral fertilizer.  She plans to use the income from this loan to further increase the head of livestock on her farm, and she also plans to make repairs on her home in the

She is excited about the opportunity this will bring her to increase her income and improve the livelihood of her family. \r\n\r\nMercy will set up her booth in one of Lusaka\u2019s most densely populated locations, an area called Chawama. She says by setting up the business in this location, people in that area will no longer have to go into the town centre to access financial services. When Mercy gets her loan, she will use it to purchase a trading booth and a mobile phone which she can use to service her customers. \r\n\r\nMercy is confident that her life will change once she starts running her own business, she  sees the business as a way to empower some of her family members who are not employed.  She explains how being given this opportunity means a lot to her and she will work hard to grow her business, expand to new areas, and earn more income to support her family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1653094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a trading booth and a mobile phone which she can use to service her customers.

They live in their own small house in the village of Sarkarpara in Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri.  Minati lost her husband a few years ago.  From then until now, she has had to look after her sons and earn for the family.  She has to struggle a lot to earn income for her family. Her sons are students. One is in grade eight and the other is in grade five. \r\n\r\nHer husband was a small farmer who used to grow seasonal vegetables on their own farmland. They had to face so many challenges in life, including inadequate capital to successfully carry out his business activity and inadequate finances to educate their children and provide them with other basic necessities. \r\n\r\nAfter her husband's death, Minati has been continuing the business. But the income from the agricultural activities is hardly sufficient for maintaining all the expenses of her family. So, she has decided to cultivate paddy, as it has a very good market demand.\r\n\r\nMinati has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to fulfill her purpose.

She is a young, energetic and active entrepreneur of 46 years.  She lives with her husband and one son in the small village of Dangapara in Jalpaiguri district. Nurjahan's husband Abdul, 54 years old, is a land cultivator by profession. Nurjahan and her husband both have an elementary education. Due to poor economic conditions, they could not provide an education to their only son who is now working with his father in his agribusiness.\r\n\r\nNurjahan's husband, together with their son, cultivates different crops on their farmland.  Their meager income cannot cover all the necessary expenses for the family. Because of the scarcity of financial resources, Nurjahan has always been forced to look for the other revenue sources. So, for the last few years she has been raising cows. She supplies cow's milk to her neighborhood.  She is now an important financial support for the family.  She has only one cow in her herd. But in order to improve her dairy business, she wants to purchase one more cow, which will provide her with more milk to sell. Nurjahan and her family really need financial support to realize their goals.\r\n\r\nSo, she has asked for a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy one more dairy cow. She will supply milk to more clients not only to satisfy the demand of her customers but to strengthen the family's economy.  She hopes to save money little by little from the profit generated to construct a better house for them.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful for both BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1653188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-07-27T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-26T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurjahan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-07-27T15:55:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":743640,"name":"Fazilat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0424\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 20 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0424\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e-\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 7500 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0435.

","en":"Komila graduated from technical school with a specialty in hydrometry. After getting married she had to leave her profession and start an animal husbandry business, since her salary was so small. She has been feeding cows and selling milk and dairy products for many years. Income from this business helps her to improve her children's diet and to offer them a healthy and fulfilling quality of life. Komila has three children; the oldest daughter studies in college and helps her mother with the animals in her free time. Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia who doesn't send money regularly. Therefore Komila doesn't depend on money sent from her husband and tries to take care of herself. This year she and her husband decided to build a new house, but since it's an expensive endeavour, she has turned to IMON for a loan of 10,000 somoni to buy cement, bricks and other necessary materials. She awaits your kindness and hopes for your charity."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1654937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

With experience in agricultural work, she has been able to get ahead despite the difficulties that have risen along the way, including rising costs of inputs and the instability of the prices for buying and selling vegetables. \r\n\r\nAs her son has grown up and the family expenses are increasing day by day, she feels likely to further improve her agricultural activities.  She has decided to cultivate paddy, which is an all-season crop, the staple food of West Bengal and in much demand throughout the year, so it will be a profitable business for her to generate income.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Renuka is requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers etc. to start paddy cultivation.

As a Babban Gona member, Yahuza is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Yahuza can earn up to $2,000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags per hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Yahuza is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will result in a yield of at least 60 bags of maize per hectare this season.

The group is made up of nine members and is directed by a board where Guillermina is the President. The businesses that the members have are varied, among them are: milk sales, the sale of cookies and balloons, the sale of quinoa and clothes, blanket weaving, food sales, carpet sales, and transportation services.\r\n\r\nThe loan that is being requested will benefit small entrepreneurs where Guillermina is a member. She mentions that this is the first time she has worked with Pro Mujer, she joined because of an invitation from a client of the institution that went to visit her in her home. Currently she has a business selling \"pesque\" (a food made of quinoa); she indicated that she started this business many years ago. She learned how to make the dish from her mother, and when she got married she decided to use this culinary art as a way to make money.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy quinoa at wholesale. She will purchase it from the salespeople in her community and then use it in her business for her sales. This work allows her to generate the means to support her family, as she lives in a common-law marriage and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she stated that she likes the life assurance the institution offers.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is not pictured in the photo because she has to travel all of a

She is mother to two teenagers and a young boy, and she alone is in charge of providing the children with proper living conditions. She pays for her eldest son's university studies, as well as English classes for her daughter because she doesn't have enough for her university tuition too. Her youngest son is in elementary school, and all three children are honor-roll students. Ana has been able to achieve this thanks to her work as a merchant. She has a neighborhood clothing store for all kinds of people, and her children help her so she can go out to sell the articles her different customers desire. Ana is requesting this loan to invest in merchandise, especially for Mother's Day, when she is certain her sales will increase since she offers a variety of women's products.
