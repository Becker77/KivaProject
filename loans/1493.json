with his father to grow corn, beans and vegetables.\r\n\r\nHe is married and his wife takes care of the household chores and looks after their daughter who is five years old and is starting kindergarten.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been making his living in farming since he was a boy, as his father taught him the ropes of this trade. During the season in which he cannot work due to a lack of rain, he sows vegetables on irrigated land from which he obtains a good income through sales and he sometimes works as a laborer in the morning and tends to his crops in the afternoon. As such, his working day is varied, given that while getting products to sell, he has to find money to support his family.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Jos\u00e9 is seeking from CREDICAMPO, is to buy fertilizers, weed killer and insecticides for all of his crops, as well as to pay for the lease of the land he has toiled, as he doesn't have his own land on which to farm. By having the money, he will be able to secure the land for sowing and so that he will have the products he needs to apply as he doesn't have a lot of time to go and buy them at each and every moment. He needs to have these items ready at home to apply when needed and therein ensure a good production.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 wants his home to be built of a more solid material, as it is currently made of adobe and he wants to give his wife and daughter a better quality of life compared to what he had when he was a child.

She currently sells on the streets and dreams about being able to sell her products at her own house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1653452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials to make shoes.

She has no schooling, since her parents could not send her to school. They lived in a solitary area, where she had to walk for nearly an hour on empty paths to reach the school center. Besides, it was a dangerous place.\r\n\r\nShe was married, but seven years ago, her husband was murdered to steal from him. She had 11 children with him, but several died in the armed conflict. Presently only seven are still alive, of which two girls live with her. They both finished sixth grade, and they have partners, but they live with her.\r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years, Maria has been making a living selling fruits and vegetables in the city. Her work day starts very early in the morning. She leaves home at 4:30am, to be in the city by 5:00am, in order to have enough time to prepare her sales and wait for her clients.\r\n\r\nShe decided on this business in view of the financial situation of her family. They were working, and she decided to find the way to help her husband with the household expenses. When he died, she had to start working with loans to invest in more merchandise, since she had to look for the income to help her with home expenses.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from CrediCampo is to buy fruits and vegetables. With it, she will generate better profits, since she will buy at slightly cheaper prices, thus getting more income from the sales.\r\n\r\nShe wants to keep working in order to always have the income needed to meet household expenses. She also wants all her children to stay very dedicated to their family, as it is today, and to keep a view towards growth.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1653446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-27T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-26T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ester ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":104.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":111.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":127.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.14},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501916}],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T14:22:54Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T11:39:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":742797,"name":"Khoern","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a rural area of the Stoeng Sen district of Kampong Thom province, Khoern is 51 and married with three children, one of whom is still in school.

He is known in his community for his character and his economic activity which show him to be an excellent person due to his good education and service to others. He is a farmer, planting basic grains and raising cattle. He grew up with his father and grandparents and studied through 2nd grade, but his school was 15km from home and back then there was no transportation so he had to quit. Through time, Teodoro acquired experience and a lot of knowledge of agriculture. He began working in the field at age 12 and it has become his main source of income as he now sells about 40% of his harvest and saves the rest for his family's consumption. The land where he works is 2km from his house and one of his sons helps with the work from 7am to 11am when he is not in school. <br \/><br \/>The loan will be used to pay rent on the land where he will grow corn and beans. This way he will have more diversified crops which will give him greater income at harvest time. He will invest the profit from his harvests in making improvements to his home and buying vitamins for his cattle. His goals for the future are to increase his land holdings and diversify his crops, and to buy more cattle. He wants to support his children and give them everything they need to prepare themselves academically; one of them dreams of being a medical doctor, another an engineer, one wants to be a nurse and the youngest a car mechanic. All of this will be achieved through good management and investment of his profits from a new loan. He has a lot of experience in managing agricultural loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1653520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay rent on the land where he grows corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-27T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-26T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803840}],"funded_date":"2014-08-13T01:07:13Z","paid_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Berghaus","image":827418}},{"id":742876,"name":"Kakakuona Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Witress is among the Kakakuona Group members who joined in 2008.

For six years she has been supporting her husband with managing the family with a food business (mamalishe). She runs her business in a unique way - just cooks everything from home, packs into containers and resells them to people by walking office to office. She sells these foods at the bus terminal where there is more congestion of people. She wakes up early in the morning, sells from 7 am to 1 pm daily, and is able to make a good profit daily. \r\n\r\nWitress requests her fifteenth loan to be apportioned among Kakakuona, a ten member group. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan. She used the previous credits that she repaid successfully, to buy food cooking ingredients such as rice, beans, sugar, and meats. She opened a new beauty salon business to grow her income. Witress earned a profit which she used to build and cover part of the school fees. She is so happy with Kiva's support.

Meet Gilbert, 28 years of age, very honest, humble and a very hardworking person. He hails from the Litein area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Gilbert is still single and has so much that he wants to achieve before starting a family; that is why he is focused and dreaming of being successful.<br \/><br \/>Gilbert never got the chance to go to college because of a lack of fees but this never killed the zeal that he had for succeeding and he started farming five years ago on a small plot of farm that he inherited from his parents. Through hard work he has managed to practice crop farming and animal farming and has managed to take care of his parents and also take care of his basic needs. Gilbert grows vegetables, fruits and keeps dairy cows as a source of income. Although Gilbert has been making profits, he has a challenge of timely delivery of products to the market and this has made his profits go down because goods reach the market when they are not fresh and hence fetch low prices.<br \/><br \/>Gilbert comes from an area that has poor feeder roads and this has been a major problem to him. That is why he is seeking a loan of KES 60,000 to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, Gilbert will be able to transport his farm produce to the market and deliver it in a timely manner and hence it will fetch high prices. Vegetables, fruits and milk are perishable products and they require quick delivery to the market, so this motorbike will be so much help. Through timely delivery of his product, Gilbert is sure of increased profits and this will translate to better living conditions and a secure future.<br \/><br \/>Gilbert is very ambitious and he is planning that once he has accumulated more profits he will be able to go back to school and through education he will be able to have a more secure future because education is \u201cthe key to

The loan helped not just in her business but also in the education of her child, who is in college.\r\n\r\nHer income from her business assists the family with its everyday household expenditures. Her husband helps her generate income for their family. \r\n\r\nMilagros has been in this business for more than 10 years. She would like to apply for another loan, of 50,000 Phillipine pesos, to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMilagros hopes that her business will last longer and dreams of buying a vehicle. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

She hails from a remote rural village named Phursund in Nuapada district in Odisha, India. Phursund village is located in one of the most underdeveloped area of Odisha state. Most of the people of this area depend upon cultivation and petty businesses for their livelihood. The lady sitting on the extreme left with her hand raised in the photograph is Kunti. She is a very active and headstrong lady. She lives with her husband and children in a small mud house. She earns a living by selling animals like buffaloes, bullocks and goats in markets with her husband. The income of 4,000 INR per month that she gets from her existing business is not sufficient for maintaining her family. So she was in search of a credit source for the expansion of her business. When Mahashakti Foundation started intervention in her village in April 2014, Kunti organized 11 other women members of her village with similar backgrounds and formed a Self Help Group (SHG) named Maa Thakurani to take a loan. From this loan of 16,000 INR, she wants to purchase more numbers of bullocks, buffalo and goats to sell. As this is the cultivation season and people are in search of bullock and buffalo for cultivation purpose, she hopes that this will help her to earn some extra income to manage her expenses smoothly. In the long run, with her small savings, she hopes to fulfill her dream of repairing her house and purchase some gold. Among the other 11 members of the SHG, six are doing an animal-selling business, three are doing vegetable vending and two members have general store businesses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1653962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Over 3 years ago, Lutfia was conflicted over whether to start working to help her husband provide for the family.  She didn't want to abandon her duties as a homemaker, and eventually settled upon a compromise; she was skilled at sewing, and decided to work out of home as a seamstress.  Lutfia took to her new job with ease, and has continued to grow and expand her business to this day.  All the while, Lutfia has been setting aside money for home repairs.  Their home hasn't been renovated for several years, and she would like nothing more than to move forward with repairs, but her family needs an extra $1000 to get underway.  She views this loan as the only solution to her problem, and will be able to pay it off with her and her husband's combined incomes.  Please help Lutfia if you can.  \r\n\r\n   \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0443\u0442\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u0415\u0439 39 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041b\u0443\u0442\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0441

He is well known for his business and very respected among neighbors and friends.  He is a farmer and every Friday morning buys and sells cattle at the municipal market.  Most of the cattle is low priced and in need of care and recuperation before being sold to butchers.\r\n\r\nJose was raised by parents who taught him good values which have made him an excellent family man and community citizen.  His family comprises his wife and three children who attend school in the community.\r\n\r\nJose learned about agriculture through his parents and he acquired experience by working in the trade.  It is one of his main sources of income.  He also buys and sells cattle at the Friday municipal market.  His eldest son goes with him and is getting training in the business.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy low priced cattle to be sold for a profit.  The profit will be used to pay off debt and cover household expenses.  Part of the money also will be used to prepare animal feed, since he has enough corn to be processed and turned into flour for the cattle.

Meet Fred, who is 35 years of age and a very courageous man and a hard worker. Fred hails from the Kisii area of Kenya, an area that is a highland and has good rainfall patterns. Fred has four children who he really adores and cherishes so much, and a beautiful wife who always paints a smile on Fred\u2019s face. \r\n\r\nFred practices mixed farming and has been doing this for the past ten years. Through the profits, he has been able to earn a decent and honest living. Fred generates income through milk-selling, egg-selling and personal business. Through these ventures, he has been able to take his children to school and afford a plate of food.\r\n\r\nFred has planted so many trees in his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow. As a result of this, Fred has been making a lot of profits through milk-selling. The demand has really increased, and he cannot sustain it. That is why he is requesting kindly for a loan of KES 67,600 to be able to buy a dairy cow and increase his number of dairy cows, so he can take advantage of the demand and market for milk in his area. Through the loan, Fred is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Also, food for his dairy cows will never be a problem because he has planted Napier grass.\r\n\r\nThrough increased profits, Fred is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. Fred, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering the society by being a source of employment.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1654116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She grew up with her father, who worked in agriculture and cattle raising in land of their own. This way she learned farm work and animal husbandry. She lacks education, because at the time she grew up it was difficult to study since her family always had scant financial resources. They worked in agriculture, which became their main source of income to supply their household basic necessities. The lady works in agriculture since she was 12 years old; she worked in vegetable gardens, picked up log, took care of animals, took care of her siblings and did all household chores. All these activities she learned from her father and her grandmother, who taught her good values, which have led her to advance and be a successful woman, a role model for her children and her community. She will use the money to buy fertilizers and improved corn seed, because in winter time she always works her crops with help of her two children. This way she will obtain better production and will be able to assure food and nutrition for her family. This lady's future goals are to see her children graduate from college, since they are now finishing the last years of basic education in their community school.

They are responsible mothers and fathers with children under their care. They are from Sauce, a place located in a remote part of the country. These people are known for being hardworking and responsible, with a desire for personal improvement. They work in different fields, and that is how they make enough money to support their families. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t study due to the poverty that they live with in rural zones, the situation being worse there than in the cities, both in terms of education and living conditions. Thanks to his efforts and his desire to get ahead, the coordinator is Paulino. He buys and rears pigs, which he then resells. He works some eight hours daily, and his business is located at his house. He has to care for the pigs by watching what they eat and cleaning the pen in order to show them off to prospective buyers in a sanitary and clean environment.

He derives income from his business, which consists in selling cold cuts, cheese, and other items, depending on the season. His first business was in the sale of meat products, which he started on a friend's idea, since this friend was working in this industry. It was at a time when Harold needed an income, since he did not have a stable job. Now, he sells different kinds of sausage, mortadella, cheese, botifarra, etc. He sells his wares both cash and on credit directly to customers who own shops in the centre. Harold's goal is to make his business grow and to offer a greater variety of products, in order to earn more money, save, and buy a house. He asks Fundaci\u00f3n Santa Mar\u00eda for his first loan, through Kiva, so as to buy cold cuts to fulfill pending customer orders.

Aliyor plans to increase his working capital and is requesting a loan in the amount of 7500 somoni to buy livestock and achieve this goal.

in Guatemala, a group of 14 hardworking women have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Mariposas Panyebar,\u201d meaning \u201cThe Butterflies of Panyebar.\u201d The Trust Bank is beginning a new loan cycle through Kiva partner Friendship Bridge. It will be their first cycle with Kiva. The ladies share a common goal of improving their quality of life and are committed to seeing their children enjoy a successful future, which includes education.\r\n\r\nFrancisca is the 35-year-old secretary of the Trust Bank. She is married to a farmer and has four children who range in age from nine to 15. Francisca has an animal husbandry business and is also a beekeeper. She is requesting a loan that she plans to invest in a bull as well as feed for him and for a dairy cow. She also needs to buy food for the bees. Francisca is very happy and proud to be involved in Friendship Bridge. She feels empowered with her loan because she is certain that she can make a big difference in the lives of her children, especially being able to meet their educational needs. Her oldest son is very interested in beekeeping and honey production.\r\n\r\nEach of the women of the \u201cLas Mariposas Panyebar\u201d Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge loan officer.

This place has a considerable number of inhabitants in rural areas. In one of these areas, the Trust Bank \"Manzaneras\" was established. Manzaneras means \"women of the apple area.\" The group is composed by 9 beautiful women wearing their traditional outfits.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Manzaneras Trust Bank is Mrs. Juana. At 36 years old, she has zero years of formal education due to the financial situation of her family, and because education for girls was not important during her childhood. Juana is the mother of a baby girl who is a year old. Juana and her husband are working hard to offer a good future for their daughter. \r\n\r\nJuana's business is the design, development, manufacturing and sale of textiles, especially the majestic traditional huipil, as well as shawls of different colors. Due to demand, Juana has seen the need to hire seven more people in order to take all orders. She provides necessary materials, and these people work from home. Juana is requesting a new loan through Friendship Bridge which she will use to buy threads of different colors, and of the highest quality so that her business continues to grow. It currently delivers orders once a month, and she sells by the dozen as well as individual units.\r\n\r\nJuana has spent several years in this business, but until she joined the Friendship Bridge, the business was unable grow because she could not always maintain inventory of materials. Juana also enjoys the trainings delivered once a month by a Friendship Bridge loan officer as part of its program of Micro Credit Plus, which includes loans and non-formal education. During trainings, women learn about empowerment and decision making. For that reason, Juana enjoys leadership development and is currently the president of the group.\r\n\r\nAll women of the Trust Bank Manzaneras appreciate the confidence of the Kiva lenders granting them loans to invest in their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5500,"image":{"id":1653682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

The group is composed of ten women who are starting another loan cycle through Friendship Bridge. They are hopeful that Kiva investors will fund their loan.<br \/><br \/>Maria is the treasurer of the Trust Bank and a member of the Board of Directors. She is forty years old and the mother of four children who range in age from eight to twenty years. Maria designs and creates traditional clothing such as aprons and blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d. She learned how to do this several years ago. She sells what she fabricates and business is going quite well. For this reason, Maria has hired two additional people from her community so that she can meet the demand of her customers. She is requesting a new loan that she will use to purchase supplies for her business, including a variety of good quality thread. She wants to be certain to have enough raw materials on hand. Maria sells her textiles two or three times each week. Her customers are well aware of the high quality of her clothing and they are most faithful. Maria tries to charge a good price, one that is good for her and for her customers.<br \/><br \/>Maria is very enthusiastic as treasurer of the group and wants to improve her leadership skills, which in turn will help her self-esteem. The entire Trust Bank is very excited to begin a new loan cycle that will include additional educational trainings about women\u2019s leadership and women\u2019s rights, business management practices, nutrition, health and hygiene as well as self-esteem. These trainings are given once each month by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer in their own indigenous language in their own rural community. They are quite comfortable with the setting of their meetings and this makes them feel safe to communicate and to participate. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.<br \/><br \/>Both Maria and her colleagues appreciate the confidence of Kiva investors, because the investment helps to build their future by improving their life conditions.

He is married to a retailer and is the father of four children, of whom the youngest is still pursuing his studies.

He has been in this business since 2012.\r\n\r\nGrains constitute an important part of Togolese foods. Developing mills allows for increasing the productivity at this stage, processing corn into cornmeal and thus developing the country\u2019s economic activity. \r\n\r\nKoffi would like to increase the size of his range of mills by adding a mill to those he already owns. To do so, he needs to purchase two generators and different parts, especially pulleys, enabling new mills to be established. His very first loan is being requested for this.\r\n\r\nOf course, Koffi would like to see his business develop progressively and to achieve a certain level of economic prosperity. This will enable him to have higher and stable revenues, so as to do better meeting the needs of his family.
