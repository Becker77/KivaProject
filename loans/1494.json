With her loan, she intends to purchase a 50-kg sack of fertilizer and a container of herbicide and to pay for plowing to maintain 0.5 hectare.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest, the produce is sold to a customer base composed of men and women paying with cash or credit in the village and in SIKASSO. She plans on making an average profit of 51,000 francs CFA per planting. This profit will enable her to pay back her loan with interest and also to help her husband in covering day-to-day expenses. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1645826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and herbicides and to cover the cost of plowing\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Goloniena","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-07-28T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-27T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":64.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nangatio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tioha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natogoma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":210000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":210000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":385.68,"local_amount":210000,"processed_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216278.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":64.32,"payment_id":636515389}],"funded_date":"2014-08-15T10:04:08Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:04:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":738268,"name":"Benkadi 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les 10 membres du groupe  BENKADI 1 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 52 ans, 4 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 SANGOULA MARKALA, un des villages de la commune de NAMPASSO cercle de BLA de la  4\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur 3\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution, les pr\u00eats pass\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est : le riz et arachide  avec NANA,  1\u00e8re femme assise de la droite vers  la  gauche   sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter des intrants, des semences, des petits mat\u00e9riels agricoles et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir : 1,5 hectare. \nLa production sera vendue au niveau du village et \u00e0 BLA, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte, \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019hommes et de femmes. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 145 000FCFA en fin de campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.\n\n","en":"The 10 members of the Benkadi 1 group are married women with an average age of 52 and, on average, 4 children.

Due to scant resources, she began to work at age 15.\r\n\r\nToday she earns a living making treats such as rice pudding,  custards made of beans, fruit or rice, everything derived from milk and beans.  Usually she prepares these sweets in the morning and goes out on foot after lunch to sell them on various city streets,  since people often buy a treat after lunch.\r\nAt this time, Do\u00f1a Leila needs a loan to buy metal sheeting, since she wants to complete the roof of her kitchen.  She asks the Kiva lenders to finance this loan through Ceprodel so she can carry out her purpose.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1474563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy metal sheeting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2014-07-28T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-27T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leila Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":697},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":774.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":820.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":857.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":904.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":946.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.88,"local_amount":697,"processed_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":725.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530005057},{"amount":30.99,"local_amount":774.68,"processed_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-26T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":806.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":544967994},{"amount":32.82,"local_amount":820.58,"processed_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":853.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561630025},{"amount":108.31,"local_amount":2707.74,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-25T10:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2817.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":583281283}],"funded_date":"2014-07-29T13:41:03Z","paid_date":"2014-12-25T10:17:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":742685,"name":"Maria  Dominga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria de 34 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica desde hace varios a\u00f1os a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de tortillas, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia, posee mucha clientela por la amabilidad que tiene a la hora de vender, con lo que obtiene e de sus ventas logra solventar los gastos que se el presentan en su hogar, es madre soltera vive en casa propia con su hijo, ella esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de ma\u00edz por mayor y cal para seguir con la venta y as\u00ed tener junto con su hijo una menor calidad de vida.","en":"Maria, 34 years old, has earned a living for several years by making and selling tortillas.

Her husband and children help her with her business. As an additional income for her family, she has for many years worked with livestock breeding, after having started this business with 35,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Kuldzhan's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow, one bull-calf, 10 sheep and four horses. She also has a plot of land of 5.40 hectares, on which she grows potatoes, sainfoin and cereals for farm use and sales. Her business brings in around 25,000 som (KSG) per month, which is the basis for covering food and household expenses for her family. The income from the business enabled Kuldzhan to give her children a good education. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Kuldzhan turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock. Kuldzhan plans to invest the income from the loan in further improving her business. She would like to purchase purebred milking cows and also, in the future, plans to purchase an apartment.

Latifa lives with her family in their own house. She studied only to elementary level and couldn't complete her study. Latifa's husband is the sole breadwinner of the family and his income is not enough to meet all the family demands.

She is 39 years of age and blessed with four children. Her husband, Raffy, helps her in their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nLyrma also cooks and sells burger and other snack recipes. She needed additional capital so she would like to avail a loan amounting to 11,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional raw products like pork and chicken and seasonings that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nLyrma dreams to open up branches for her business. She also hopes for her children to finish their studies and be able to find jobs fitted for them. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

","en":"Ashurbi is a saleswoman in Qurgan-Tube. She is 47 years old and has two kids and a husband. Three years ago, thanks to support of her girlfriend, Ashurbi began her little business - she purchased a market stall and started selling vegetables.

Her grocery store is located next to a beautiful lake. Alyona had her store for only 9 months and mostly sells various candy and sweets. After the new year Alyona was faced with problems - fewer clients due to the unstable situation in the Eastern Ukraine. But now the sales have began to improve again. Alyona plans to use the loan of 40,000 griven to improve her family's living conditions. She wants to replace the old front door and install a new armored one and also renovate her

She has a high school degree. Zaryl is a calm, steady and hardworking woman. Her husband and her children help her in her business, which was started with 5,000 som (KGS) many years ago. Farming and livestock is the main source of income for the family and they own two milk cows, three calves, three mares as well as 2 hectares of land where they grow oats and hey. Zaryl's farm brings in 5,000 som (KGS) a month, mainly from dairy, meat and animal sales. In order to further expand the herd, Zaryl has turned to \"Bai-Tushum\" bank for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS). She will use the loan to buy sheep and invest the profits back into the farm.

Bhanumati, an energetic lady of 27 years sitting with her hand raised in the photo, is one of them. She is very active and always cheerful. Her family consists of her husband and four children who are continuing their studies.\r\n\r\nFor the last 10 years, Bhanumati is running a clothes-vending business with the help and support of her husband. She purchases ready-made garments and saris from a wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband moves to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her existing business. But the present income is not sufficient to manage the business expenses, household expenses and educational expenses of her children. Bhanumati wants to raise her income by increasing the volume as well as the coverage area. So from the present loan of 16,000 INR, she is planning to purchase some quality fancy garments for selling. Bhanumati assumes that this will definitely generate a handsome extra income. Bhanumati has a dream of saving enough to purchase a bike for smooth movement and to give a better education to her children.\r\n \r\nThe other 15 members of the group are doing various businesses like cloth vending, general store, tailoring center and vegetable vending.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1654447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase fancy garments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"SINAPALI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-07-29T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-28T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhanumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bimale","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ratna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taruni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalpalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyosnamayi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bimala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shashikala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Budhabari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":256000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":256000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-27T04:18:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":743181,"name":"Jadys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jadys tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad y 3 a\u00f1os de tener una comercializadora de helados en todas sus presentaciones; Su padre siempre trabaj\u00f3 en esta misma l\u00ednea y de \u00e9l hered\u00f3 toda su ense\u00f1anza y apoyo para emprender de manera independiente su propio negocio. .

He is asking for a loan so that he can obtain a water pump to help irrigate and expand his vegetable crops.\n\nVegetable gardening is big business for many farmers in Kapiri Mposhi District. Last season Fabiano grew tomatoes, onions and fresh greens that he sold at a large market near the Congolese Border. However, during the dry season in Zambia, growing vegetables becomes very labour intensive. Water needs to be applied to the crops regularly, often brought to the garden by buckets from a nearby well or stream. A water pump would significantly reduce Fabiano\u2019s need for labour and allow him to further expand his gardens.\n\nRent to Own has worked with Fabiano to create a business plan for this gardening season and will deliver the water pump directly to his farm. Rent to Own also provides technical training on how to properly use and maintain the water pump, and will check in to provide support until he has paid off his loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1651700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

For more than 14 years she worked as an operator in a factory that made brooms and rags.  When she left that work, she took the money from her severance pay and invested it in a business.  At first the business was located near a small grocery store, where she had a nice potential for customers.  Later, she located it in her own home and now has it in a store front that is working well.  She added on lunches, phone orders, internet orders, photocopying etc.  Yolanda's work day starts at 6:00am and ends at 2:00pm.  She makes her largest sales on the weekends.  Her customers are students, employees and neighbors from her neighborhood who know the quality that Yolanda provides.  Her goal is to make improvements to the physical condition of her kitchen and add an industrial stove to increase her productivity.

When she lost her husband in a workplace accident, she began to work to make money. She struggled to make ends meet, and felt like she had to do something. When she saw that women were sellers at stands by the seaside, she believed that she could do it as well and decided to sell readymade jewelry and accessories. She received permission from the municipality to open a stand by the coast and began to sell jewelry. In the summer, the coast is bustling, and the stands can do business until 3 in the morning. Semiha has earned a living for the past seven years in this way. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will travel to another city and buy a variety of jewelry. She believes that if she has a large variety of jewelry, then her sales, and thus her income, will increase. As long as she is healthy, she plans to continue working and operate her stand every summer. Her stand gives her life.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\r\nSemiha Han\u0131m e\u015fini bir i\u015f kazas\u0131nda kaybedince  ekonomik sebelerden i\u015fe ba\u015fl\u0131yor.
