She and her husband have to work hard, but are determined to have a better income for their family.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Agripina would like to apply for a loan to purchase more grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. With the amount of 22,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages.\r\n\r\nShe sincerely sends you her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Agripina dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her family will always be in good health. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

As a Babban Gona member, Dauda, is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Dauda can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare,  double the National average of 14. However, Dauda is ambitious and is aiming to reap above both he national and Babban Gona averages this season.

Meet David, an ambitious, hardworking and go-getting man who is 46 years of age. David is the proud father of seven children, who he really loves and cherishes a lot. He has been working as a farmer for the past nine years. \r\n\r\nDavid hails from the Litein area of Kenya, an area that has wonderful weather patterns favoring crop and animal farming. Through farming he has gained great experience, and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. This gives him an advantage compared to other farmers who are still very new in farming. Through mixed farming David has been able to provide for his family and pay tuition fees for his seven children, although he has been facing challenges because of inadequate funds.\r\n\r\nDavid is very passionate about dairy farming, and has even given his cow a nickname \u201cTeta\u201d. He really enjoys taking care of the cows, and also he enjoys selling milk a lot. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, David lacks a proper dairy building where he can comfortably milk his cows and where his cows can rest. This is why he is seeking a loan of 35,000 Kenya Shillings to build a dairy building. Through the revenues from the dairy building, David is sure he can take care of his family and provide a secure future for his children, because his milk production levels will have gone up. A proper dairy building means that his cows will have a good place to rest and will not be affected with bad weather conditions, hence he will incur fewer expenses having to treat the cows. This money saved will be used to provide a secure future for his family.\r\n\r\nDavid is very enterprising, and through accumulated profits he wants to start a larger dairy business where he will be selling milk to wholesalers, retailers and also selling milk products such as cream and butter, yoghurt and milk powder.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1654948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

From some parts of the road, you can see the mountain range and the highest volcano in Mexico, called the Pico de Orizaba.  \r\n\r\nIn this area, the credit group \"Grupo Leo\" was recently formed.  The members are:\r\n\r\nBeatriz, who sells chickens; Leovigilda, who sells sewing supplies; Guadalupe, who sells candy; Josefina, who sells food; Teresa, who sells food; Florentina, who sells cheese; Maria, who sells footwear from catalogues; and Bonifacio, who sells bananas.\r\n\r\nBonifacio has been selling fried bananas for 23 years.  When he started, he prepared them at home and then sold them on the streets.  Nowadays he takes a cart out with him (one that is similar to hot dog carts) on the streets in the local areas and he prepares the food on the spot. The cart already has a cooker, so it is just a case of putting the bananas on the grill. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, it was difficult, but \"Don Boni\", as he is known, made some adjustments to his cart so it is now easier to push through the streets. As time has gone by, he has visited many places where he has sold his products. \r\n\r\nWith the income he generates and with the loan, he will buy supplies (bananas, cream, cheese). He gets his firewood himself and looks after his cart on his own. He is grateful to \"VisionFund\" for being able to continue to prosper in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":1646145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bananas, milk, cream and cheese.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-07-29T11:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-28T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":3025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leovigilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yadira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifacio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":378.13,"local_amount":4875,"processed_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-08-17T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4905.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":517705257},{"amount":756.26,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":9810.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530255698},{"amount":1134.38,"local_amount":14625,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:42:20Z","rounded_local_amount":14716.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690513},{"amount":756.23,"local_amount":9750,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":9810.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561823494}],"funded_date":"2014-07-29T15:34:46Z","paid_date":"2014-11-17T16:01:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":743624,"name":"Nh\u00f3m 01 Th\u00f4n 2 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u1ea3i Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Tuy\u1ebfn works in agriculture, raising poultry.

He picked his profession as the only means he saw of providing for his family. He works close to his house. His wife helps with the farm and has been doing so since the beginning. He asks for a loan to buy two calves. His plan is to use discards from the crops (broad beans and sweetcorn) to feed the calves and put them to work. He dreams of continuing to support his family and improving their standard of living. He hopes, for the sake of his family, that his hard work and his efforts will pay off.

She will use her loan to buy the ingredients and supplies she needs: tortilla, chili peppers, skewers, napkins, meat, gas, cream, cheese, paper, tomatoes, and other items.

They work with the micro-finance organization Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. They are on their sixth loan with the organization. Sitan, the person standing at the left the photo, grows crops of groundnuts and rice.

Like all Babban Gona members, Hassan can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Hassan is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to acces quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 35 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Hassan is hopeful about what the future holds; he  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, he will finally be able to afford to educate his children; Friday,  and  Yakubu.

It is comprised of eight members, with Nieves as president. The members have several businesses such as recycling, call shop, milk sales, transportation services, mobile phone accessories sales, ironmonger, food sales. The loan will thus benefit small entrepreneurs, among them Nieves. The latter says that she joined Pro Mujer one year ago, invited by a spokesperson for the institution who came to her house. She owns a scrap metal recycling shop, which she started years ago upon noticing that many items made of metal that end up discarded can be collected and sold on. She asks for a loan to increase her working capital by buying scrap metal from the people who collect it in the city of El Alto. She will then sell it to companies. Nieves derives from this business an income that enables her to support her family, since she is married and has six children. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she mentions health services provided by the institution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5150,"image":{"id":1654499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy scrap metal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-07-29T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-28T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":5150,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena Silveria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Ninoska\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marco Antonio\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":35576,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":5150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5540.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5721.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5847.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6006.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6169.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6290.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":802.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":846.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":869.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":893.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":910.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":802.04,"local_amount":5540.48,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5541.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030166},{"amount":828.19,"local_amount":5721.14,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5722.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522385},{"amount":1716.04,"local_amount":11854.32,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":11857.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561656025},{"amount":893.04,"local_amount":6169.08,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6170.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579575011},{"amount":910.69,"local_amount":6290.98,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6292.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168850}],"funded_date":"2014-08-01T04:40:31Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:03:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":743667,"name":"Natia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natia is 31 years old.

She says that she joined Pro Mujer for the first time when a promoter of the institute came to visit her at her house. Today she has a business selling dairy products. She says she started the business several years ago. She learned how to make the products from her parents and when she got married she decided to start her business as a source of economic resources. <br \/><br \/>The loan that she is getting now is for food in the dry season (buying wholesale fodder) that she will purchase at the sellers in her community and later give to her cattle for food. Working in this way allows her to provide resources to support her family as she is married and has five children. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer she replied that she likes the life insurance that the institute

Now, she is 58 years old and has her own workshop with one employee. She derives from her business income enough to help her husband with household expenses.

Nuruila has a secondary education and, to provide the primary source of income for her family, is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business in 2007 with a 10,000 som (KGS) purchase of livestock. Thanks to Nuruila's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 4 mares and 30 sheep, and also 2.25 hectares of land, where she grows barley and hay. In order to further develop her business, Nuruila requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy sheep for subsequent fattening up and resale. Nuruila plans to invest the earnings from her business into further increasing the domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a house for her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1656058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Muhabbat lives in the city of Khujand in the J.Rasulo district. She is a polite, respectful and skilled salesperson. She is 53 years old. Her family consists of six people. All of her children are grown and independent.\r\n\r\nMuhabbat opened a food market in her district in 2005 with her own working capital, and her store has been in business for 9 years now. She obtained regular customers over these years. Her husband and children help Muhabbat to run the business. Because a big holiday of the Holy Month of Ramadan is approaching, people are buying more products to provide a big spread. Due to this, Muhabbat wants to expand her selection and increase the inventory of products in her store. This is how she would be able to increase the family's budget, and this is why this loan is very important to her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1656596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He is a very well known and respected member of his community because of his education and willingness to serve others. He has high moral and spiritual standards. He grew up with his parents and grandparents, who were the ones to correct him and guide him down the right path. The good values that he learned at home are what have helped him get ahead today and become a good and successful person.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 got his basic education in the local school. He would study every day in the evening, since in the mornings he would help his father and grandfather with their farm work, which was their main source of financial income and helped provide for the family and cover the basic needs of their household. In time Jos\u00e9 acquired knowledge and experience in growing basic grains and that is how he started working on his own. When he met his wife, they decided to start a family and a life together and today they have three children, who are going to the local school.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 works farming and raising livestock, which he learned from his father and grandfather. He has 25 years of experience because he has been working ever since he was a child when he would go out to the fields in the mornings alongside his father with sickle, a watering can, and a pair of sandals, which made up his working gear.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money to buy wood and shingles to repair the roof of his house. This will allow him to give his children and his whole family more protection, since it is a basic right in life to have decent housing, a place to be protected from the cold, the heat, the rain, and the sun.\r\n\r\nThe goals he has set for his future are to finish his house and have it ready with everything his family needs in order to rest and be protected. He also wants to help his children become professionals as much as he can, since he says one of them wants to become a computer science engineer. He will achieve all of this by investing his earnings wisely and investing a new loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1653578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood and shingles to repair the roof of his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-07-29T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-28T16:30:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":356.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":368.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":381.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":393.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":381.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":393.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":361.02,"local_amount":361.02,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":361.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530009462},{"amount":365.71,"local_amount":365.71,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":365.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501485},{"amount":386.68,"local_amount":386.68,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":386.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420287},{"amount":386.59,"local_amount":386.59,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":386.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545034}],"funded_date":"2014-07-29T18:49:23Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:34:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":743696,"name":"Progressive Farmers Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a member of the Progressive Farmers.

He plans to procure a processing plant for the farmers in his association so that their value-added crops can be sold to the local companies for a higher price.  \r\n\r\nIt is clear that John is enterprising and hardworking. However, he still finds farming challenging because of the high financial costs of maintenance. In particular, he has to hire many labourers to weed, prune and harvest the crops. He also has to purchase important agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and insect traps. Without such inputs, the crops are susceptible to being attacked by fruit flies and will not grow well. A loan will allow him to purchase these essential inputs and help increase his yield significantly, and his profits would far exceed the capital he needs to invest in his farms now. The loan will also help pay the school fees for his youngest child.

Rael has been doing farming for the past 6 years and through farming she has managed to provide for her family. Litein area of Kenya is where Rael hails from and this place is very fertile with good climatic conditions that favor crop and animal farming.\n\nLitein area is one of the places that was blessed with good soils, climate and rainfall patterns and all these factors are very rare to find in one place, which is why Rael, being an enterprising person, decided to start planting tomatoes and vegetables. That is why she is seeking a loan of KES 45,000 to start planting tomatoes and vegetables). Rael has a keen eye and has noticed that all the factors in this area favor tomatoes and vegetable farming, that is good climate, roads, markets and the immense knowledge that she has on farming, and all these combined will give him an advantage when she starts farming.\n\nBecause of available markets Rael will reap more profits and also proximity to the road will ensure products are always fresh hence fetching a high price in the market.

Meet Judith, 32 years of age, very hardworking, honest and humble. She hails from the Litein area of Kenya, an area that has good weather patterns and one of the best places to buy land so that you can start farming both small scale and large scale. Judith is a mother of three adorable kids that always make her day bright when she sees them, or as she often refers to them, \u201cher stars.\u201d Because of lack of proper employment, Judith ventured into farming six years ago, and she has never regretted it because of the profits that she has been making. Through profits from dairy farming, crop farming and personal business, Judith has been able to earn a decent income and always put a plate of food on the table for her family. Although she has been making profits, Judith still faces challenges in comfortably supporting her family and has a plan to start a horticulture business. The Litein area has some of the best conditions that favor horticulture farming: a good market, soil, climate and good transport system in her area. Because of the above reasons, she is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 to start horticulture farming. Through good soil and climate, she will be able to sell fruits, vegetables and potatoes to the nearby markets, and this means increased profit levels. Transporting the products to the market will never be a hurdle because of the good transport system, and hence products will always reach the market while they are still fresh, hence more income.\r\nJudith's plan is to be able to increase the market for her horticulture business and not only sell in the local market but also sell internationally. Through increased markets, she will be able to provide a secure future for her children and a good education for them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1655936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Hoshim is a resident of a rural village. He has a lot of work experience in the field of livestock breeding. From childhood, Hoshim has helped his father raise, graze and sell cattle. When Hoshim was a child, his father gave him several lambs so that Hoshim felt a sense of responsibility for his livestock. Now raising and fattening up cattle are Hoshim's primary source of income. Since he lives in the countryside, he works seasonally as a hired field hand. Hoshim's wife also works seasonally in the fields and helps her husband look after the cattle in her spare time. Hoshim buys and fattens up cattle and then resells them at a higher price. With the earned funds, he buys cattle again and fattens them up for future sale. As it is currently not the season to work in the fields, Hoshim has come into some financial troubles, which is why he turned to MDO \"Arvand,\" LLC. With the received loan, Hoshim plans to buy feed and cattle while they are still cheap.

Since childhood Zarifa has learned to raise livestock from her parents. Six years ago she started her own independent livestock business. She uses her backyard to raise both cattle and sheep. This work brings her both good profits and a lot of enjoyment. Currently Zarifa has a few sheep and a calf, so she wants to expand her herd. As she has insufficient personal savings, Zarifa has turned to us for a loan which she will use to buy another calf and a few more sheep.

","en":"Sanavbar is a hard working woman. She was born in 1980 and is a responsible mother of three kids. She is always trying to make sure her children will receive a good education. Five years ago Sanavbar started selling perfume at the local market. Her husband works as a security guard at the local market. His salary is small and so Sanavbar was forced to start supporting her family with her business. Due to her hard work she now has regular clients. Currently, Sanavbar is requesting a loan of 10,000 somoni to purchase perfume and so expand her business and increase her working capital. She awaits your

Ana owns a vegetable business, and the vegetables she grows and sells are corn, peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers. She learned it through training that she received from a government institution. Previously she was helping her husband produce staple foods. The farming is done in the same community, so they only take ten minutes to get to the land.

is 44 years old, and went to school as far as the second grade. He is the first of seven siblings, and because his family grew very quickly he had to leave school in order to work.  He lives with his spouse, who is a stay-at-home parent.  They have a daughter who is not yet in school, so they are a family of three with another one on the way.  Rene has worked in agriculture since he was ten years old, having learned this work from his father.  At that time, it was the only means available to him to be able to feed himself in the future.  He now has to work alone in the field, and has no other source of income.  The place where he works is in the same community, 20 minutes from his house.  He works for five hours every day. The loan that he is requesting through CREDICAMPO is to  buy six bags of manure for the second fertilization of 14,000 square meters of corn.  He will buy the manure in the city, which is 12 kilometers from his community, on a Sunday, because this is the only day of the week that there is transportation available.

He lives with his spouse, who is a stay-at-home parent.  They have five children; only three live with them, and the others work for a soft drink company.  Only his spouse and his three children are dependent on him, and they own their own house.  Eleuterio works in agriculture, which he learned from his father.  He grows 14,000 square meters of corn, and 7,000 of beans.  His family's income depends on his harvest.  Eleuterio also fishes, but only for personal consumption.  There is a lagoon near the place where he lives, which allows him to provide food for his family.  The place where he grows his crops is a 25-minute walk away.  His two children who work also help provide some income for the family.  The loan that he is requesting through CREDICAMPO is to pay the rent on the land that he cultivates, to pay people to help him clear the land where he will plant, and also to buy herbicides and fertilizers that are necessary in order for him to have a good harvest.  His main dream is that God will allow him to have a good harvest of both corn and beans, so that he can fulfill his commitments, ensure his family's food security, and have the income necessary to get ahead.  It is very important to him and his spouse that they provide their children with the education that they need to have a better quality of life.

It is made up of eight members and is run by an executive committee, of which Concepcion is the president. The businesses that the members of the communal bank run vary, among them kerosene sales, fruit sales, food sales, a neighborhood store, a soft drink store, fried potato with hot dog sales, fish sales, and woven textile sales. The loan that they will take out will benefit small business owners, one of whom is Concepcion. She says that this is her fifth year as a member of Pro Mujer, which she joined at the invitation of a consultant of the institution who went to visit her. Currently she has a workshop where textiles are woven. She shares that she learned this business from her mother, who had this business, and she supported her in her sales. The loan that she will take out now is to increase capital (purchase thread wholesale from the wholesale venders in the city of El Alto) and after production she will sell it to her clients made-to-order. This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her family, since she is single and has two children. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the savings that the institution offers.

Her husband works as an industrial mechanic.  They do not have their own home, therefore they live in her parents' home.  Digna works four days a week plucking chickens.  This job provides her with financial solvency.  She also raises hens and guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used to pay the fee on a plot of land she acquired.  Her goal is to have more animals and her own home.

five children each. Most of them live in traditional families in Zoumayere, a commune located in the Sikasso Cercle (third administrative region of Mali). They work with Kiva's partner, the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, in order to successfully carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. They are on their eleventh farming loan with the institution and have duly repaid all their previous loans.\r\n\r\nSali, a member of the group, grows groundnut. In the photo, she is the woman in the middle of the standing row.  She is planning to use her loan to buy three 50-kilo bags of fertilizers, three cans of herbicide, and also to cover the cost of plowing on 0.75 hectare of land.
