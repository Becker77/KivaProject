nine women and located in the rural area of San Andres Semetabaj, Guatemala. The ladies meet once each month with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer to manage their loans and to participate in educational trainings. As many of them have had little or no education, they are pleased to have an opportunity to speak openly about issues like violence against women, discrimination, women\u2019s rights as well as women\u2019s health. During the trainings, the women can give their point of view or simply share their experiences. This helps them to improve their self-esteem. \r\n\r\nMaria is the President of the Trust Bank with eight children who range in age from 6 to 22. She is married to a bricklayer. Maria is a hard working woman and has a handicraft and textile business. She has regular clients and delivers products to them once each month. This allows her to have a regular, fixed income. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase additional raw materials including thread in bulk. She will be able to reduce her costs by taking advantage of offers and discounts.\r\n\r\nMaria had no access to formal education but she understands the importance that education has in her life and for her own children. She is more prepared to successfully manage her loan and her business with the information that she receives at her Trust Bank meetings. Besides the topics mentioned above, Maria and her friends in the Trust Bank learn about effective business practices including accounting, budgeting, business planning, customer service, marketing and pricing. She supports and encourages her children to pursue their own studies because she realizes that education is a vital key to a successful future. One of her eight children will graduate from high school next year and Maria is quite thrilled about this!\r\n\r\nKiva investors play a key role in the lives of the nine women in the Trust Bank in funding their small loans. They face a more prosperous and brighter future as more aware and empowered women, committed to eliminating poverty in their lives. Thank you, Kiva investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1655387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

shores of Lake Atitlan in Guatemala. Those who live there are Maya-Kakchikel and proudly practice their cultural and linguistic traditions. The women wear particularly beautiful \u201ctraje\u201d or traditional costume, in shades of blues and greens. \r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cArtesanas Santa Catarina\u201d meaning \u201cArtisans from Santa Catarina\u201d was formed here and consists of seven dedicated and hardworking women. They share the common goal of creating more successful and prosperous lives for themselves and their families. Petrona is one of them and she is a shining example of a woman who has worked very hard and made a success of herself. She is 43-years-old and has seven children. Two of her children, who were in school, have already graduated. Petrona makes high end textiles and sells them in tourist markets throughout Guatemala. Because of the excellent quality of her work, her products enjoy high demand. Petrona is requesting a loan that she will use to increase her inventory. From other vendors, she wants to purchase bags and purses of various sizes, scarves, shawls, belts, typical blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d as well as supplies for her own textile business including thread. Petrona employs seven women in the community of Santa Catarina who are motivated, skilled and have a good work ethic. The ladies are most pleased to have employment.\r\n\r\n\u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is the name that Friendship Bridge gives to the combination of small loans and participatory education. Each month, a Loan Officer from the organization shares timely information with Petrona and the ladies in the Trust Bank about relevant topics like women\u2019s rights, violence against women and self-esteem, effective business management practices as well as hygiene, health and nutrition. \r\n\r\nPetrona and each of the women in the Trust Bank appreciate the support of Kiva investors. They are determined to use their loans wisely, to empower themselves and eliminate poverty. Being able to access capital is so very important to them. Thank you, Kiva investors!

Most of them live in traditional families in N'goloniena, a village located in the commune of Lobougoula, Cercle of Sikasso (third administrative region of Mali). They work with Kiva's partner, the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, in order to successfully carry out their farming activities during the rainy season. They are on their seventh farming loan with the institution and have duly repaid their previous loans.\r\n\r\nMariam, a member of the group, grows groundnut. In the photo, she is in the back row, second from the left. She is planning to use her loan to buy one 50-kilo bag of fertilizers, one can of herbicide, and also to cover the cost of plowing to maintain 0.5 hectare of land. After the harvest, she sells her crop in her village and in Sikasso. She sells to both men and women and gets paid in cash and on credit. Mariam is expecting to make an average profit of 73,000 CFA francs per planting season. She will use her profit to repay her loan and the interest, and also to help her husband with the day-to-day expenses.

Gambo joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his  children: Anas, Yusufa, and  Harisu. Gambo is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. For the first time, Gambo will have access to quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed. Without this loan, he would be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive but are often diluted with external products such as sand.

Jafaru expressed that he is driven by one goal; to \u201cbecome the most profitable farmer in my community.\u201d It is the desire to fulfil this ambition that led Jafaru to join Babban Gona. Now, as a Babban Gona member, he finally has the opportunity to access credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Jafaru can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. With access to high-quality inputs, Jafaru could yield up to 30 bags of maize\/hectare, double the national average of 14. By doing so, Jafaru will finally have enough money to make significant life changes.

They are on their 5th group loan with the organization, with their previous loans having been fully repaid. \r\n\r\nDiakalia, pictured as the first man standing from left to right in the photo, is a member of the Sinignessigui 1 group who is in the business of cultivating corn. With his loan, Diakalia plans to purchase 14 bags of 50kg of fertilizer, 20 barrels of herbicide of various types, and to pay the labor costs to maintain 3.5 hectares.\r\n\r\nAfter his harvest, Diakalia sells his crops in the villages of Sikasso to a customer base made up of both men and women, for both cash and credit. He hopes to earn an average income of 520,000 francs CFA per crop. This income will allow Diakalia to pay back the loan and interest as well as to contribute to the daily expenses for his family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1649534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fertilizer and pay labor costs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Niaradougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-07-30T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-29T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":5475,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diakalia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seydou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karim ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diakalia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdoul Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amadou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":2640000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2640000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Long Phillips","image":1429530}},{"id":744156,"name":"Sitha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sitha is 25 years old and a student at a university.

Due to her family's economic situation she couldn't continue her studies. She is married and her husband works as a security guard for the Municipal government. She has two children, the first is 9 years old and is in Grade 3. The second is only 3 years old and doesn't study yet. Just her and her husband and children live together.\r\n  \r\nAt the moment Teresa does not have an activity that generates income, she just takes care of her daughters. Her revenue depends on the help of her husband. She has no activity because about 3 months ago she got sick that stopped her from running her small business. She sold vegetables. Her husband helped her to transport the vegetables from the city. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from CrediCampo is to cancel a debt that she has. When she was sick she had to find someone to lend her the money for the expense of the medicine. She is also going to buy vegetables to re-open her business as it is something that is profitable. With the loan she will be able to have her business by buying what is necessary and thus she will have revenues to pay for the family expenses along with her husband. \r\n\r\nTeresa's dream is to prepare her children academically. Before she used to say that it seemed very far away to having an adequate home like the one they have today, but thanks to the efforts of her husband they have succeeded. So they can continue to progress hoping to provide the best for their daughters so they can get ahead and help others that need it and contribute to having a better country.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1653428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

She also has a butchery, in addition to the drug shop business, and she says this helps her a lot since it gives her additional income which she uses to cater to the needs of the family. Her clients are people around Ishaka who go to her to buy drugs for their sick relatives. \r\n\r\nAnnah's main challenge is competition since there are several drug shops in the same area where she operates from, but she believes that if she is given a loan of UGX 5,000,000, she will restock the drug shop and will out-compete her competitors. \r\n\r\nHer future hope includes establishing other drug shop outlets, so that she makes more sales and earns more profits.

As a Babban Gona member, Kabiru, is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Kabiru can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare,  double the National average of 14. However, Kabiru is ambitious and is aiming to reap 40 bags per hectare this season.

Dandila joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his  children: Isiya,Thomas, and Musa. Dandila is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty.

A pesar de las dificultades econ\u00f3micas que tuvieron, Andrea consigui\u00f3 estudiar Ingenier\u00eda Qu\u00edmica en la Universidad del Atl\u00e1ntico, donde estuvo becada todos los semestres y logr\u00f3 obtener el t\u00edtulo profesional en Noviembre del 2012. \nAndrea tiene como principal objetivo realizar una maestr\u00eda en Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental y Producci\u00f3n de Alimentos Agr\u00edcolas en la Universidad de Hohenheim en Alemania, y para lograrlo necesita solicitar el apoyo de Kiva, puesto que es la \u00fanica forma para poder cubrir los gastos de ex\u00e1menes de idioma y aplicaci\u00f3n a las universidades. Una vez realice su maestr\u00eda y regrese a Colombia, Andrea anhela trabajar en fundaciones u organizaciones sociales que lleven a cabo proyectos que incluyan la recuperaci\u00f3n de suelos, agricultura ecol\u00f3gica y seguridad alimentaria, y que al mismo tiempo contribuya con la auto-sostenibilidad de su regi\u00f3n.\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia: \nDesde siempre, mi familia me ha dado su apoyo incondicional en todos los proyectos que he llevado a cabo. Aunque planeo embarcarme una aventura de aprendizaje extraordinaria, mi madre y mi hermana no cuentan con el apoyo financiero necesario para hacer este sue\u00f1o realidad.\nFormular fungicidas fue durante dos a\u00f1os una parte importante de mi vida profesional como ingeniera qu\u00edmica. Pero lleg\u00f3 un momento en que me di cuenta que as\u00ed no me ve\u00eda durante los a\u00f1os que le esperan a mi carrera. Lo que sol\u00eda formular en dichas plantas qu\u00edmicas, en definitiva, no es una soluci\u00f3n sostenible en la pr\u00e1ctica de la agricultura en t\u00e9rminos tanto de su rendimiento, as\u00ed como de la protecci\u00f3n ambiental. Es por eso que decid\u00ed dejar esa industria y enfocar tanto mi carrera como mi vida a la protecci\u00f3n ambiental y a la agricultura ecol\u00f3gica. \nComenc\u00e9 a tocar puertas a distintas organizaciones ambientales, pero he recibido respuestas negativas por distintas razones. Sin embargo, eso no me ha detenido en la lucha de mi sue\u00f1o. As\u00ed que actualmente me encuentro haciendo un diplomado en la Universidad Nacional sobre Agricultura ecol\u00f3gica y Biolog\u00eda de suelos y al mismo tiempo, soy parte de un grupo de voluntariado en Agricultura Urbana, que se centra en ayudar a poblaciones vulnerables en las \u00e1reas circundantes a Bogot\u00e1.\nCon las visitas de campo que he tenido la fortuna de realizar hasta el momento, he podido interactuar de primera mano con los campesinos en la Sabana de Bogot\u00e1; lo cual me ha llevado a poder asimilar lo dispendioso que puede llegar a ser, en cuanto a tiempo, recursos y dinero, el llevar a cabo pr\u00e1cticas ecol\u00f3gicas en el campo, teniendo en cuenta que mucha de esta tierra ha sufrido muchos a\u00f1os de agricultura convencional y por lo tanto, tiene niveles de degradaci\u00f3n altos. \nPor estar razones he decidido estudiar en el exterior una Maestr\u00eda en Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental y Producci\u00f3n de alimentos agr\u00edcolas. Al cursarla quiero poder desarrollar, a\u00fan m\u00e1s, mi potencial en un ambiente educativo de primer mundo, de la mano de expertos en las pr\u00e1cticas ecol\u00f3gicas y sostenibles en la agricultura. Adem\u00e1s de poder absorber experiencias de colegas de todos los \u00e1mbitos y culturas para que el proceso de aprendizaje involucre una sinergia que faculte soluciones interdisciplinarias f\u00e1cilmente adaptables a nuestro medio colombiano. \nSolicito el apoyo por parte de KIVA para completar los requisitos de idioma y de papeleo para la inscripci\u00f3n de la Maestr\u00eda mencionada con antelaci\u00f3n, debido a que muy a pesar de no contar con todos los recursos monetarios en el momento para llevarlo a cabo, poseo la pasi\u00f3n y la suficiente motivaci\u00f3n para creer en este sue\u00f1o que llevo construyendo, porque no s\u00f3lo se trata de m\u00ed, como persona, sino de cada uno de los campesinos que se trabajan Sol a Sol sin descanso para labrar la tierra y poder cultivar el alimento no s\u00f3lo para ellos y los miembros de su familia sino para todos los que nos alimentamos de la tierra indirectamente.","en":"Andrea is 23 years old and was born in Barranquilla, Atlantico, a town located in the north of Colombia. She is the youngest daughter in her family. Her older sister is an Electronics Engineer and her mother is a homemaker. Despite the economic difficulties they had, Andrea managed to study Chemical Engineering at the Univeristy of Atlantico, where she received a scholarship every semester and managed to obtain a professional qualification in November of 2012. \r\n\r\nAndrea's main objective is to pursue a Masters degree in Environmental Protection and Agricultural Food Production at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. In order to do so, she needs to request Kiva's help, given that it is the only way she will be able to cover the expenses of the language exams and university application.  Once she has completed her Masters and returned to Colombia, Andrea hopes to work for foundations or social organizations that carry out projects which include soil recovery, ecological agriculture and food security, and that at the same time contribute to the self-sustainability of her region.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\n\"My family has always given me their unconditional support in all of the projects that I have accomplished. Although I plan to embark on an adventure of extraordinary learning, my mother and my sister do not have the financial support necessary to make this dream a reality. For two years, creating fungicides was an important part of my professional life as a chemical engineer. But at a certain point I realized that this was not how I envisioned myself in the years of my career that awaited me. What I used to create in those chemical plants, in the end, is not a sustainable solution in agricultural practice, both in terms of performance as well as environmental protection. That is why I decided to leave that industry and focus my career, like my life, on environmental protection and ecological agriculture.\r\n\r\nI began to knock on the doors of various environmental organizations, but I received negative responses for different reasons. However, that did not hold me back in the fight to achieve my dream. And so, I am currently studying for a diploma from the National University in Ecological Agriculture and Soil Biology. At the same time, I am part of a volunteer group in Urban Agriculture, which focusses on helping vulnerable people in the areas surrounding Bogota.\r\n\r\nWith the field visits I have had the fortune to experience up to this moment, I have been able to interact firsthand with the rural workers in the Savanna of Bogota. That interaction has allowed me to absorb how arduous it can become, in terms of time, resources and money, to carry out ecological practices in the countryside, keeping in mind that much of this land has suffered many years of conventional agriculture and as a result has high levels of degradation.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I decided to study abroad for a Masters in Environmental Protection and Agricultural Food Production. By enrolling in this program, I hope to develop, even further, my potential, in a first world educational environment, at the hands of experts in ecological and sustainable agricultural practices. I will also be able to absorb the experiences of colleagues from all cultures and settings so that the learning process will involve a synergy that foments interdisciplinary solutions easily adaptable to our Colombian environment.\r\n\r\nI am requesting Kiva's support in order to complete the language and paperwork requirements to register for the aforementioned Masters, given that very much despite lacking the monetary resources at the moment to carry it out, I have the passion and sufficient motivation to believe in this dream that I am building. This is because it is not only about myself, as a person, but rather about each of the farmers that work from sun up to sun down without rest to work the land in order to be able to cultivate the food, not only for themselves and the members of their families, but for all of us who nourish ourselves indirectly from the land.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1655439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for the application process to the University of Hohenheim in Germany.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogota D.C.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2014-07-30T19:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-29T19:00:45Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650529947}],"funded_date":"2014-07-31T01:31:40Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Terri Whitehead","image":1608787}},{"id":744282,"name":"Lucita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucita works hard to support her family.

He works on a farm in the sector. He requests a loan to invest in a business he is starting, pig farming. He learned this work from childhood from his parents and also from farms where he has worked. He comes from a humble family with limited economic resources. What impedes him from readying himself is that he only has a primary school education. Today, he fights very hard so that his children have a better future than he did. With this investment, they will improve their quality of life and move forward.

Rosmery.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago after receiving an invitation from a friend who is a client of the organization.  Rosmery currently has a sewing business in which she produces quilts.  She has become knowledgeable about this business since she started 12 years ago.  Rosmery launched her business with the first loan she obtained from Pro Mujer.  She also mentions that she learned how to manufacture these products by observing how they were made.  \n\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying fabric and fibers in bulk.  She acquires her supplies from the wholesale vendors in the city of Alto and then uses them to make the products she sells based on the orders from her customers.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income to support her family.  Rosmery is single and has three children.  \n\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Rosmery said that she enjoys the training seminars and the health services offered by the organization."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1648274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and fibers in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-07-30T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-29T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly Del Rosario\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janneth Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yandira Sorayda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26076,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4161.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4173.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4287.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4404.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4523.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4526.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":602.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":604.21},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":620.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":654.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":655.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1206.61,"local_amount":8334.72,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8337.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030137},{"amount":620.7,"local_amount":4287.56,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4288.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522356},{"amount":637.57,"local_amount":4404.04,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4405.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561655996},{"amount":654.8,"local_amount":4523.04,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4524.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579574983},{"amount":655.32,"local_amount":4526.64,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4528.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168826}],"funded_date":"2014-08-17T18:42:10Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:03:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":740537,"name":"Cha\u00f1ucagua Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cCHA\u00d1UCAGUA\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Patacamaya, est\u00e1 compuesta por diez  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Cristina es la Presidenta.

When asked, Emmanuel said \u201cI plan to use the money I make to educate my children; Obadiya, Rejoice, and Kefas, and in 5 years, I want to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\" With this loan, he is well on his way to achieving this dream.

Cesar is one of these successful entrepreneurs.  At the age of 45, he has had to work hard to get to the point where he is today.  He has been working as a farmer for eight years, despite having only a sixth grade education.  When the time came, Cesar traded in a serving tray for a plow since he occasionally worked as a waiter at a restaurant.  His main inspiration comes from his wife and their two children, ages 19 and 6.  Both of his children are studying hard so that they can finish their education.  \n\nDon Cesar started down the path as a farmer by planting a little bit of corn with some money he had saved.  Later he decided to begin selling corn on the cob.  As the years passed, he continued to save until he was able to buy a cow which gradually turned into several.  The support of his wife has been essential to Cesar.  Together they have been able to get ahead by selling corn on the cob, sewing, and preparing \u201cg\u00fcirilas\u201d (white corn tortillas filled with crumbled cheese).  However, Cesar\u2019s dreams don\u2019t stop there.  He wants to keep increasing his herd of cows and his harvest.  For this reason, he needs a loan in order to buy compost and pay the workers who will be harvesting the new crop of corn.

His father abandoned them when he was only 2 years old and never took care of them. Nonetheless, his mother has managed to support them with great sacrifice and effort.

Meet Regina, a hardworking mother who is 28 years of age and full of energy. She hails from the Litein area of Kenya, an area that is blessed with good weather patterns and a good place to buy land so that one can start farming activities.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has been blessed with six lovely children that she really loves. Regina is a very hardworking woman and she always says, \u201cMy parents taught me to work hard from a young age and now I am independent.\u201d Through hard work she has been able to practice mixed farming, growing crops and practicing dairy farming, which has helped her to always put food on the table for her children and family. \r\n\r\nThe Litein area of Kenya has a ready market for milk but the supply is low. This is because the population is high and the supply can\u2019t cater to everybody. That is why Regina has always wanted to keep more dairy cows because she is assured that she will reap more profits. Because of the above valid reasons, she is kindly requesting a loan of KES 57,200 to buy a dairy cow and through the loan she will be sure that her business will flourish and she will get more income.\r\n\r\nBecause of having a large family, Regina requires more capital to feed them and hence this loan will assist her in feeding the six stomachs that always depend on her.\r\n\r\nBeing a visionary mother, Regina plans to open a business of selling milk and she is sure that, through the profits earned, her children will never lack and her life will be stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1655921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She never regrets starting farming because through the profits that she has been making, she has taken care of her family and paid tuition fees for her four children. Jane\u2019s farm is located along the river, where she grows vegetables and maize. The main challenge she has been facing is watering the farm using water from the rive. \r\n\r\nThis is why she is kindly seeking a loan of 40,000 KES to buy a water pump. With the water pump she will be able to irrigate her farm and therefore increase her vegetable production; hence, this will increase profits because there will be a bumper harvest in her farm. Vegetable farming requires a lot of water and this water pump will be of so much help because water will be pumped directly from the river to the farm, assuring Jane of a bumper harvest. This water will also be used for home consumption and will improved Jane's living conditions.\r\n\r\nJane's vision is to be able to open a large vegetable-selling business where she will reap more

Most of Fatima's customers are neighbors, relatives and friends.\r\n\r\nFatima is a hard-working woman who sacrifices her life for the sake of her children. Fatima has been an Al Majmoua borrower for 10 loans, and almost all of her loans were used to pay for treatment of her child's illness. \r\nHer previously Kiva-funded loan was invested in buying a new tailoring machine, which developed her business properly.\r\n\r\nFatima is applying for a loan this time to improve her business by refurbishing two tailoring machines she has for better production. These two machines are very important for her business development and to increase her income.\r\nShe hopes to stay healthy and capable of covering almost all of her family's needs.

","en":"Zuura is 38 years old, a widow and has 2 sons and 2 daughters. Despite the fact that Zuura was left alone with the children, she did not despair and sit with her hands down. In search of a source of income for her family, she got involved in breeding livestock 10 years ago with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her back-breaking work and patient character, today she has a good business with 1 dairy cow and a calf. Zuura sells milk products to local residents. Fresh, delicious milk is in high demand, and this is why Zuura requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy two dairy cows. Today her average monthly profit amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). The profit from selling milk and dairy products would allow Zuura to develop her business and improve her family's

In search of a source of income for her family, she got involved in providing hair styling services at a beauty salon. She started the business with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her back-breaking work, Gulnura achieved a lot of success and earns a monthly profit of 40,000 som (KGS). Today Gulnura already has regular clients, but does not have enough tools and equipment. This is why Gulnura requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy hair dryers and other equipment for providing hair styling services. Gulnura plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her business; she dreams of opening her own beauty

Meet Bornes, a 21-year-old mother who is very determined to succeed. Bornes is married and has one child who is very lovely. Bornes hails from Nandi Hills, Kenya; an area that gets good rainfall and has favorable weather patterns for farming. Bornes is very hard working and has been farming for the past 3 years. From the profits she has earned she has provided for her family the basic needs in life.\r\n\r\nBornes is from a humble background and her upbringing was challenging. She does not want this to repeat itself, and that is why she is doing anything positive that she can to have a good life and a secure future for her child.\r\n\r\nBornes is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES to buy poultry and start poultry farming.

Gulnar has a college degree in education. She works as a secondary school teacher. In addition, since 2004, she and her husband sell mass consumptiongoods. They also earn an income from providing computer services. In her garage, Gulnar arranged everything for the local youngters, who like to come there to play computer games. Not everyone in their village owns a computer, which is why this business brings a good income to Gulnar. However, her main business is retail. She is now expanding her store and decided to offer a wider assortment of goods. This is why Gulnar has turned to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the maount of 120,000 KGS to buy consumer goods. At present, her monthly revenue is about 20,000 KGS and the sales volume is over 120,000 KGS. Gulnar plans to invest the revenues resulting from her loan  into a further expansion of her business, and eventually save up for her youngest son's education.a

For ten years, he's been in the business of selling jaspiado, a special tie-dyed yarn used for traditional textiles, which he learned from a neighbor at his location.\r\n\r\nThe heat doesn't disturb his dream of continuing to fund his jaspiado sales - but he does need one important thing to keep going: he needs this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1655475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"with cash flow for his business selling traditional yarns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-07-30T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-29T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.41,"local_amount":210.86,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":213.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529924621},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":208.5,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":210.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542417046},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":208.5,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":210.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561554824},{"amount":27.47,"local_amount":211.27,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":213.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579463768},{"amount":27.1,"local_amount":208.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":210.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070446},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":210.6,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":212.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612113434},{"amount":161.44,"local_amount":1241.77,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1255.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624776712}],"funded_date":"2014-08-07T15:57:59Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T09:25:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":744008,"name":"Reina Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reina de 27 a\u00f1os de edad es madre soltera, vive con su grupo familiar y sus 2 hijos de 9 y 7 a\u00f1os de edad.
