She lives with her sister and brother-in-law, who also have two children. Sadly, because of lack of economic resources and because she had to start working at a very young age, Nana was unable to study a professional career. She works hard on the family-owned agricultural land, growing vegetables that are sold to local retailers for a good price. The agricultural activity is the only source of income for this five-member family. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Nana decided to start dairy farming and seek credit among local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Her application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $2,200 for purchasing two milk cows.  After the cows are purchased, the family will start producing dairy products like cheese and yogurt for selling. They will also use the milk products for feeding the

dreams for herself and her family. She has three children (one son and two daughters), one of whom is a student in college. They live in the small village of Magurmari in the district of Jalpaiguri. She is illiterate and can only sign her name, but her husband studied until grade 9.\r\n\r\nPramila's husband, Debendranath, is engaged in agricultural activities. He mainly grows paddy. Pramila helps her husband in different jobs every day to keep their crops healthy, which is an arduous and difficult job that is worthwhile at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nPramila's family's income depends on this agribusiness. Her husband has many years of experience in this job, which he learned from his father. The land is his own, an inheritance from his parents. With the growing expenses of his family, he needs to expand his business by cultivating paddy in larger quantities.

the town of El Sauce, where he grew up among his hard-working, humble family. He left school at a young age, choosing to work instead, emigrating to El Salvador in search of work and helping his mother get ahead. Early on, through his own hard work, he managed to buy a tricycle taxi, which he used for work for many years. Two years ago, through a microfinancier, he managed to obtain a motor taxi, which he currently uses to make his living by moving people and cargo. F\u00e9lix is a young man with a great desire to get ahead. He has sacrificed and worked hard, and now his great dream is to have a dignified home where he can provide his wife and daughter with a better life.\r\n\r\nHe's very grateful to Kiva and to Ceprodel because they have supported him for many years with financing that has helped him to improve his life. At this time, F\u00e9lix needs a loan which he will use for the purchase of tires and a tent covering. These will help him provide his customers with better service. He hopes and trusts in God that the support he has received will continue\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1655476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle

Nurbubu has a secondary education and, to provide an additional source of income for her family, has been involved in animal husbandry since 2004 and started with a purchase of livestock. Thanks to Nurbubu's drive and hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 calf, 1 heifer and 20 sheep. Also, Nurbubu is involved in farming and sales during the season. She sells food products to local residents from her own store. In order to further develop her business, Nurbubu requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 1 bull with 40,000 som (KGS), sheep with 20,000 som (KGS) and livestock feed with the remaining amount. Nurbubu plans to resell the livestock at a local livestock market and use the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock headcount, which would lead to earning a larger total profit from sales of livestock and meat. Nurbubu's idea is that the business should help save money for her grandchildren's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1657051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a bull, sheep and livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sasyk-Bulak village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-07-30T23:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-29T23:10:05Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":54,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7475},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6595},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6760},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6929},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7102},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7280},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7462},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7648},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7839},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8035},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":272.61,"local_amount":14070,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-30T09:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":14122.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529947375},{"amount":130.97,"local_amount":6760,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6785.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542440730},{"amount":132.82,"local_amount":6929,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6954.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.43,"payment_id":561578551},{"amount":136.14,"local_amount":7102,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7128.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":579489169},{"amount":134.2,"local_amount":7280,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7307.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.85,"payment_id":595436365},{"amount":135.81,"local_amount":7462,"processed_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7489.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.77,"payment_id":610751357},{"amount":137.16,"local_amount":7648,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7676.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.02,"payment_id":624799059},{"amount":135.64,"local_amount":7839,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7868.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.24,"payment_id":636161198},{"amount":280.65,"local_amount":14910,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":14965.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.23,"payment_id":649513623}],"funded_date":"2014-08-17T19:32:15Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:39:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":746376,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is an elderly, single woman who has worked very hard throughout her life to not only support herself, but to raise her two children on her own. Over 29 years ago, Gloria began working with sick and handicapped children in the neonatal unit of a hospital in southern Florida. Gloria never missed a day of work because she knew how much these children depended on her care and they had the comfort of knowing she wouldn\u2019t let them down. Unfortunately, Gloria was forced into retirement due to a health condition that made it impossible to keep up with her physically demanding job. Due to Gloria\u2019s health, her mobility has been greatly diminished and her pain is only intensified by Florida\u2019s heat. Within the last few years, she has strived to remain as independent as possible, and with the help of her live-in daughter, she has been able to continue to live safely in her own home and avoid placement into an assisted living facility. Gloria will use her loan to pay for a new air conditioner that will replace her old unit that is over 20 years old. This new unit will lower her current energy bill, be better for the environment and help Gloria have a better quality of life, honoring all her years of hard work.

Meet Ricina, a charming mother who always has a smile on her face that makes her glow. She is 36 years old, and she hails from the Kisii area of Kenya. Kisii is one of the most fertile places on earth, where bananas are grown as a cash crop. Ricina is a dedicated farmer who practices mixed farming; that is, she grows crops and also keeps dairy cows as a source of income. Ricina has so much passion for dairy farming, and she loves taking care of her cows. She has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cMaridadi,\u201d which means beautiful. That is what the cow does to her life: it makes Ricina's life beautiful.\r\n\r\nRicina is a mother of three children. She has fought to raise them. Through her hard work she has managed to always provide for them the basic needs in life. Although, she has always had challenges because of lack of sufficient income.\r\n\r\nRicina is very enterprising and wants to utilize the large space on her farm for dairy farming. One challenge that she is facing is lack of enough capital to buy more dairy cows. She is seeking a loan of 52,000 KES to buy a dairy cow. Kisii area is an area that has good weather patterns that support dairy farming. Hence, Ricina is sure to reap more profits than ever. Through increased milk production Ricina will be able to satisfy the demand for milk in this area, which will translate to more profits.\r\n\r\nRicina is so passionate about providing a secure future for her children. Knowing that there are people out there and institutions like Kiva that support and generate progress, she feels relieved and knows that her dream will be accomplished. Ricina will use the profits from selling milk to repay the loan and to educate her children. Ricina believes that education is the only way that you can reduce poverty levels. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1655902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-07-31T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-30T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3266.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3851.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3994.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4204.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4285.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4400.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4581.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4642.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4780.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4896.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5033.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.41,"local_amount":8182.1,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8302.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054393},{"amount":47.35,"local_amount":4103.78,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4164.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547579},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":3962.03,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4020.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680567},{"amount":84.58,"local_amount":7330.04,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7438.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624846},{"amount":327.94,"local_amount":28422.05,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":28841.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193919}],"funded_date":"2014-07-31T07:29:29Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:40:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":744027,"name":"Jes\u00fas Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas es el mayor de tres hermanos, vive con ellos y su madre, ya que proviene de un hogar de padres separados.

age 33, is a farmer in Chisamba District, Zambia. Isaac has been growing onions, tomatoes, watermelon and butternut squash to sell to buyers at local markets. He plans to get a water pump that will help him realize his goals of further expanding his farm.\n\nWater pumps can be a major boost for rural farmers such as Isaac, who often struggle to irrigate their crops using watering cans and buckets. A water pump allows for farmers to water their crops more regularly, while also increasing the area they are able to cultivate. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a water pump can be very prohibitive. \n\nRent to Own has worked with Isaac on a business plan for this gardening season and will deliver a water pump directly to his farm. Rent to Own also provides Isaac with training on how to properly use and maintain the water pump, and will check in to provide support until he has paid off the loan.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1654254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to obtain a water pump for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chisamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2014-07-31T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-30T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":155.61,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":956.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530168269},{"amount":106.47,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-01T11:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":654.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561782448},{"amount":106.47,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-24T10:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":654.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579739796},{"amount":49.14,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-27T09:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":302.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595307796},{"amount":49.23,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-12T12:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":352.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.08,"payment_id":681518516}],"funded_date":"2014-07-31T13:51:31Z","paid_date":"2015-08-12T12:10:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":743482,"name":"Moeun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moeun\u2019s group live in a rural village in Prey Veng province in Cambodia.

They are now starting their second loan cycle with Namaste. They grew their businesses and learned a lot, from their classes and from their Business Adviser, during their first nine-month cycle and are eager to have more financial literacy classes and more advice in order to grow their businesses even more.\nOne of these entrepreneurial women is Sara (second from left) who is 52 years old and married with one child still in school.  She has only a third grade education but she is a smart business woman who is proud of her little store which she has had for ten years.  Her husband works as a construction worker and helps her support the family. She sells, from a storefront that is part of her house, the blouses, skirts and belts that the Guatemalan women wear.\nDuring the first loan cycle she learned many useful things such as how to keep her sales and expenses in a notebook and how to separate her personal money from her business money.  Using the advice from her Business Adviser she increased her income by 50%.  Her goal for this cycle is to offer in her store sewing materials that other seamstresses are looking for in the community.  Her goal is to increase her net income at her shop and get closer to her dream:  to invest some of her money in her house in order to create better living conditions for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3075,"image":{"id":1654580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sewing materials for her store to sell to other seamstresses in her community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Tierras del Pueblo, Suchitpequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2014-07-31T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-30T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosenda Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":2666.69,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-11T10:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2670.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530026850},{"amount":381.74,"local_amount":2979.42,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-23T09:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2983.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542519118},{"amount":643.27,"local_amount":5020.57,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5028.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561652798},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2670.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581607297},{"amount":230.8,"local_amount":1801.37,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1804.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595165312},{"amount":452.53,"local_amount":3531.97,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3537.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610562063},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2670.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624235306},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":2666.64,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2670.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636221220}],"funded_date":"2014-08-25T17:16:40Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:43:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":744409,"name":"Cynthia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cynthia is a married woman and has 2 dependent children.

He began working with Ruma 6 months ago because he wanted to increase his income and he's also interested in expanding his networks.

She lives with her husband Niranjan and their two sons in the small village of Tekatuli in Jalpaiguri district.  In her childhood, she did not get the opportunity for education.  She is illiterate and can only sign her name.  Her husband has an education until grade nine.  Both of their sons attend school and they are in different grades in secondary school.\r\n\r\nGautami is a homemaker and her husband is engaged in cultivation of tea plant.  Over these years of tireless work, he has been able to get success in his business, which is profitable enough to cover household expenses. Gautami plans to expand the family's agribusiness by making some investments.  They want to grow more tea plants.  Since Jalpaiguri is a district where the soil and climate are perfectly suitable for tea plantation, they have chosen cultivation of tea plants.  They are in need of financial support.\r\n\r\nGautami applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase tea saplings, fertilizers and other necessary materials to start cultivation. She hopes to earn a good profit from this new business through this loan.  Her first priority is her children's education.  So she wants to provide them with better education as well as good food and health.\r\n\r\nShe conveys her thanks to BJS and

Both are illiterate because their parents had poor economic resources.\r\n\r\nKanika and her husband are not officially employed because of their illiteracy. Moreover, it is difficult to find work in the village. That is why her husband Chitta is involved in agricultural work. But the income from this business can hardly cover their necessary expenses. Kanika rears cattle for additional income for the family. For the last two years, she has been engaged in these activities.  She is a hardworking, active and ambitious woman who wants to get ahead in life.  She works hard all day long, does her household jobs and looks after her cattle.  She has a dairy cow. She sells milk in her locality.  Now to cope with the growing expenses of her family, she needs financial support to improve her business by purchasing one more cow.\r\n\r\nSo, she is requesting a loan from BJS to purchase a cow and fodder.

Guatemala who specializes in jade and sterling silver pieces. He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of silver and jade.\r\n\r\nPedro has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is his story:\r\n\r\nAfter working for silversmiths for six years, Pedro and his family decided to open their own workshop. They are all involved in the family business. \"We've developed a good working relationship,\" says Pedro. \"Everyone specializes in a different aspect and we complement each others' work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very grateful for another opportunity to receive microcredit. These loans have helped us to continue improving our operation and purchase raw materials at a better price. We recently lost several large jade stones to theft; each stone weighed over 50 pounds, so it was a big loss for us and it brought our production down to a very low level.

is undeniable. A fashionista from the day she was born, Olivia spent her early years altering and mending clothes for herself and her six siblings.\r\n\r\nLater in life, her love for fashion brought her to a major upscale clothing boutique, where Olivia climbed the ranks to store manager. It was while she was working in the fashion industry that Olivia had the epiphany that started her on the path to entrepreneurship: there are plenty of places to get inexpensive and practical clothes for kids. There are also places to get fashionable clothes for kids, though they are often flimsy and impractical. But there just isn\u2019t anywhere to get fashionable clothes for kids that are well-wrought and practical.\r\n\r\nThis great idea marked the beginning of a lot of hard work and struggle to turn an idea into a business. Between securing funding, dealing with manufacturing and logistics, and designing an entire line of children\u2019s clothing from scratch, Olivia has had no trouble keeping busy recently.\r\n\r\nWith the help of her head designer, who she met back when she was managing the upscale boutique, Olivia has her eyes set on creating the next great fashion empire. She will use her Kiva loan to pay for patterns and samples, inventory, and costs associated with creating a new website. This is a unique opportunity for Kiva donors to say they helped make America\u2019s next great brand a

why she decided to start a business caring for the elderly and infirm. All through her life, whenever a family member fell ill, Lucy was first to step up and lend her time and energies toward helping that person recover.\r\n\r\nLucy was very close to her grandmother growing up, so she was devastated to learn that her grandmother had developed Alzheimer\u2019s and was put in an institution while she was away at college. Lucy decided then and there that she would do everything possible to keep her loved ones from ending up in institutions.\r\n\r\nLater on, when she saw her sister run a successful in-home care business in South Carolina, Lucy came to the conclusion that this would be her ticket to financial independence. Her sister has been running the in-home care business for 15 years, and Lucy has found her advice about how to start another operation in San Diego to be invaluable.\r\n\r\nBut business strategies don\u2019t always translate perfectly from one state to another, as Lucy has found. Regulations in California are often very different from South Carolina when it comes to the elderly and infirm, which left Lucy without any easy answers coming from her sister. Nonetheless, with time and hard work, Lucy has managed to clear all the regulatory hurdles she\u2019s encountered, and is ready to take the next step forward.\r\n\r\nLucy will spend her Kiva loan on initial office setup costs and covering payroll during the early phases of her business. If there is any money left over, Lucy hopes to start building a reserve so that she can cover payroll in the event that there is some delay in Medicare payouts.\r\n\r\nUltimately, she derives most of her satisfaction at the job from knowing that she is keeping her clients at home and out of institutions. When Lucy sees a discharged patient make a full recovery or an elderly client be able to maintain independence, it reminds her why she started her business in the first

business with compassion. Working as an accountant and bookkeeper, Giovanni missed the personal interaction that was severely lacking when his head was buried in financial statements all day.\r\n\r\nThen, in early 2010, he connected with some old friends who had moved to LA after spending some time working as EMTs in Las Vegas. He started researching the local ambulance care industry and found that there were opportunities for startups, given shifting demographics and the like. Merging Giovanni\u2019s finance and accounting background with his partner\u2019s background in entrepreneurship, they founded Quality 1 Care Ambulance.\r\n\r\nNow, Giovanni feels the business is ready to expand from the LA area down to San Diego. Growth rarely comes without setbacks, the greatest of which is finding the right people to staff their new operations. Maintaining accurate and productive communication between employees, ensuring that office staff all get along, and being able to provide accurate arrival time estimates for customers while in the field are just a few of the difficulties in running an ambulance care service.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Giovanni is confident he will be able to transfer the business model that has worked successfully in LA for the last four years to San Diego. He will use his Kiva loan to pay for costs associated with expansion, including renting an office space, payroll, and buying or leasing vehicles.\r\n\r\nFor Giovanni, the occasional struggles and headaches are all worthwhile because of the satisfaction he derives from knowing he is providing compassionate care, and treating customers as if they were family. With your help, Giovanni and his employees can continue to preserve life and provide top-notch service in the

They are all Maya Kich\u00e9 and quite proud of their culture and heritage.\r\n\r\nDolores is the President of the Trust Bank. She is 51 years old, married and has three children. She is quite pleased that all three are in school because she understands that with education, they will have more opportunities and their standard of living will be much higher than hers. This dedicated woman sells medicinal plants, vitamins, soaps, lotions and shampoos that are 100% natural. The growing demand for her products motivates her to acquire new products in order to diversify her inventory and increase sales. For these reasons, she is requesting a new loan.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank benefit greatly from the educational sessions in their monthly meetings. Acquiring new personal and business tools enables them to have more self-confidence and self-esteem. Friendship Bridge realizes that the combination of the loans and education, which the organization calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d, is quite effective for the ladies to empower themselves. At their monthly meetings, the women learn about how to successfully manage their loans with presentations about accounting, budgeting, pricing, marketing and customer service. Their personal lives are enhanced with knowledge about health, hygiene and nutrition, as well as women\u2019s rights and leadership.\r\n\r\nDolores and the women express their appreciation to Kiva lenders for their kindness in funding the loans. The women promise to work hard and pay the loans back in full and on time. We look forward to reporting on their progress in a future report.

Guatemala. It is well-known for the use of natural dyes, including carrots, seeds and leaves. Beautiful textiles are woven using traditional back-strap and foot looms. There are many women\u2019s cooperatives in this town. In addition, the area is farmed with corn, beans and coffee. Animals are raised as well. Entire families participate in these endeavors.\r\n\r\nTen enthusiastic ladies between the ages of 26 and 57 years old have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEsmeraldas\u201d meaning \u201cEmeralds\u201d. They have recently welcomed a new member who is anxious to take out her first loan for her small business!\r\n\r\nThe President of the group is Gemina who is 27 years old and has two children who are her inspiration. She has attended primary school and appreciates the educational program that Friendship Bridge offers at the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank.  The women acquire personal and business tools, which make them feel more empowered and hopeful about the future. They know that education is vital and work hard so that their children can go to school.\r\n\r\nGemina has a small workspace where she sews cotton clothing in various sizes and designs. She works with her husband in the business and has two employees who are family members. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase a sewing machine that will jump start her into a higher level of production. Gemina looks forward to supplying her customers with increased inventory, both in the local market and in the capital, Guatemala City. She reflects that the success of her business is due to her effective business planning and acquired educational knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cEsmeraldas\u201d Trust Bank and Gemina are very happy to be able to access credit from loans funded by Kiva lenders. Armed with their loans and educational support, the women look forward to a brighter future for themselves, their families and their community of San Juan La Laguna. Thank you, Kiva lenders, for your generosity!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1656157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 34 years old, and has two children who are currently in school. Mario, her husband, works as a driver. She oversees the operation of their jeepney unit, and her income from the business helps with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe has one jeepney unit (of 14-16 person capacity) from which she is paid boundary fees each day. In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (called the 'boundary') for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the boundary fee, minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\nHer regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,500 PHP every day. Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that are typical to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nMarilou is requesting a loan of 11,000 PHP to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes for her business to prosper and that she will be able to have expansions. She dreams for her family to always be in good living condition and to lack nothing. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. (All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Carrying his fishing nets he goes to his boat and out on the lake, returning with his catch at noon to unload the fish and fix the nets.  Before the end of the afternoon he does the same routine as in the morning and returns by night, leaving everything ready for the next day.  It is a tiring job and he has been doing it for approximately 30 years.  His work entails renovating the boat and buying new fishing nets in order to pay for his four children's expenses.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Gregorio is requesting a loan to buy a boat and fishing nets so he

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Teresita wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan amounting to 20,000 PHP to buy additional grocery items that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nTeresita aspires to grow her business and earn more from it so she can afford to send her children to college.

Now, as a Babban Gona member, she finally has the opportunity to access credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Saratu can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags of maize\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Saratu, is ambitious and is aiming to reap a total of 30 bags on her 0.30 ha farm. By doing so, Saratu will finally have enough money to make significant life changes.

Without this loan, he would  be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive, but are often diluted with external products like sand.

He is a farmer. He studied through the fifth grade and he has had a difficult time obtaining well-paying jobs due to his low academic level. Due to this, he has had to work in agriculture to support his family. He is married and has 4 children who attend school. His wife is a housewife who supports him a lot so their children can get ahead. \r\n\r\nJorge has worked in agriculture since he was small. He wakes up very early to go to the fields near his house to work. He also sells sweet bread and french bread. He does this in the afternoon by traveling to other communities surrounding his home on a motorcycle.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he will buy agricultural products such as manure, pesticides, and seeds. Jorge's dream is to have a big harvest so he can repay the loan on time.

","en":"Kunduz is 29 years old, married and has a school-age son. Kunduz has a secondary education. She is calm, leveled and hardworking. To provide an aditional source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for many years, having started this business practically with nothing. Thanks to Kunduz's hard work, today her business contains 10 sheep and a 1.50 hectare land plot, where she grows clover. Kunduz's business yields about 20,000 som (KGS) per month. Her husband and son help her with the business. Kunduz's husband also works at a factory. Through their joint effort, Kunduz and her husband made repairs at home, leaving only the attic unfinished. In order to complete the repairs in the attic, insulating and converting it into a children's room, Kunduz requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank.

For the past four years, she has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 800000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda buy more new clothes to sell. This will help her to generate greater profits and provide for the family's basic needs. She hopes that in the future she will be able to open another branch of the same business. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

preacher and lives with his wife and his four kids in the town of Les Anglais in southern Haiti. Their green and brown house has no reliable access to electricity and thus, Joel is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. With three of his kids still in school, he wishes they had better light for studying at night. A solar-powered micro-grid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Joel and his family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower-cost energy source. He is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to cover the upfront cost of connection to the grid, which he will repay through his payments for electricity.\n\nAn electrical connection dramatically reduces the cost of lighting in towns such as Les Anglais while offering far superior light quality and more generally providing opportunities for people to dramatically improve their quality of life.\n\nTo

She would like to thank all the lenders for their generosity in providing such a great loan for poor people like her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1654863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to build a hygienic latrine ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 105.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2014-07-31T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-30T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":333400},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333400},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333400},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333400},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333400},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":333000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":333400,"processed_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":338133.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624245169},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":333400,"processed_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":338133.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636239415},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":333400,"processed_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":338133.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649582510},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":333400,"processed_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":338133.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665445172},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":333400,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":338133.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681361440},{"amount":83.25,"local_amount":333000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":337728.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696571618}],"funded_date":"2014-07-31T19:01:17Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:19:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Supryia Ray","image":null}},{"id":744882,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is a 40-year-old hard-working woman, married to Francis who earns additional income for the family.

daughter, who goes to school. She has been in business for two years managing a butcher shop, selling beef and fish. She is also involved in the poultry business, raising 200 chickens for egg production. She is a busy mother, always trying to learn more from successfully people. Ully has business helpers and works from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. every working day, making a good profit each month. .\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventh loan which she will use to slaughter a cow for her butcher shop instead of buying meat in kilos. With the previous loans, which she repaid successfully, she started the butcher shop, bought a new photocopying machine and more paper.

She has a secondary-technical education. Vera is currently retired. As the main source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding and sells milk. She started this business in 1996 with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Vera's hard work, she currently has one dairy cow on her farm. She also has a 1.60 hectare plot of land which she leases out. Her cumulative monthly income is, on average, 8,000 som (KGS).

Gulkair has a secondary education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, Gulkair has been involved in agriculture since 1996, starting this business with 15,000 som (KGS). Her business contains 1 dairy cow, 1 calf and 1 horse, and a 1.0 hectare land plot, where she annually plants potatoes, cereal crops and sainfoin for farm use and sale. Gulkair also sells milk, dairy products, meat and livestock at a local market. Thanks for Gulkair's hard work, her business yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to further develop her business, Gulkair requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock to increase her income from sales of milk and meat.

","en":"Rukhshona is a young resident of the Shahrituz district. She is 22 years old, married and lives with her husband in his parents' house. Rukhshona's husband is a history and law teacher, but at the present time he is involved in construction work. Rukhshona is a homemaker and is not employed anywhere. Now she wants to start her own business and bring a new source of income home. Rukhshona chose the animal husbandry field because she knows how to take care of livestock and has a large barn for keeping livestock in the yard of their home. Besides, her husband's family owns 0.8 hectares of land and will use part of the land to grow livestock feed. Rukhshona has about 200 US dollars as a starting capital, but because livestock is expensive, she is requesting the remaining amount as a loan. Rukhshona plans to buy three heads of cattle for fattening up and resale. She hopes to obtain financial support to successfully start this business. Support Rukhshona.
