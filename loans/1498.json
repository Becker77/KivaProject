Like all Babban Gona members, Hannatu can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags of maize\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Hannatu, is ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 35 bags per hectare this season. By doing so, Hannatu will finally have enough money to make significant life changes.

This fish species was introduced into the lake for the benefit of the people who live there. It is very popular with the locals and with visitors. \r\n\r\nRicardo does not have the financial means to invest in his business and to pay for the food and education of his children.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why Ricardo asks for a loan: to buy fishing nets and, with the profit he makes, to pay for what his 6 children need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1654421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Now, as a Babban Gona member, he finally has the opportunity to access credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Matiyu can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags of maize\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Matiyu is ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 35 bags per hectare this season. By doing so, Matiyu will finally have enough money to make significant life changes. When asked what he plans to do with his income from this season, he said: \u201cI plan to use the money I make to expand my farmland\u201d.

That is why Joseph is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 to buy a dairy cow. Through the loan, he will be able to satisfy the increasing client base and the already-developed market that is there and be able to fully support his family.\r\n\r\nThrough increased profits from selling milk, Joseph is sure that he will satisfy his family's needs and he will not need any financial assistance from anybody.\r\n\r\nJoseph plans to accumulate more  profits and buy more dairy cows and also employ people to help him in his farm.

Meet Moses, 56 years of age, who is a very responsible and hardworking man. He hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and good soils that favor crop and dairy farming. Moses makes a living through farming and has been doing that for five years. Over those years, he has been able to earn a decent and honest living.\r\n \r\nMoses loves nature and has even planted trees in his compound so that his farm can be beautiful. He also loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cow \u201cmaridadi\u201d which means beautiful and that is what the cow is to Moses' life. \r\n\r\nMoses is very enterprising and wants to increase the number of dairy cows on his farm. This is because he has enough space and already a market for milk in the Kitale area. Because of these valid reasons, he is kindly requesting a loan of KES 52,000 to be able to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nWith the dairy cow, Moses is sure of reaping more profits, being able to improve his living conditions and providing a secure future for his children. Moses does not want to be economically empowered alone. That is why he plans to buy more cows and open a dairy shop where he will employ other people to work for him, hence boosting their standards of living.

cheerful, hardworking, 32-year-old man. He is married but does not yet have any children. He turned to Arvand for the first time when he realized that there was an opportunity to receive financial support. Alisher lives with his family in the countryside. He does not have a higher education as he did not have the opportunity to study at university due to financial difficulties in his family. His wife also does not have a higher education. She is a homemaker who does the household chores and will raise their children in the future. <br \/><br \/>In order to have an income to live on, Alisher runs his own business. He fattens up and resells cattle. He receives a good income from this business. Alisher's wife helps him with this business. She sells the milk, which she gets from the cattle, at the market. Now Alisher wants to increase his number of cattle to expand his business. This is why he turned to Arvand to receive a loan to buy cattle. Alisher really relies on a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for their

cheerful and hardworking 34-year-old woman. She is married and has two children. She lives with her family in the countryside in a small house. She does not have a higher education as she did not have the opportunity to study at university due to financial difficulties in her family. Instead, she became a homemaker. She takes care of the household chores and raises her children. <br \/><br \/>In order to have a stable income to live on, Bibizaynab does her favorite activity - she takes custom orders for sewing women's dresses. Bibizaynab's husband is currently working abroad in Russia. Bibizaynab also has an additional business. She buys children's clothes at the wholesale bazaar and sells the merchandise at her local market. She makes a good income from these businesses. Now Bibizaynab wants to increase her amount of merchandise so that she can expand her business and make a larger profit in order to feed her children. This is why she turned to Arvand to receive a loan to buy children's clothes for retail sale. Bibizaynab really relies on a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1658650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The loan will be used to buy more cassava flour and cooking oil for the business, and will help Maureen to generate greater profits and supplement her siblings\u2019 school fees. Maureen hopes that in the future, she will be able to increase her sales and save some money. \r\n\r\nMaureen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is married and has 2 children aged 35 and 28. Many years ago, she established her meat shop business. Working 6 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy goats and chickens. In the future, Ankil Devi plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n \r\nIn Nepal, the meat is always fresh.

Meet Emmanuel, a very young man, full of energy and a very dedicated farmer who is just 22 years of age. He hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and has good soil. Being very young, he is very ambitious and wants to achieve the best for himself and as he likes to put it, \u201cthe sky is the limit for me\u201d. Emmanuel never got any formal employment but this did not kill his morale of succeeding in life. He started farming two years ago and has been making so much progress. Through farming, he has been able to acquire a dairy cow and do crop and poultry farming.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel sells milk to his neighbors and the nearby market but his dairy cow has not been fully producing milk. This is because his cow sometimes is sick. Emmanuel does not have a good dairy unit where his cow can rest and hence, his cow is affected by bad weather and falls sick. He spends so much money buying medicine for his cow that he does not have much money to save. That is why he is seeking kindly a KES 40,000 loan to be able to build a dairy unit.\r\n\r\nThe dairy unit will provide his cow with a good place to rest and a good feeding place for the cow when he is milking the cow. Through this, he is assured of high milk production and spending zero on medicine. Hence, this will help him save more money.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel is very optimistic and he is sure that through the loan, he is going to have a secure future. He plans that once he has saved enough money, he will be able to advance his education since education is the \u201ckey to

Raymart and his younger brother would do menial jobs such as construction work and planting sugarcane tops just to have money and buy their food. But Raymart knows that his chance to have a decent and a high paying job would come.

Dayyabu joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his  children. Dayyabu is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. For the first time, Dayyabu will have access to quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed. Without this loan, he would be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive but are often diluted with external products such as sand.

While their children are all working, the support coming from Victorina's children is hardly sufficient in as much as her children have their own families to support now. \n\nWhen Victorina's husband became sick four years ago, she and her husband decided to set up a small store in their house. Selling usual food items consisting of canned goods, toiletries, laundry needs and snack items, Victorina was able to earn enough for their day-to-day expenses and shoulder some medicines for her husband. In 2011, Victorina went to SEED's office which was just near their residence, to inquire for the loan. She went through the process and was consequently provided with a first loan. With the first loan from SEED, Victorina was able to increase her stocks and earn more. \n\nFrom her earnings, Victorina decided to invest in rooms for rent. She had the extra space from her house repaired and converted into two rooms for single bed-space occupancy or for renting out to a small family. The earnings from these rooms for rent ensured Victorina's steady monthly income which sustains her husband's medical checks-up and medication.\n\nOn her 8th loan now, Victorina is continuously innovating with her business. She plans to buy rice, sugar and condiments in bulk and have those repacked prior to reselling to her store. Victorina realized that repacking food items enables her to earn more compared to selling those in usual packs in kilos. For condiments such as pepper and salt, Victorina says that her income triples and at the same time she is able to respond to her customer's buying capacity in retail.\n\nWith this business realization and plan, Victorina hopes to earn and save more for her to be able to set up another room for rent and therefore add up to another stable source of income for her family.\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1657774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

As a Babban Gona member, Barau is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Barau can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Barau is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 35 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Barau is hopeful about what the future holds; he  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, he will finally be able to afford to educate his children; Hadiza,  and  A'I.

She's 29 years old and is living with her husband and their two boys, aged 9 and 3. The older boy attends school, but the other one doesn't yet because the community doesn't have preschool options. Her husband works in Limones for an institution that protects the environment and ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAnabel herself is a teacher hired by a school in the village. For the time being, she has her university studies on hold since her work doesn't allow her to be able to attend classes. She had previously expected to raise chickens, but she changed her mind and will plant coconuts, which she will later sell in Borb\u00f3n y Guayaquil. It's a good business, and she will be able to take advantage of family land where nothing is currently growing. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy coconut seed so that she can plant it, since this is just the right season. Within three years, she hopes to have become a small business owner with her own shop, selling her produce to neighbors.

Santos is requesting this loan so that he can buy seed, fertilizer, manure, fungicides, herbicides, etc. This will enable him to continue planting his crops and providing his family with greater economic stability."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1656361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"purchase farming supplies, such as seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636146105}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T19:56:19Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:25:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":745071,"name":"Salome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salome, 23 years old, is from the city of  Batumi.

She has had a business doing hand embroidery for the past five years. She is passionate about her work, and client demand is strong, but business challenges, combined with family expenditures, frustrate her nearly every day. Her husband is employed as a sales person in a grocery store, but he does not earn enough to support his family well. Maqsooda's embroidery patterns are very popular on her street, and she is the best earning resource in her household. She is a mother of four children.\r\n\r\nMaqsooda wants to grow her business, so she requested a loan of 40,000 PKR to buy raw materials such as thread, sequins and pearls in large quantities to meet the increasing demand. She shared her dream of running a training center for the girls of her village. Maqsooda is also interested in opening her own shop in the market to display her

Meet Kosgei, a 42-year-old father of 7 adorable children that always bring a pleasant feeling when they are all at home. He hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, an area that is a city of champions. Being a father of 7 comes with lots of responsibility and feeding this large family requires a lot of hard work and hence Kosgei has to put in extra efforts to comfortably take care of his family.\r\nKosgei started farming just after finishing  high school since he never advanced his education and because of the high unemployment rate he ventured into farming and he has never regretted this because of the profits he has been making.    \r\nKosgei practices mixed farming and is regarded as one of the hardworking farmers in his village because he is able to juggle between keeping dairy cows and also doing crop farming.\r\nKosgei is a visionary and enterprising person and has always wanted to do dairy farming in large scale but one of the challenges he has faced is lack of enough capital. That is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow. Through the loan Kosgei is confident that his life will be transformed and his dream of providing a secure future for his children will be achieved. Kosgei is relieved to know that his life can be secured through partners such as Kiva lenders who help small scale and aspiring men such as Kosgei. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":658.39,"image":{"id":1657034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kosgei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2371.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3088.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3226.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3258.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3395.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3437.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3530.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3745.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3726.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3860.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3930.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4063.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4146.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4257.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4388.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4490.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4619.9},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4736.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.93,"local_amount":8271.96,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8510.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054400},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":3879.21,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3990.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547587},{"amount":59.9,"local_amount":5112.27,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5259.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680580},{"amount":56.79,"local_amount":4847.07,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4986.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624857},{"amount":51.98,"local_amount":4436.55,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4564.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193931},{"amount":210.3,"local_amount":17948.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":18464.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600124},{"amount":125.6,"local_amount":11695.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":12032.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.44,"payment_id":711505082}],"funded_date":"2014-08-27T13:48:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":745052,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Marie  est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant dans le quartier d\u2019Adidogom\u00e9.

She would like to invest in a bulk purchase of alpaca yarn for her sweaters.\r\n\r\nCorina has been selling through NOVICA since 2013. This is her story:\r\n\r\n'We met when we were children, and though we lived apart, we kept in touch through the years. Jesus learned to weave from his mother and grandmother, and in 2012 he suggested we form a society together. At first I wasn't sure, but we kept talking about it and two months later, I accepted the proposal and this is why I'm in this field now. We've been working on small projects but we're looking for ways to export our designs. Jesus is in charge of weaving and I take care of the administration, but I'm also learning to design sweaters. Jesus and I make a great team \u2014 I've learned a lot about the textile arts and I really admire his dedication to this work. We hope to do much more and, with the grace of God, we expect to be able to. We love what we do and are involved in all the details of creating our apparel. Everything you receive from us is made with much love and dedication by two young entrepreneurs who are seeking success. We're giving this project everything we've got.'\r\n\r\n'I'd like to thank you all for helping us grow through this microcredit. It will allow us to purchase the yarn we need to produce a large supply of sweaters.'\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Corina's 100% alpaca apparel on the NOVICA site:<br>\r\n<a

Caroline hopes that the loan of 1,500,000 UGX can enable her to achieve her objectives and she thanks Ugafode for the support it extends to people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1657053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":301868.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530923245},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676616},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561810224},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579786521},{"amount":57.45,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":595336152},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611969964},{"amount":56.96,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":624410442},{"amount":55.21,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":636758770},{"amount":55.34,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-25T12:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":150934.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.16,"payment_id":651654740}],"funded_date":"2014-08-14T02:37:48Z","paid_date":"2015-05-25T12:10:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate McKinna","image":null}},{"id":745188,"name":"Moshi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephina is in her late twenties and married, and together they are blessed with a baby girl.

He is 47 this year and happily married with five children. His children are 26, 20, 18, 14 and 8 years old, respectively. All five of them are currently attending school. Paul lives with his family in Cape Coast, the regional capital of the Central Region of Ghana.\r\n\r\nPaul owns a welding company. He has been in business for the past 20 years. He is the founder of the company and has built the company up from scratch. Today, he has five permanent employees and more than 10 part-time workers. His company manufactures a whole range of products, including housing features and household appliances. His company is even able to remodel scrapped cars. \r\n\r\nPaul is beloved by the local community and has earned the endearing nickname \"Opoman\" for the Opoman canopy that he had invented. Prior to this invention, Ghanaians in his community used natural materials such as bamboo and palm leaves to build makeshift shelters for outdoor events such as funerals and soccer matches. These lacked structural integrity and did not provide adequate shelter in rain; in fact, when the rain came, people would abandon the shelter and run away! An extremely enterprising and creative man, Paul designed a cost-effective canopy comprising a metal framework with a waterproof canvas. This product was immensely well-received by consumers. Even then, he did not remain content with this breakthrough and has continually improved this product based on consumer feedback. He has since furnished the design with fluorescent light and electric fans, allowing these temporary shelters to provide not only safety, but also utility and comfort. \r\n\r\nPaul's most recent endeavor is the manufacturing of clean-cook stoves (a.k.a the Elsa Stove) that utilise waste-products, such as palm-kennel shells, as fuel. This stove is the product of a research project by the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and sanctioned by the European Union (EU). He is now applying for a micro-loan to purchase raw materials such as metal plates, as well as the equipment needed for precise welding. Paul is very ambitious and excited about this product. He has secured an agreement with local distributors and plans to sell these stoves to consumers in the entire Central Region, and eventually expand the market to the whole country. Your loan will go a long way, not just in helping Paul achieve his ambitions, but also in providing Ghanians with a safer means of cooking that is free of indoor and outdoor pollution and reduces deforestation.

With access to high quality inputs, Antoni can reap up to 30 bags\/hectare, double the national average of 14  and  earn up to $2000\/ha, more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.  When asked, Antoni said \u201cI plan to use the money I make this year to provide more food and clothing for my family. Antoni is not thinking about just this year; he said, \u201cin 5 years, I want to become the  most profitable farmer in my community.\u201d \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":1662152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To access high-quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed in order to double income and yield.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T06:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T06:40:03Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.2,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antoni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":6958,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6958}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.8,"local_amount":6958,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8104.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.2,"payment_id":752024416}],"funded_date":"2014-08-01T07:13:46Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:00:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":745357,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita is married with four children.

They are from a community called Santa Rosa del Pe\u00f1\u00f3n and are known for being hardworking and responsible with a desire to personally succeed. Unfortunately they were not able to study for careers because they needed to go to work at a young age to help with the household expenses. Currently they are working hard to provide a better future for their children and an opportunity for them to get the education they did not have access to.  Thanks to their efforts and determination to get ahead, the members have different business activities such as a grocery store, raising pigs, selling food, a welding workshop, and a bakery.\r\n\r\nThe coordinator of the group is Mar\u00eda del Rosario who sells home-cooked food from home to the public in general and workers in the area.  Her work schedule is 12 hours a day from very early in the morning when she gets up to prepare and cook the food.  This includes several different dishes such as fried chicken, chicken soup, rice, bananas, meat pries, fried beans, etc.  The aim of the loan is to buy ingredients for her food so she can earn more income and keep her clientele.  She also wants to meet her goals, such as preparing her children for an education and to finish her house.   The \u201cEl Mana\u201d communal association is grateful for the help that the Kiva lenders provide to people of limited resources in poor countries such as Nicaragua, so that they can have a dignified source of work.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1656395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients to make home-cooked foods such as fried chicken, chicken soup, rice, bananas, meat pies, fried beans, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T07:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T07:10:13Z","loan_amount":4200,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleyda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yarleni Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Osmany Grabiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thelma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Cela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":109000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":13625},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":13625},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":13625},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":13625},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":13625},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13625},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":13625},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":13625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":745366,"name":"Estrella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estrella is from Calaca-an, Plaridel.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14.
