His dream is to have a house he owns and a bigger bakery; this is why he fights each day.\r\nThis is the reason why Carlos requests a loan to buy flour at wholesale and start achieving his dreams little by little.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1656342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour at wholesale to achieve his dreams little by little.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":418.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":485.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":511.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":556.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":553.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":602.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":631.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":645.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":673.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":705.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.24,"local_amount":418.25,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":423.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531211389},{"amount":71.11,"local_amount":485.61,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":491.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542512638},{"amount":74.13,"local_amount":506.25,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":512.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561645943},{"amount":74.96,"local_amount":511.92,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":517.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556436},{"amount":81.52,"local_amount":556.72,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":563.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157125},{"amount":81.11,"local_amount":553.96,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":560.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554031},{"amount":580.93,"local_amount":3967.29,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4013.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226581}],"funded_date":"2014-08-30T22:19:50Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T11:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":745519,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy is 39 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

For the past 2 years, Suzan Faith has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fast foods. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Suzan Faith has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cooking oil and charcoal that will be used in the business, and it will help Suzan Faith to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young sister. Suzan Faith hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another business selling cooked food. \r\n\r\nSuzan Faith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

He has a wife and three children: two boys and a girl, who study at the neighboring school. For his restaurant, Joseph has a small solar system that he uses to power his television set. The presence of the television attracts many customers especially during the night, when people are interested in watching the news. Unfortunately, his solar system is not big enough to power his television all evening, causing him to lose customers and revenue. For lighting, he uses small dry cell battery and kerosene powered lamps which are expensive and do not provide adequate lighting for his family and business needs. \n\nThe presence of a solar powered micro-grid in Naikarra will allow the residents to run their businesses longer, more efficiently, and in a healthy environment. Their businesses will now be free from the smoky kerosene lamps, noisy generators, dim candles, and the inefficient DC solar systems that they currently use. As for Joseph, he will be able to keep his restaurant open later, offer phone charging services, and provide cold beverages to his customers. He plans to take his children to a better school, expand his restaurant, and open a lodging with his increased profits.\n\nIn addition to Joseph, the micro-grid will serve fourteen other customers. They are Kanasa, James, Cecilia, Alex, Eric, Khadija, Adan, Ali, Meeyu, Habiba, Maria, Nuney, Charles, and Vincent. They all look forward to increased economic activity in the town through the efficient and affordable energy the micro-grid will

These women have been able to gain substantial experience in the program after 10 [loan] cycles, or about five years of life together. The group members live in the same village and are motivated by a sense of mutual assistance and support. They are very active in trade and grow food crops during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayo ([standing] at right with her hand raised) is the group's featured borrower. She is 28 years old, married, and the mother of four children. She sells groundnut paste, a very profitable business in the area. To do this, she purchases unshelled nuts in sacks of 50kg, usually at the weekly international market in the sub-region, then conducts her business turning [them into paste], which she does beautifully.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, Mrs. Haya plans to purchase unshelled nuts by the 50kg sack with the goal of producing 10 buckets of 20kg [each] for the [next] step. The profits will allow her to improve her cash flow while increasing her savings on one hand, while on the other allowing her to better contribute to the improvement of her family's living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3800,"image":{"id":1658082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase unshelled nuts by the 50kg sack in order to produce 10 buckets of 20kg [each] for the [next] step.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":3800,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":257.7,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hayo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tacko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coundiesy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koudio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dienabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama Sireng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama Fissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Borobourou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba Assane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnouma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tening","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba Senghor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souboum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siring","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1855000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1855000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3542.3,"local_amount":1855000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:21:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1855874.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":257.7,"payment_id":610528723}],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T17:05:27Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:21:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessalyn Pinneo","image":603028}},{"id":745612,"name":"Pulemalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pulemalie is 37 years old, married and the mother of five children.

She grows vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, carrots, cabbage, chilies, ladies finger (okra), etc. on her farm located in the same village. She sells her products at wholesale to the traders of the nearby market as well as at retail by going to villages. Apart from this, she also has a dairy farm of five cows. She supplies milk to the tea stalls of a nearby town. \r\n\r\nShe earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from the above two income sources. But this income is not sufficient for her to manage the family expenses along with the vegetable farm and dairy farm expenses. So, to earn some extra income for smooth maintenance of the above, Kunti, along with twelve other women of her village, formed a Self-Help Group (SHG) named Shri Ganesh to avail a loan of 16,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nShe will utilize a part of the present loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs such as seeds and pesticides, and the rest of the amount for purchasing another milking cow. She hopes that this investment will help her to gain additional income to fulfill her dream of giving higher education to her daughters.\r\n\r\nAnother seven members of the SHG are doing vegetable cultivation with vending, three are selling milk, one member is running a general store and one member is running an auto repair shop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1655662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase seeds, pesticides and another milking cow to gain additional income to fulfill her dream of giving higher education to her daughters.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Gadramunda,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shasirekha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gauri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rayamati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suruj","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jochana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jagyasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tribeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jomadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":172000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":172000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":744419,"name":"Chayna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chayna is a rural woman of 28 years.

Chayna studied until grade 9, and did not get the opportunity to study further due to their parents' poverty. Her husband has a primary education.

He is the only earning member for the family and always strives for the betterment of his family. Chayna, though a housewife, helps her husband in his agricultural activities. They mainly cultivate seasonal vegetables and fruits and sell them in the local market. But it is difficult for them to run a family of five members in a decent way with such a small income. They thought to expand their business and start cultivation of jute, which is a profitable crop, but they cannot fulfill their dream due to lack of capital.\r\n\r\nSo, Chayna has applied for a loan from BJS to purchase jute seeds and other necessary things related to cultivation.

Bana and her husband both are illiterate and can sign their names only. The poor economic resources of their parents did not provide them with elementary education. Their sons are getting education and are in grade 9 and grade 7 respectively.\r\n\r\nBana's husband is a farmer. He has been farming on their small land for many years and supplements their family's income. But the current business does not provide them with enough money to meet their family's needs. Financially, she wants to give support to her husband and family. She wants to start her own business, cultivating paddy on their land and selling the produce in the local market. She has given preference to this business, since paddy cultivation is a very profitable business in their area. \r\n\r\nSo, she applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, BJS. She is going to use her loan to buy good-quality paddy seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for her farmland to cultivate paddy and get a plentiful harvest. She hopes that the business will provide sufficient support to run her family well and give a secure future to her family.\r\n\r\nHer desire for the future is to be able to provide higher education to her sons so that they can be established in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1655997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase agricultural inputs to cultivate paddy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-01T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-08-31T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-02T21:01:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":745649,"name":"Telesia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Telesia is 25 years old and married, with two children.

of Odisha, India united together and formed a Self-Help Group named Maa Mangala-B to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the further development of their existing businesses. All of them hail from a poor background. Sarojini is one of them and is standing with a raised hand in the photo. She is 48 years old and residing with her husband and a son of 25 years. \r\n\r\nSarojini has a vegetable cultivation farm in her village with a traditional water-lifting system from the dug well. She and her husband look after the farm. They produce vegetables such as brinjal, cauliflower, carrots, cabbage, chilies, cucumber, papaya, ladies finger (okra), popcorn, etc. on the farm. Traders come to her farm for taking the produce. \r\n\r\nSarojini says the traditional water-lifting system consumes more time, energy and manpower, so she incurred some losses due to this. She earns a monthly income of 4,000 INR from the above businesses. For future development of her family, Sarojini wants to expand her business by taking a fresh loan. With this loan, she has planned to buy fertilizer and farm inputs such as seeds and pesticides for her farm and purchase a diesel water pump for lifting water. By this, she can save the time and manpower and can utilize the same in other farm work. She expects a good return from this investment. \r\n\r\nSarojini dreams to construct a house and of the marriage of her son. \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are involved in businesses such as vegetable cultivation and vending, Castro oil selling, and puffed rice selling."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1656178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase seeds and pesticides for her farm and purchase a diesel water pump for lifting water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-08-02T00:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-01T00:00:12Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rekha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saebani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parbati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarojini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shrimati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gomati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhajikhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumititra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-31T22:33:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":745274,"name":"El Buen Sembrador - Cruz B1 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos Miguel tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, (aparece en la foto en la posici\u00f3n cuarto , de izquierda a derecha, viste sombrero, camisa de rayas de color celeste), vive en el municipio de Santa Luc\u00eda Utatl\u00e1n, departamento de Solol\u00e1, solicita nuevamente cr\u00e9dito porque el anterior le dejo muchos beneficios y asegur\u00f3 la alimentaci\u00f3n de su familia este a\u00f1o, y lo que no van a consumir lo sacar\u00e1 al mercado para obtener un ingreso m\u00e1s, el ma\u00edz es la base de la alimentaci\u00f3n de la familias por lo tanto tiene mucha demanda, antes de tener cr\u00e9dito Santos Miguel no pod\u00eda tener metas porque todo su capital lo invert\u00edan en el mantenimiento de ma\u00edz, Santos Miguel necesita nuevamente cr\u00e9dito para comprar insumos (abono qu\u00edmico)  para el mantenimiento de ma\u00edz, al obtener un compromiso por medio del cr\u00e9dito Santos Miguel se fue haci\u00e9ndose m\u00e1s responsable, y tambi\u00e9n le ayuda a obtener una buena cosecha, Santos Miguel tiene como meta construir dos cuatros m\u00e1s para su familia, y as\u00ed poder vivir en mejores condiciones.","en":"Santos Miguel, 51, (he appears in the photo fourth from the left wearing a hat and a shirt with blue stripes) lives in the municipality of Santa Lucia Utatl\u00e1n, Solol\u00e1 Department.

For the past 2 years, Zainah has been working hard to manage her canteen business, which sells snacks. \n\nTo help expand her business, Zainah has requested a loan of 950,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy flour to make more snacks, and will help Zainah to generate greater profits and develop the family well being. Zainah hopes that in the future she will be able to return to school. \n\nZainah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Fue entonces cuando decidi\u00f3 pedir un financiamiento a una instituci\u00f3n y emprender su propio negocio.

Por esta raz\u00f3n solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en productos como ma\u00edz, frijoles y az\u00facar, los cuales actualmente no tiene para ofrecer a sus clientes. Ella sabe que diversificando los productos podr\u00e1 crecer y poder darles a sus clientes una mejor atenci\u00f3n.

However she did  not have the money to carry them out. It was the time to pay the household expenses and for school and university for her 7 children who are aged from 7 to 22 years old. But the income of her husband who works as a bricklayer was not sufficient. It was then that she decided to request a loan from an institution and start her own business. <br \/><br \/>Now she is a 55 year old business woman who only studied up to Grade 1 due to a lack of financial resources. She has run her small grocery store for four years where she also sells fast food like tacos and enchiladas. <br \/><br \/>Juana has high expectations for her business and without doubt she will invest anything necessary to continue to grow. She also can count on the help of two of her daughters. So she is requesting a loan to purchase products like corn, beans and sugar which she presently does not offer her customers. She knows that diversifying her stock can help her grow and provide better service to her customers.

She serves breakfast (tea with bites) and lunch food such as rice, ugali (a hot, sticky dough made from rice flour) with beans, meat and vegetables. Working from 6 am to 6 pm daily she is able to make a small profit each month.\r\n\r\nThis is her twentieth loan via Tujijenge Tanzania Ltd. She used the previous loans, since repaid, to buy stocks of rice, beans, sugar, maize and baking flour. She received an extra income which she used to buy a plot of land and cover school fees and household expenses. She dreams that one day she will be able to build a house for her family. With her new request, Rose will use the loan money to buy food cooking ingredients for her new mama lishe (local restaurant or cafe).\r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group 'Neema Kimara' which totals two members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

When the opportunity came through Zoona she quickly took advantage of it. Access to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Zoona is a company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called Zoona agents. Kasongo is a Zoona agent.\r\n\r\nKasongo believes her community benefits from her business in a very positive way because the service she provides is faster compared to other money transfer services and more often has enough cash to pay out receiving customers. Kasongo is requesting for her first Kiva loan to purchase her trading booth outright, allowing her to own a portable storefront and be able to eliminate her current rental payments. \r\n\r\nKasongo has many dreams for her future, she hopes to take her children to good schools.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Isah is ambitious and is aiming to reap 35 per hectare this season. When asked, Isah said \u201cI plan to use the money I make to build a better home and in 5 years, I want to make more money for myself and my family.\u201d With this loan, he is well on his way to achieving this dream.

His sister is in college as well. His parents want all of their children to get an education for their future to be better. The provision of education is the only thing his parents can give, because his parents only work as casual laborers. Their income is uncertain, depending on the presence or absence of a project on which they can get work. Due to the condition of his parents, Katon is motivated to quickly complete college. Currently, Katon is registered as a prospective student at the Academy of Maritime Nusantara (AMN). He takes the program's management and harbor cruise commerce courses. Katon applied for a loan from Kiva to help ease the burden of his parents. Katon also hopes that with this loan, he can quickly get a job as a clerk at a port or shipping company.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1657313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay his education fees for three years","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2014-08-02T09:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-01T09:40:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katon Prasojo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2019-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-19T10:47:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":748654,"name":"Ishaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ishaya is a 40-year-old farmer from Galadima.
