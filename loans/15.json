SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":722819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his partner and they have four children. Together they live in the community of Villa Quintiarina, Kimbiri village district. \r\n\r\nFrom a young age Victor wanted to own land to farm, so as to be able to leave his job as laborer working in land owned by others. Thanks to the savings he accumulated over the years he was finally able to fulfill his dream, and he now owns 5 hectares where he grows cocoa and banana.

Twenty eight years ago he joined together with Bl\u00e1sida, now 45, with whom he has four children. Three of them are grown and the youngest still lives with them. Jose works slaughtering cattle, selling the meat in the butcher shop he runs in his home. At the same time he has a well-stocked store that he set up more than 25 years ago. His wife helps with the business. He says that he is from a humble family and with his father he previously worked making bricks. Thanks to their sacrifice he was able to put together a small capital to set up the store along with his wife. Thanks to this business he achieved economic stability and the possibility of moving forward with his entire family, and also being able to build his own home. Having access to credit, he would invest in the purchase of standing cattle to fatten up and later slaughter in order to sell the meat in his own butcher shop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Raimkul is from the town of Istaravshan. He is 39 years old, married and has four children. Raimkul has always lived in the agricultural region of Istaravshan where he owns a small land and for the last 4 years he has worked as a farmer. He learned this skill from his father. \r\n\r\nOn his land he cultivates potato, wheat and other vegetables together with the help of his elder sons. At the same time Raimkul uses his car to provide a taxi service, and also raises cattle. His car requires thorough repairs, which has prompted Ramikul to seek a second loan request through IMON International. This will allow him to purchase spare parts for his car, and earn more money to send his children to university.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Every year, the education of Hermenia's children incurs bigger financial expenses. Hermenia's business had been very helpful in supporting those expenses and has abled her children to continue their studies.\r\n\r\nIt has been thirty years that Hermenia is into her business buying and selling fish.

Despite financial struggles, Hermenia proved her trustworthiness and well-defined values by showing good performance in terms of her repayments, attendance and business.\r\n\r\nRecently, Hermenia, her husband and her children decided to apply for a loan in ASHI to enhance her business further and it could profit greatly. The whole family agreed on the idea of buying more variety of fish and to increase the volume of their purchases in order to sell more, cover a wider area of the municipality, and have bigger profits. Aside from intending Hermania's loan for her primary business, they also plan to enhance their hog-fattening business (backyard pig-raising to be sold after four months) for an alternative income during the off-season of fish.\r\n\r\nThrough the profit Hermenia's hog fattening business would generate, she aspires to purchase a motor fishing boat to be managed by her husband while her profit from buying and selling fish will be intended for her weekly repayments to ASHI, family daily needs, and her children's

During her membership, she was noted of being one of the most active and with exemplary performance in ASHI.<\/p>\r\n<p>Her previous loans were invested in her computer shop business. Every time she receives a loan, she put them in the shop as additional capital. Now on her 11th loan, she proposes a loan of 30,000 pesos as additional capital for her computer shop. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for 2 sets of brand new computer as additional units in her shop. She believes that her business will grow since the use of computer shops is in demand by students.<\/p>\r\n<p>Her dream in life is to expand her business and be able to purchase additional computers,

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have two young children who are 6 and 8 years old. Her highest aspiration for her family is that her children be able to go to school, earn their college degrees and have all the opportunities to attain a bright future for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nThis is what motivated Christine and her husband Benny to engage in their fish-vending business, selling fish to regular customers in their community and even further to the neighboring barangays and sugar plantations. Delivering the fish to their customers was made easy with the aid of their tricycle - a motorcycle with a sidecar attached that can carry the fish containers. They were quite happy with their achievements at that point but then, in 2004, they knew they had the opportunity to expand their business if only they had the necessary capital.\r\n\r\nChristine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the new capital she needed to expand the business. As she paid off each loan and borrowed a larger one that she could afford to pay back, Christine and her husband's business improved. Later, with the extra capital, she was able to put up a general store adjacent to her house to cash in on the income opportunity that it offered. The two businesses now earn an average monthly income of PHP 12,000.\r\n\r\nFor her previous, 11th, loan Christine borrowed PHP 29,500 that was used as additional capital for her business and this loan was fully paid on time without any delays in the weekly installments. For her 12th loan she proposed the same amount of PHP 29,500 to be used for her fish vending and general store businesses. The income from it will be used as savings for her two young children\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nIn the picture Christine is shown standing outside her store window while her two young children peek out from inside her general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":400812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

These beads are used at marriages and burial and naming ceremonies. Nigerians love traditional beads because they are an important part of their cultural heritage. Patricia is married, has three children and is 45 years old. She has been in her line of work for a long time and has applied for a loan for 100,000 NGN to buy more traditional beads to sell.

She is 49 years old. Betty is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is A.'s Group.\r\n\r\nBetty is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Betty owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Betty has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Betty joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Betty has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Betty is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Betty from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Rosalinda from HSPFI.

a widow in her early forties, lives with her 4-year-old orphaned niece and supports her teenage son who is currently attending boarding school.

Before this business, her income was dependent on selling clothes, but she found this business to be an unreliable source of income since her customers often did not pay her the full amount on the spot. As a result, she took out a loan and found the confidence in herself to start a new trade.\r\n<p>\r\nHalima\u2019s diner now makes a profit of around $20 a day. The diner holds about 10 customers at a time, but people can eat outside as well. As business is currently going well, and she was able to pay back her first loan successfully, her hope is to take out another loan in order to begin serving French fry dishes. Halima currently hires a helper for half the day and has plans to hire another helper to be in charge of cooking the French fries. She also has plans of setting up umbrella booths in front of her diner where people can eat them. \r\n<p>\r\nHalima belongs to the group Dhahabu (Swahili for \u201cgold\u201d), which consists of 36 other members who keep each other accountable and insure one another in paying back their loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":81969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To hire an additional helper and to set up outdoor umbrella booths for customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2007-11-08T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-22T17:23:05Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":112500},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":112500},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":112500},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":112500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":112500,"processed_date":"2007-12-22T10:19:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-08T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":114970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":101253},{"amount":100,"local_amount":112500,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-08T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":114970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120165},{"amount":100,"local_amount":112500,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-08T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":114970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140342},{"amount":100,"local_amount":112500,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T13:27:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-08T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":114970,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152450}],"funded_date":"2007-11-08T17:23:05Z","paid_date":"2008-03-07T13:27:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":27389,"name":"Saturday","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Saturday Ulehor is 32 years old, married and has one child.

The members are of the Saint Francisco of Campusano community in Nindiri. They are humble people but enterprising; they have the primary approval (for their loan) and that has let them be more expressive and more successful because they have lost their shyness. They owe this to Kiva partner ADIM, who has helped them. Their loans have been invested in the purchase of ingredients for baking bread, which is later sold by the dozen in stores. With the loans from ADIM, they have had the opportunity to improve the lives of their families. They have both invested their profits in their businesses as well as used them to fix up their homes. Carolina is a single mother. She sells cosmetics by order ** and has not had any sort of help from her children's father.

For the last two years she has worked selling essential products. In the beginning she rented a small storefront, but currently she works out of her own home where she serves customers all day and at the same time cares for her son.  Aydee is very careful about the amount and type of products she sells and, based on the demand, she buys merchandise wholesale. In the future her wish is to have a grocery store in an area that is more central and commercial than her current location to be able to increase her sales. It is her second loan with MFP and she is very thankful that her communal bank has taught her the solidarity that she now promotes among the people she meets.  The money that she is requesting is for the purchase of products wholesale such as rice, sugar, sweets and soft drinks. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":311322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-28T10:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2068.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733815}],"funded_date":"2009-04-28T13:31:02Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":109332,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace G. is 49 years old.

Her shop started as a hair salon. Rebecca employs two other people to wash, relax, and style hair. They also do manicures and pedicures. Many of her customers are her neighbors, but some people come from far away because they know of her work. One of the challenges of her business is that if customers don\u2019t have any income, they stop coming to her salon. Therefore, she decided to diversify her offerings and she began to sell other basic grocery items like sugar and onge out of the same shop.\r\n\r\nRebecca is a 30 years old, married, and the mother of three. Her children range from 3-10 years old. Her husband works casually and does not have a permanent job. Besides running this salon, Rebecca is a Community Healthcare Worker; a volunteer in her community. For two days each week she visits sick people in their homes, and counsels them and their caretakers.\r\n\r\nRebecca will use this loan to stock her shop; she will buy more of the products that she is running out of. Rebecca hopes that someday she will be able to grow her business into a large salon with many employees and workstations. Her biggest dream is to open a hairdressing school.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About K-MET:<\/b>\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional microfinance institution. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya. Many of the loan recipients from this organization are volunteer community healthcare workers like Rebecca.

He is domiciled in Banconi\u2013Koulikoro with his two wives and his children in a district of Sikasso City.  After having run many businesses without success, he got started in the business of storing and marketing grains (corn, millet, and sorghum) seven years ago.  He has a store in Kabo\u00efla I, opposite the Guinso Clinic. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying his burgeoning customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in 2009.  He has had an initial loan, which was properly repaid.  He is requesting a second loan to buy 28 sacks of corn, and 30 sacks of millet from towns surrounding Sikasso.  These goods are first stocked up in his store and are then resold in bulk to a customer base composed of retailers and heads-of-household.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he envisions making a monthly profit of 180,000 francs CFA.  The profits will be used essentially for helping to cover family expenses and to pay the loan interest.  The rest will be invested in his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying grains ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdramane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":220804,"name":"Rodelisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodelisa R. is from the village of Bantuanon, Lantapan, Bukidnon.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling wild-caught fish in the local community.  Anita is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Anita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Anita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell.  This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Anita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After graduating from the Kapan secondary school, he attended the Yerevan State University.  Arshavir's wife does not work and stays home with the children. Their son is two years old, and the daughter is four.  Arshavir's parents live together with them and help him with the farm.  Arshavir has been involved in agriculture in the Geganush village in the Syunik region since 2004.  With the help of his parents, he breeds cattle and chickens.  He also has a land plot, where he grows vegetables for sale.  Arshavir also sells beef, milk and eggs to his loyal customers in Kapan and, thus, supports his family.  This is his second loan from Nor Horizon, and this time he needs a loan in the sum of 450,000 in order to buy hay and medicine for his farm

Because she does all the salon work herself, Francisca has very little time to spend with her children. Luckily, her salon is in her own house.

They are on their second loan cycle with Esperanza International. Juana has two different businesses: selling clothes and selling gasoline. She sells the clothes in her home, and she sells the gasoline on the road close to her house. The community roads are often small and it's hard to find gas stations, so it's easy for her to sell small quantities to the motorcycle drivers.

He lives in his own house made of adobe, together with his wife Micaela, who is 19 years old, and his beloved son Ton, who is 1, and to whom he wishes to give a good future.\r\n<p>\r\nHis days as a brick-maker are very long and hard.  He wakes up at 6 o'clock in the morning to mix and mold the bricks, which he will then put in his oven to bake, and then they will be ready to sell.  The orders that he has are generally very large, and so therefore he requests help from his neighbors, who are also brick-makers, in order to complete the requests, with the promise to help them when they need his help.  What he likes most about his work is making the bricks, since he feels like he is playing with the clay and its not like work.  He has been doing this work for 5 years and he considers the most difficult part putting the bricks in the oven, since he has to put them in a way that they all cook evenly.  For the future, he hopes that his business progresses and that he is able to improve his income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Elmer's fourth loan with MFP and he doesn't want to miss any payments for lack of money, so he is already making contacts to sell his bricks.  He is the only young man in his community bank, so therefore he always tries to be responsible and respectful of his female colleagues.

Everyday from 5:30am, their two young helpers and their two youngest children go around delivering bread to neighbourhood stores and homes. Then their two children set off for school. Gregoria also sells bread in the mornings from the corner near her house.\r\n\r\nShe has worked in the past with Kiva and is very grateful to the staff who assisted her with the business which finally began to do well and she was able to hire two young people to help out.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling salted peanuts and selling frozen foods. Her husband Wilmer, who is 38 years old, works as an administrator of a fishing boat to earn his living. They have four children who are between 2 and 12 years old. Dareen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Dareen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional capital to save up for the future education of her children and to build their own house. Dareen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The members named it after their village.  The 'Tututepec San Pedro' group has twelve members.  The group's representative is Alma Eva who owns a grocery store.  This group is located in the town of San Pedro, in the State of Oaxaca.\r\n\r\nClaudia is 39 years old and studied up to the fifth grade of elementary school.  She has three children: two daughters and one son.  Her business is selling groceries and also selling chicken.  She needs this loan to buy more chickens since she will use the profits to set up a chicken store.\r\n\r\nClaudia started her chicken business three years ago, before she set up her grocery store.  Her customers are loyal to her business because she sells very well.  In addition, she sells on credit and when her customers get paid, they pay her.  It is a way of helping her customers.\r\n\r\nWhat Claudia would like to gain from this loan is a large chicken store so that she can make more profits and thereby help her children to finish their studies.  She would also like to be able to enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other ten members of this group are:\r\n\r\nCristina \u2013 who will buy threads for making tablecloths and napkins\r\nEnma

She lives with her partner and their 3 children in their own house, a building bought with hardwork and sacrifice. Jessi sells used clothing. She buys bundles (large bags) of used clothes in the city from which she selects according to functionality and use. Once she has separated the clothes, she goes in search of buyers who are mostly the residents of the villages and towns near the city. She has been doing this work alone for a year. What she likes about the work is that she invests little and makes a good percentage in profit. In addition, it allows her to spend almost every day with her children as she only travels 2 days a week and on those days she makes enough sales for the whole week.

Djumakan grew up in a big family with three brothers and two sisters. Her parents were ordinary workers. After graduating from high school, Djumakan helped the family on the farm and since childhood she has had tremendous experience working with domestic livestock and crops. The family's main source of income was growing beets, and there was no question of her having access to higher education. She married a fellow villager, and the young family began working in the fields, planting beets. \r\n\r\nLiving in her home village became harder and harder.  There was no work--all of them men could only work farming poultry and sugar beets, and by the time Djumakan started raising children there was not enough land for all of the families in the village.  One day, she and her husband asked Djumakan's parents for one of their three milk cows. That became the beginning of the family's livestock business. \r\n\r\nSince they had a cow, the family began to receive milk.  Djumakan's husband got a job as a shepherd.  The young family with two young children lived in a small room, which had been allocated to them by the collective farm. For five years, they worked hard and saved money to buy a house with a small outhouse. Djumakan and her husband raised two wonderful children, married them off, and become grandparents. \r\n\r\nDjumakan's children left to work in Russia and left her to raise her three grandchildren, aged one and a half, two, and three years old. Today, in order to feed their family, Djumakan keeps two dairy cows and receives about 3,000 som a month from the milk, plus her monthly pension of 2,500 som. This pays for the children's expenses.

Dengan bertambahnya modal, Sri Rahayu mampu meningkatkan keuntungannya menjadi Rp. 50.000.-"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":68908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To add merchandise such as various snacks and soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-26T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sri Rahayu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T15:34:02Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T04:51:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-20T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65675},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:38:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-20T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86602},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:42:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-20T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100263},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:17:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-20T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119063},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-20T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138524}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T15:34:02Z","paid_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23325,"name":"Vina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. N.

They live in Ciudadela Metropolitana, a neighborhood located in Soledad \u2013Atl\u00e1ntico.\r\n\r\nNancy wanted to feel independent and she started her own business.

Together they have obtained contracts with businesses, educational centers, and contruction which is their main market. They haven't left the individual jobs behind that they do with family, neighbors, and people who know the quality of their work in their workshop.  \r\n\r\nThey still remember when they started with one welding machine making small metalic boxes to protect natural gas meters. For a time it was the only thing they made in their workshop. Gradually, they added other products such as bars, chairs, windows, doors and antennas. This is the second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. They need  $ 2.000.000  to purchase materials such as tubes, irons, paint, soldering, and to make skeletons of spinning chairs and doors ordered by an educational organization with which they regularly do business. Their blacksmith and ornamentation workshop has allowed them to purcahse their house and outfit their workshop in a spacious room which improved their infrastructure in a short time. Competence is a challenge and that is why they always listen to the client and they try to participate in training activities to improve the quality at a management and technical level.     \r\n

She is 28 years old. Jamebie is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Jamebie owns and operates a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from serving and selling breads with coffee, chocolate drinks and teas in the local community. Jamebie has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jamebie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jamebie is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jamebie from HSPFI.

This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy more fish to sell in the market so that she can continue to save up for her children's education & household improvements.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! Pictured here is 26 year-old Rose L. from Mwanza. She is married with one four year-old child.\r\n \r\nRose has been running a small shop since 2005. She sells a number of common household and grocery items such as soda, water, sugar, soaps, tealeaves, eggs, maize flours, wheat flours and fitness books. She works at the business for 13 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by her husband. \r\n\r\nRose currently earns about 200 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to buy additional stocks of soda, sugar, wheat flours and fitness books. In the future, she plans to increase the stocks of her business. Rose thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional stocks of soda, sugar, wheat flours and fitness books","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130781},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027570},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613571},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010650},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":104800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232936}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T04:40:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Chang","image":null}},{"id":92996,"name":"Adwoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adwoa K. is 46 years old.

He lives in his own home with his wife Rosa, 29, and their 2 young children, who are the motivation behind all of his work. In all his life, Jorge has never avoided work; since a very young age he worked in various jobs. He now owns fields, which provide him the income he needs to maintain his family. He also works in the municipality of the San Juan community. With this new income he has been able to open a small store, which he has kept stocked; so it is very popular with the neighbours. Of all of his jobs, he most likes working in his store, since he benefits greatly from offering good service to his customers, despite the long hours he has to spend in the store. But this does not bother him; it's all about progressing in life.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
