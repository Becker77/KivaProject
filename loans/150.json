They visit herders in the countryside with their truck and purchase livestock at a discount when they can. Once they bring the livestock home, they slaughter them and prepare them for sale. Once the meat is ready for the market, they sell it to wholesale middlemen from their town and Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. In the future, they would like to create their own channel to bring livestock to the town without visiting each herder in the countryside. They request a loan to purchase livestock from herders.\r\n

She is a single mother with two grown-up children who help her out financially. Her daughter, who lives in the United States, helps her out with $200.00. She also gets financial support from her son. However, Elsa has always been a very hardworking woman who struggled to help her family get ahead on her own for many years, and she is not thinking about stopping now. For this reason, she started selling perfume, body lotions, and other cosmetics 5 years ago, and she has had success in sales.

M. is 26 and married with 2 children (ages 1 and 3).  She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Vitolio has many years of experience in this business.  Vitolio needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vitolio joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vitolio's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vitolio M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Juliet was like any other na\u00efve business upstart. Being in two minds did not help either, as she was on the one hand being dissuaded from trying her hand at any other business, whilst her close consorts were constantly prevailing upon her to start a retail shop.\r\n\r\nWith huge reserves of courage and conviction in tow, Juliet, in the midst of all this, made up her mind to start a retail shop in Buwenge, Jinja. She decided to dispense with the soft drink business she had all along banked on as her main source of livelihood.\r\n\r\nJuliet\u2019s hard work ethic spawned an unprecedented growth in her business profits.

She is 49 years old, married, and has six adult children. To make a living, Julita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Julita has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Julita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to expand the business. Julita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Julita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":621223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Instead, she wishes that it would grow and can be inherited by her children.

For 7 years she has sold food, which will now be her source of income that will help with the household expenses.  In addition, she likes to cook very much and this gives her an advantage because she is a good cook; this has brought a lot of demand for the dishes that she prepares. Having learned this activity from the time she was very small, since her mother taught her all of her culinary secrets, she has built a steady job from this, rising early in the morning to prepare her stews and finishing later to take them to sell in the busiest markets in her area.  In this way the business is very profitable, so she hopes to continue to thrive, little by little.  In addition, she really enjoys the work.  Carmen and her partner have many plans in mind, and hope to put them into action and for this reason they need a loan to invest in the business.  This is her eighteenth loan with MFP; she belongs to a very solid group, which helps her to accomplish her goals since all of the members of the group are very good about making their payments.  With the loan that she requests, she will invest in the purchase of ingredients to prepare her dishes, because she comes out ahead if she can buy at wholesale.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":459623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more ingredients to prepare food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-28T20:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":146.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":154.65},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":170.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":185.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.31},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.21,"local_amount":146.31,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":147.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124396},{"amount":54.13,"local_amount":154.65,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":155.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960137},{"amount":57.76,"local_amount":165.05,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":166.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992981},{"amount":59.62,"local_amount":170.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":171.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717767},{"amount":62.31,"local_amount":178.01,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":179.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751443},{"amount":64.97,"local_amount":185.64,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":187.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933892}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T01:33:23Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":169727,"name":"Marvin German","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marvin tiene 39 a\u00f1os, este no es el primer financiamiento que el realiza, por lo que ha sido una gran experiencia.

She owns a business venture, selling clay handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Sareta has many years of experience in this business.  Sareta needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sareta joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sareta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sareta S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

He has owned a grocery store since 2005. He sells canned food, candies, drinks, eggs, bread, etc.  A feature of Mouhamad's work is that he knows how to treat his clients. His clients are his friends and neighbors. \r\n\r\n<p>He has requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for his store. This is the first time that Mouhamad has requested a loan. When he first started his business, he dealt with some financial issues, as well as having to face the competition. He decided on setting up his business because he wanted to have independent work, as well as gaining experience. In the future, he plans to expand his business by opening a second grocery store.

She knits chambritas (small wool sweaters) and baby clothes.  She has been in this work for more than 6 years.  In these last two years, she has been occupied more at home, as she has an ill mother, and in this way attends to her with the care needed.  Iris makes garments by hand and by machine.  When she has many orders, her sisters help her.  She puts her work in the stores on Calle 21 of San Miguel, in particular in the bookstore that her sister has.  She lives in the area of Irpavi, where military families generally live.  It is a warm and laid-back area.  She does not yet have her own family.  She lives in the home of her parents together with her three siblings. However, everyone has their own activities and independence, sharing the family expenses among themselves.  Finally, we can say that she is a responsible person, previously was also a cliente of Kiva, and did not have setbacks in her payments.  With the loan money, she will buy wool for the knitting she does.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It is located in the community of Cruce de Vega in the district of Tambogrande. It is about 40 minutes from the department of Piura. The primary businesses in each of these regions are agriculture, farming, and tourism.\r\n\r\nGenoveva raises and sells livestock (poultry, turkeys, and sheep). The corral where she keeps them is located outside her house and she feeds them a balanced diet and natural grasses. She sells her livestock once they have reached an ideal size and weight at the different markets in the city of Piura.

The funds will be used to purchase balanced feed and to install another corral. Her livestock has increased in number and she needs it to raise them more comfortably. The goal is to fatten them before their sale to acquire a good price at the market. This will help her repay her loan and it will help her improve the quality of life for her family. \r\n\r\nGenoveva is a very hard working and earnest woman who has always known to move forward and to improve in life, and to offer her children something better."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":767334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase balanced feed for her livestock and to install another corral.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -

Abandoned and on her own, she has many difficulties to overcome and much to finance: food, rent, her child\\'s education, clothing, etc. \r\n\r\nBorn in 1974, she successfully completed her secondary education. She had her first professional experience in a private school. As a misfortune never happens alone, she had to put an end to that activity of teaching as her already low salary was not even paid to her.\r\n\r\nVery bewildered but keeping her courage, as she has nobody to help her, she has undertook the trade of sweets,  biscuits and chocolates with $35 which she had at her disposal.  After that she received a credit of $100 she repaid. Her second credit of $200 allowed her to expand her activities to shoes and beauty products, which could bring her more income if she has possessed a more consistent working fund. \r\n\r\nCurrently, at the coming of the year end feasts, she needs $550 to buy articles, namely: womens shoes and beauty products.  This will help her to grow her income and to improve her own living condition and that of her children.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMlle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne K. est une jeune femme tr\u00e8s dynamique et m\u00e8re d\u2019une fille dont le P\u00e8re est introuvable depuis trois ans.

Elle a eu ses premi\u00e8res exp\u00e9riences professionnelles dans une \u00e9cole priv\u00e9e. Comme un malheur n\u2019arrive jamais seul, elle a d\u00fb mettre fin \u00e0 cette activit\u00e9 d\u2019enseignante qui tourne \u00e0 la m\u00e9saventure car le maigre salaire aussi ne se payait pas. \r\nTr\u00e8s d\u00e9sempar\u00e9e mais gardant son courage car n\u2019ayant personne \u00e0 lui venir en aide, elle a entrepris le commerce de bonbons , biscuits a chocolats avec $ 35 qu\u2019elle disposait. Par la suite elle a obtenu un cr\u00e9dit de $ 100 qu\u2019elle avait bien rembours\u00e9.

old. Daniel operates a small shop, a business that he has had for 12 years. He started the business with capital he had raised through farming sweet potatoes on his small piece of land. He and his family are totally dependent on this business for their needs and so far he has not had a challenge.\r\n\r\nDaniel was introduced to KADET Limited by a friend who was an existing client.

He is single and lives in his uncle Felix\u2019s house; his uncle has a daughter.  His uncle is a living example of someone who sacrifices himself for, and is dedicated to, his native soil.  He learned all he knows about farming from him from a very early age.  This is why he so enjoys farming his lands.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that he has farmed for the last 20 years and, with help from his younger siblings and some hired help, he cares for corn, pea and potato crops.  The sale of these products is quite profitable and provides enough income to cover family expenses so that they can meet all their basic needs.\r\n\r\nHe would like to plant more in the future because he\u2019d like to become a wholesaler of all the products he grows as well as of all products typical of the \r\nPeruvian mountains; he is trying to become associated with a wholesaler in the capital\u2019s market.\r\n\r\nThis is his 9th loan with MFP; he enjoys working in a communal group because he likes to share new experiences with his fellow members.  He wants to continue to progress together with them.\r\n\r\nHe will use the 2800 new soles requested to buy two sacks of pea seed and five sacks of fertilizer.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":510188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" To buy pea seed and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freol","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2862,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153920}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T16:42:39Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":190798,"name":"Yrma Yuliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Sampaguita, Brgy. Su-ay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: general store, buy and sell (charcoal) and hog fattening businesses. Her husband, Luis, who is 50 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have nine children who are between 11 and 28 years old. \r\n\r\nJoelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1989 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store and for food for her hogs so she can continue to save up for her children's future education and for house renovation. Joelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Camba-og, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a pottery business.  Her husband Joeffrey, who is 36 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 5 and 13 years old. \r\n\r\nAnnaliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past twelve loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annaliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children. \r\n\r\nAnnaliza T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":33484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invertir en arroz en su finca\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-01T19:42:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonidas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-16T15:56:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-06-14T22:55:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23073},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-07-19T20:33:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33681},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:29:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71896},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:25:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107740},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T10:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134851}],"funded_date":"2007-05-02T15:56:08Z","paid_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13787,"name":"Ry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ry P. is a 36-year-old housewife who takes care of her husband and 6 children in Siem Reap.

He was born in Namaacha, in a district on the border of Swaziland.  He studied through tenth grade, then had to stop because work did not allow him to continue attending school.  <P>\r\n\r\nHe left his parents\u2019 house when his oldest sister got a house and asked him to take care of it.  Because he did not work at that time, his sister gave him a monthly allowance of 250 meticais (MZN).  He grew more responsible and always wanted to be independent, so he secured a job at a small restaurant, where he worked for three years.  His sister found him a better position at the Libombos Hotel, in the department where she was an accountant.  It required, however, an education through at least tenth grade, and he had studied through only eighth grade at that time.  So he asked his boss if he could continue his studies, and his boss denied his request, arguing that the job he was doing did not allow him to study.  In 2000 Clemencio left that job and resumed his studies.  Completing tenth grade, in 2003 he began to work as a receptionist, which he continues today.  He is a regular employee, works from 7am to 7pm, and makes 4,000MZN per month.  He has taken responsibility for his twin sister and his nephews and nieces, buying them uniforms and their necessary school materials.  He manages to save 1,000MZN per month, as he does not have children and lives with his girlfriend.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Clemencio\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner) and his first with Kiva.  He used the first loan of 20,000MZN to buy construction materials for his house, and he repaid the loan on time.  He requests this second loan of 20,000MZN to finish this work.  His goal is to see this building completed and to request a new loan to furnish it.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All of her children are now grown. She lives with her husband Leonisio in a small house in Bagong Silang, Caloocan City.\r\n<p>\r\nFive years ago Josefina built a general store off of their home. An offshoot of her retail business is her sale of cosmetics and apparel through popular direct sales programs such as Personal Collection, Avon, Sarah Lee, etc. Josefina also cooks and sells a popular streetside snack among Filipinos called banana-cue, a caramelized banana on a thin bamboo skewer. She earns at least 9000 PHP a month from these combined business activities.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has been with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) credit cooperative for a year now. Now on her third loan cycle, she is requesting a 8000 PHP loan with the cooperative to purchase more cosmetics for her clients. She will also use a portion of the loan to buy bananas in bulk. Josefina has saved much of her earnings and is looking forward to having their house renovated soon.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout CCT:\r\n<p>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

She lives in a rented house, and what she wants the most is to succeed in life.  Her business is selling coca leaves.  It has been very profitable, and it has given her the necessary income to support herself on her own.  She purchases the coca leaves wholesale because it is cheaper this way and then sells it at a small stand in the door of the house where she lives.  What she likes most about her job is that it gives her time to dedicate to her studies.  She has had this business for 4 years and she thinks the most difficult part is staying all day at her sales stand because it's very stressful for her.

He is married to Zaida, who is 24, and together they have a child. The family lives with Erik's parents in their house. Erik's little daughter is the one who keeps him going, she is his greatest motivation. Beginning at 5 in the morning, Erik works raising potatoes, corn and other vegetables. He is helped by his wife and some other workers who help till the soil and care for the plants. \r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of Erik's work is having to water the fields at night, and having no time to rest. He is compensated, however, by the income that he brings in from the sale of the vegetables he harvests. Thanks to this income he was able to buy furniture for his house and was able to buy another plot of land, in order to gain yet more income. Erik and his wife plan to buy a house with a large amount of land for growing food, and also a truck to take their products to the markets in their city. \r\n\r\nThis is Erik's third loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner], and he hopes to use it to improve his ventures in agriculture and his finances. He also wants to keep working with his communal bank, because the other group members are on time in their payments. With the 1000 Peruvian Soles he is asking for, he will buy many bags of fertilizer and a container of cabbage seeds. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":510225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cabbage seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erik ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153921}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T03:07:12Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

Umaru has been involved in a timber sales business for the past 3 years in Kijwiga-Kyenjojo. He says he began this business out of personal interest. This fledgling business has been making progressive strides over the past few years. He has been running the business on the basis of his tenacity, hardwork and enterprising spirit. Umaru, who is happily married and has 8 kids, also has a cattle sales business on the side. Weekly this business generates him shillings 20,000.

She shares two rooms with her children in Ntasen, a quarter in Bamenda, Northwest Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nStella has faced difficulties in her life, ranging from inability to meet her daily needs, increasing demands of her children, and the operation she had before their birth. Among other challenges, she also has had the difficulty of inadequate capital to expand her business. With this loan, she plans to buy more materials, buttons, thread and other materials for sewing dresses. She thinks her business will succeed because her business site is close to the road and she is friendly.  Thus she has many clients. Her activity will help her community by providing clothing close to home so that they won't have transportation costs and won't have to sew their own dresses.  Their cordial relationship will allow room for negotiations.\r\n\r\nShe will use a fraction of her profit to provide for the children\u2019s school needs and meet her personal needs. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up and moral support given her by the GHAPE office, and the low interest rate and the installment method of paying back a loan.\r\nABOUT GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":747878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Norma is a kind and very helpful person.  She lives in Las Brisas neighborhood, in the town of Silca.  Her business is selling sweet treats.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Norma received her high school diploma and, as she couldn't find work, she decided to start selling sweet treats as her mother taught her how to cook very well.  She starts serving her customers at 6.00pm and finishes at 9.00pm.  On weekends she finishes a little later.  While she is serving in her business, she helps take care of her two young children.  Her biggest challenge was to find an institution who would support her with a loan to invest in her business.  Owing to her age and her low credit rating, no institution would give her a loan until FAMA believed in her and in the potential of her business.\r\n\r\nNorma needs the loan that she has requested to buy meat, vegetables, flour, sauces, seasonings, soft drinks, beans and other products.  With the support of this loan, she will be able to satisfy demand for her sweet treats and this will make her more profits.\r\n\r\nNorma's goal is to set up a small caf\u00e9 because she currently sells her products in front of her home.

So from her young days she began to work at earning money alongside her parents. She sold juice for her mother who had a refrigerator. After some years of such apprenticeship with her mother, she gained a lot of rich experience. She decided to go out on her own, selling clothing and shoes for 10 years now. She has a good reputation where she lives and in many other places around town. Women come constantly to buy her goods in her home. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the intention of adding to her working capital, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been working with us for 36 months. After 4 solidarity loans and 1 individual loan, all correctly reimbursed, she is on her second individual loan. She expects to use this loan to buy 10 embroidered outfits and several pairs of shoes in Burkino Faso. <P>\r\n\r\nMrs. Massitan H. sells for cash or credit to a clientele composed of men and women. With this loan she hopes to make a monthly profit of 40,000 F CFA which will allow her to cover many family expenses (food and clothing). Her ambition is to build a house to live in. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Since Jorge receives a small pension from his former job, he now helps Florenda in her food-vending business so that they can earn a little more.\r\n\r\nThe couple have five children who are 34 to 43 years old, and have finished their training in their chosen fields: one is an electrician, another graduated from a nautical course, another finished a nursing course, and one is a midwife. One of her children works abroad and sends some money to help support the family; all the others are also gainfully employed and also help their parents in one way or another.\r\n\r\nBut Florenda and her husband Jorge do not want to be a financial burden to their children and want to retain some sort of independence. This is why they are striving hard to make their business a success in spite of their advanced age. Having a business also keeps them busy and alert.\r\n\r\nYears ago, Florenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access capital so that she could help her husband increase the family income, especially so that they could afford the school tuition of their children. When she got her first loan of Php 5,000, she invested it by putting up a general store. As she was able to increase her loan amounts at each new cycle, she also expanded the operations of her general store and widened the line of products she offered to her customers. To earn a large amount, enough to pay for tuition fees, she also engaged in hog-raising and sold the pigs just in time to pay for the college tuition of her children.\r\n\r\nPatience, hard work and dedication to achieve her dreams is the key to Florenda\u2019s success, success in the sense that all of her children were able to finish college and earn their degrees. Now that her children are already gainfully employed and are starting to help her financially, she is taking things a little bit easier and is concentrating more on food-vending, selling sweet potato, cassava, bananas, bread and hotdogs from her home. She earns a monthly income of PHP 4,000 from this business activity.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Florenda borrowed Php 16,000 as additional working capital for her business, and her loan was fully paid on time and in full, without any delays. Now, for her 11th loan, she is to borrowing Php 18,000 to be used to purchase ingredients for her food-vending business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

They are also proud because they do marvelous things with their money, making it return 100% profit in their respective businesses.\r\n\r\nThis group is located in Puebla, Mexico and is made up of ten achieving women, each having her own successful business.  This is their fourth cycle working with CreditComun and they have always been punctual with their payments.  They will use the money from this loan to buy supplies (fabric for making stuffed animals, different sizes of artificial eyes, thread, and stuffing).\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s treasurer is named Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Nieves A.L. and she is the group\u2019s most honest and responsible person.  This is why she was elected to this position among the other officers.  She is 45 years old, has a junior high school education, is single, and makes and sells stuffed animals.  She is a very enterprising woman and designs her own items.  Her peers see her as a person to be emulated, despite her limited formal education.  With a lot of effort she\u2019s been able to establish a large number of customers.\r\n\r\nFor her, success would mean opening her own stuffed animal factory and creating her own brand.  She also dreams of becoming known throughout the world and exporting her products.  Her goal in life is to create jobs for other women, who, like her, dream of providing good educations for their families, so that they don\u2019t suffer from the same needs that they have had to deal with.  These loans have made it possible for each of them establish their small businesses.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nGabriela A. L. \u2013 Cosmetic sales\r\nJosefdina G.

She lives in her own house with her husband Alfonso, who is 42 and works in a mine near the city of Huancayo, and their three children, to whom she wants to give a good education. Every day, very early in the morning, Clarinda goes out to work in her fields. For her, there are no days of rest, since she has to work continually on her farm to have good production. Her principal crops are potatoes, corn, peas, and gladiolas, which she sells wholesale in the city of Tarma. The freedom that she has working in her fields is what she likes most about her work, since she can freely enjoy the green fields. She has been doing this work for 25 years and finds that the most difficult part is protecting  her crops from the pests that can afflict them.

Each one of the members makes a living in different commercial activities, such as selling food, cosmetics, groceries at neighborhood stores, rice, jewelry, as well as offering hair-cutting, carpentry and laundry services. The members are aware that what really separates one business from another is its treatment of its customers, and it's for this reason they don't have too much competition. The loan will be used to acquire merchandise, ingredients and tools that will help the members generate more income to be able to give their families a better quality of life.
