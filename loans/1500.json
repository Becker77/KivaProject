Meet Salina who is 59 years old, and is very hardworking, honest and humble. She hails from Eldoret, Kenya - an area that is blessed with elite and world renowned runners, and also the best weather patterns that favor farming activities. Salina is a proud mother of seven children that she really loves and adores and will do anything in her power to always give them the best. Salina has been farming for the past 29 years and through these years she has always provided them with all the basic needs that they require.\r\n\r\nSalina practices mixed farming - that is crop and animal farming, and through these two she has been able to support her family, but she still faces challenges, which is why she wants to diversify and start poultry farming so that she can make ends meet. She is seeking a loan to buy poultry and she believes that through the increased income she will be able to comfortably take care of her family and assure her grandchildren of a secure future.\r\n\r\nSalina has experienced difficulties in acquiring funds to start her poultry business but she now feels relieved knowing that Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and other lenders to support aspiring women like her to be economically empowered and be able to realize their dreams. Because of the many years that Salina has had in farming she has learned the culture of saving and being honest with money, and she hopes through the loan she will be able to save more and repay the loan on time.\r\n\r\nShe believes that the loan will assist her to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her grandchildren.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1657992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-02T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-01T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2221.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2304.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2343.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2425.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2472.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2538.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2643.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2678.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2758.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2825.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2903.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.86,"local_amount":5130.77,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5252.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054403},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":2486.79,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2545.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547590},{"amount":35.06,"local_amount":3005.49,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3076.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680583},{"amount":34.65,"local_amount":2970.16,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3040.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624860},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":2786.51,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2852.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193933},{"amount":103.04,"local_amount":8832.05,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":9041.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264006},{"amount":53.07,"local_amount":4788.23,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4901.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.8,"payment_id":681376994}],"funded_date":"2014-08-11T14:27:17Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":745761,"name":"Batchimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batchimeg, aged 35, lives with her husband and two children in Darkhan, the second largest city of Mongolia.

He has been facing a challenge of transporting his produce to the market and the timely delivery of products. Lawrence sells perishable products such as milk and vegetables and he does not have proper storage facilities, therefore he needs to make sure that they reach the market on time. Because of poor feeder roads and the transport network in his area, he has faced a challenge, that is why he is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him in transporting his products to the market.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Lawrence will be able to timely deliver his products, and he will earn more profits because he will be selling his products at a high cost because they are still fresh.\r\n\r\nLawrence's dream is to be able to secure the future of his two children and to be able to improve his living conditions.

Meet Mercy, a 25-year-old caring, honest and very hard-working mother of one child, who hails from Eldoret, the area of Kenya that is home to all the elite runners in long-distance races. Mercy is a very hard-working farmer who is easy to get along with. She has been practising farming for the past four years during which she has never looked back because she has been making good profits and taking great strides in terms of farming.\r\n \r\nMercy practises mixed farming, that is, crop and dairy farming and through these ventures she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. She is  an early riser who wakes up very early to go to her farm because farming is the only way that she can earn a living.\r\n\r\nMercy has identified space on her farm that she wants to fully utilise through dairy farming. This is why she is kindly requesting a loan to buy a dairy cow. Eldoret is an area that has a high population and a high demand for milk: Mercy, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that and be able to earn extra income. She hopes that the extra income that she earns through this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and expand her milk-selling business.\r\n\r\nThrough the accumulated profits, Mercy is planning that she will be able to open a very large milk-selling business in the nearby shopping centre and also to package milk ready for selling. She wants to be economically empowered but, being a woman, she knows that accessing funds is challenging. However, knowing that there are partners such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, she feels relieved and knows that all her dreams will be achieved and she will be able to provide a secure future  for her child and also improve her family's living conditions. Mercy patiently awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1657972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

When asked, Mika said \u201cI plan to use the money I make to educate my children; Jibo, Inusa,  and  Asabe, and in 5 years, I want to become the most profitable farmer in my community\u201d. With this loan, he is well on his way to achieving this dream.

He finishes work at noon and receives help from one of his sons.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to build a septic tank and buy bags of manure for his cornfield.\r\n\r\nEsteban's dreams are to have grazing and dairy cows so that, in his old age, he can work less and have enough money to support his wife.

He never attended school because he comes from a poor family.  His wife helps him with his work. They have two school-aged children so Nelson has three dependents.\r\n\r\nHe is a farmer and also raises beef cattle, work he's been doing ever since he was a child. He learned about farming from his parents, and his wife helps him with everything.

Her husband is a farmer in the remote town of La Ceiba Chachi.  Her children regularly attend classes.  Maria owns a small wooden house that has a thatched roof, which is native to the community.  <br \/><br \/>Her family is poor and has limited resources.  They live in a small town that only has one school and a chapel.  The town does not receive basic services, such as running water, and transportation services are limited throughout the community.  This is the second loan she has received from FODEMI.  Maria continues to raise chickens since has obtained positive results that have helped her to cover household expenses.  In addition, part of the loan will be used to buy \u201cboroj\u00f3\u201d (a local exotic fruit that has considerable value).  <br \/><br \/>In the near future, Maria hopes to grow her business of selling \u201cboroj\u00f3\u201d and deliver those products to wholesale buyers.  She has more chickens and sells them on a weekly basis in San Lorenzo and the neighboring communities.  <br \/><br \/>Additional Information:<br \/>This is the second loan that has been issued to the group \u201cLa Ceiba\u201d.

She has a high school education and works as a schoolteacher. Since 1988, she has also worked in agriculture, specifically growing crops and animal husbandry. She is a very kind and responsible woman, very social and hardworking. She has four milking cows with calves, and her fresh milk and dairy products are in great demand among local residents to whom she sells them. Gulzhamal and her children also grow cotton on 0.8 hectares of their own land and sell it to wholesale buyers. Her total family income is about 20,000 KGS a month. Her customer base increases every day and therefore Gulzhamal has decided to develop her business.

Isiyaku joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his  children: Shedrak, Salomi, and  Christopah. Isiyaku is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. For the first time, Isiyaku will have access to quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed. Without this loan, he would be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive but are often diluted with external products such as sand.

Without this loan, he would be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive but are often diluted with external products such as sand.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Shafiu is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least  120 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Shafiu is hopeful about what the future holds; he  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, he will finally be able to afford to educate his children Basiru and Inusa.
