The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags of maize\/hectare, double the national average of 14. However, Dantine, is ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 40 bags per hectare this season.

Their daughter has a position of senior designer at a building company. He is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to buy building materials such as planks, cement, bricks and steel for his house renovation. Over the years, his house has deteriorated badly due to heavy rainfall and strong wind. After renovation, his family will live in a comfortable and warm place where less coal is burned and then less pollutants are released into the air. The borrower is very concerned about air pollution and he urges other households to renovate their houses and burn less coal as the state research department consider coal burning as the main air pollution contributor.

He has been rendering a taxi service to local people for more than ten years. His wife works at a hospital as a doctor. Their son recently graduated from his university and now he is looking for a job. As a national holiday named Naadam festival is happening across Kherlen, he wants to open temporary cafe which will mainly sell khuushuur, a national food, to local people. So he is requesting a loan of 2,400,000 MNT to buy beef and flour as well as pay rent for a cafe. The festival will continue for two weeks and if his business succeeds, he can accumulate significant income for his family needs. The borrower wants to use this income for his house renovations as his old brick house has deteriorated over the years.

","en":"Ulugbuhan is 62 years old, a widow and a heroine-mother: she has 7 children. She has a secondary education. She has practiced livestock breeding and crop farming since childhood. All of her children are grown up and live separately, but they still actively help their mother. Ulugbuhan currently has 2 cows and 3 sheep on her farm, as well as a 0.45 hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes, corn and cabbage. Her average monthly income is 4,000 som (KGS). As this amount of money is not enough to live on, Ulugbuhan's youngest son, who works in Russia, sends money home to help his mother. However, Ulugbuhan wants to run her business herself, be independent and, conversely, help her children. This is why Ulugbuhan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" to further develop her farm. She is requesting a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to increase the size of her herd with the goal of later reselling the livestock. She will also spend a portion of the loan on crop farming. The earnings from her business will improve Ulugbuhan's quality of life and also allow her to carryout a long-planned renovation of her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1663496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

Jeremiah has been doing farming for the past seven years, and through those years, he has gathered so much experience. Through the profits he has been getting, he has been able to earn a decent income.\r\n\r\nJeremiah loves dairy farming a lot, and he has even nicknamed his dairy cow \u201cKamwana,\u201d which means \"my baby,\" and that\u2019s what the cow means to him.\r\n \r\nAlthough Jeremiah has been making profits, he has been experiencing challenges of crop diseases; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy pesticides. Through the loan, Jeremiah is sure that he will have a bumper harvest, and the profits from selling the farm produce will permanently change his life, and he will be able to secure the future of his child.\r\n\r\nJeremiah intends to not only increase his farming, but also through the loan, he will be able to buy more land and start practicing large-scale farming\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1659602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-04T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-03T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":713.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":741.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":753.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":773.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":812.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":816.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":842.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":860.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":887.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":907.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":932.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":958.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.5,"local_amount":7559.97,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8291.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624863},{"amount":18.01,"local_amount":1440.63,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1580.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193938},{"amount":11.68,"local_amount":999.4,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1096.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.81,"payment_id":731022043}],"funded_date":"2014-08-05T09:53:17Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":746005,"name":"Blanca Nubia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Blanca de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, tiene dos hijos, vive con su esposo y uno de sus hijos en una aldea del municipio del Progreso, Yoro.

Ainagul has a secondary education. She works as a nurse in a local hospital. As an additional source of income for her family, she practices crop farming and livestock breeding.

Thanks to Ainagul's hard work, she currently has 1 milk cow and a calf on her farm, as well as a 1.45 hectare plot of land on which she primarily grows perennial grasses. Her average monthly income is 6,500 som (KGS). For the further development of her farm, and for the necessity of the imminent harvest gathering, Ainagul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 25,000 som (KGS) to pay for tractor services, baling and hay transportation. Ainagul plans to use the remaining funds to buy a calf. Ainagul wants to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

","en":"Narsulu is 57 years old, married and together with her husband, is raising 5 children. Narsulu has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practice livestock breeding and crop farming. Thanks to Narsulu's hard work, she currently has 2 cows on her farm, as well as a 1.10 hectare plot of land on which she grows eco-friendly tomatoes and corn for future sale to local residents. Her average monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). Her husband and her youngest son actively help her with her farm. They try to save money to use for the development and expansion of the business. As both of Narsulu's cows will soon give birth, she needs to quickly build a large barn for her cattle. This is why Narsulu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" for a 50,000 loan to buy slate, bricks and iron. When the cows give birth, Narsulu will sell milk and dairy products to local residents. In this way, she will increase her earnings from this \"green\" business and put her profits towards buying a plot of land for her son to build a house on."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1664078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy building supplies to construct a barn for her cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kabylan-Kol village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-08-04T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-03T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":105.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narsulu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":456.96,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":25202.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.54,"payment_id":610751373},{"amount":412.94,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25202.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":74.56,"payment_id":711410994}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T05:31:28Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:01:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":749261,"name":"Ibrahim Dan'asabe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nIbrahim Dan'Asabe is a maize farmer and member of Babban Gona.

Later, with another loan, they will complete the improvements.\r\n\r\nFor now, the need that has arisen is the maintenance of the vegetables and to cultivate another crop that is jute. It is a profitable crop in West Bengal.

Through the loan, Margaret is going to improve her living conditions and also improve the conditions of her six children by providing them with a solid education because education is the \u201ckey to success\u201d.\r\n\r\nKerugoya has a ready market for milk, and also the population is high. Hence, Margaret will not have a problem selling the milk and increasing her income level. \r\n\r\nMargaret is very disciplined with finances and she is sure that through accumulated profits, she will open a large dairy shop and be able to pay the loan on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1659641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-04T15:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-03T15:40:07Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1484.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1541.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1566.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1608.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1690.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1697.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1753.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1790.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1845.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1888.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1939.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1993.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.82,"local_amount":3729.23,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3933,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624864},{"amount":19.65,"local_amount":1634.61,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1723.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193939},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":3293.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3473.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261864},{"amount":41.93,"local_amount":3488.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3679.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600128},{"amount":42.51,"local_amount":3723.58,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3927.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.24,"payment_id":681376997},{"amount":42.68,"local_amount":3876.28,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4088.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.91,"payment_id":711505084},{"amount":11.93,"local_amount":1054.41,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1112.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":752110404}],"funded_date":"2014-08-04T17:01:21Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":749305,"name":"Dauda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dauda remembers the extreme poverty that his family faced  during a particularly bad harvest.

They want to increase their inventory and cater to more customers, but they lack capital.\r\n\r\nThus, Mamata has taken a loan from BJS (a Kiva partner), with which she will be able to purchase stocks of rice, oil, salt, sugar, lentils, chips, biscuits, etc. in bulk at lower rates from the wholesale market. This will help them steadily grow their small grocery store and they expect an increase in their monthly profits in the immediate future. This loan will help her family to take the first step towards a financially secure and stable future.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to her generous lenders for the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1659622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase stocks of groceries for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-04T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-03T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-07T15:57:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":746778,"name":"Eliab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eliab is a 40-year-old married man with 6 children from the Kagaramira cell in the Kiruhura district of Uganda.
