Therefore, during the rainy season the water ruins the flower production, which causes financial losses.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her business in order to improve her income and to give her three children a better future.  In order to do so, she needs a greenhouse  for her nursery.

Meet Agnes, a 56-year-old who is very hardworking, energetic and a mother of 4 lovely children. Agnes resides in the Kerugoya area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming activities. Agnes has been doing mixed farming for the past 40 years and through those years she has gathered so much experience with the techniques of farming. \r\n\r\nThrough the income from farming she has been able to take care of her family and also provide the basic needs for her grandchildren. Agnes is a very enterprising woman, and although she never got formal employment she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her family of a decent meal.\r\n\r\nThe Kerugoya area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate and a good transport network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Agnes feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. Agnes is very disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits she will be able to improve her living conditions and also secure the future of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1659866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-04T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-03T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.93,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2141.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2223.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2259.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2320.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2437.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2448.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2528.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2582.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2661.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2723.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2797.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2875.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.95,"local_amount":5138.31,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5260.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624868},{"amount":26.68,"local_amount":2287.01,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2341.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193943},{"amount":104.87,"local_amount":8988.83,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":9201.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261868},{"amount":150.57,"local_amount":13585.85,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13907.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.93,"payment_id":681376999}],"funded_date":"2014-08-05T08:18:44Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":746952,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty  is married and has been blessed with 9 children, three of whom attend school.

Meet Moses 23-years-of age, very young, hardworking and energetic. He hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya, an area that is blessed with good climatic conditions and favorable weather patterns that favor farming. Moses is still single and has been doing farming for the past three years.\r\n\r\nMoses was raised in a humble family, and he never got the opportunity to go to college because of lack of tuition fees. As a result of this, he never got any formal employment and didn\u2019t surrender to that. He started farming, and through farming he has been able to take care of his family and also to take care of his parents.\r\n\r\nMoses source of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kerugoya area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Moses is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Through the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh.\r\n\r\nMoses is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents.\r\n\r\nMoses' dream is to go back to school and he hopes that through your loan, you will help him realize his

Her son-in-law helps out with this work and her daughters help her economically.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy a heifer so she can have more cattle so that she can continue working in that which generates income for the household.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to always stay busy because this helps her to stay healthy. She also hopes to take good care of what she's worked so hard for so that one day she can leave her daughters an inheritance.

in Guatemala. The population is mainly Mayan Kaqchiquel and works in various endeavors including agriculture, fishing and handicrafts. Recently, a Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cJaibalito\u201d was formed by eight ladies. Their average age is 32 years old and they average 4 children. Only two members of the Trust Bank have had a formal education while the other six were unable to attend school.\r\n\r\nAntonia is a single 20-year-old mother who cherishes her son. He is her motivation to live and prosper and she works very arduously each day. She had to figure out a way to support herself and her son and now creates beautiful beaded treasures including bracelets, necklaces and other beaded objects. As Antonia  lives in an area that attracts tourists, she has a clientele who are eager to buy her beaded creations. In addition, she has found a way to export her products and this motivates her even more. Antonia is requesting her very first loan to purchase additional supplies including a wider variety of beads in additional colors, needles and thread.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the \u201cJaibalito\u201d Trust Bank and Antonia look forward to their monthly meetings, not only to take care of their loan business but also to acquire personal and business tools. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer brings the women new knowledge about health, hygiene and nutrition as well as women\u2019s rights, discrimination and violence against women. They become more effective businesswomen with newly acquired business tools (customer service, pricing, marketing, accounting and budgeting). They also learn about self-esteem and leadership. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. It is very effective!\r\n\r\nThank you, KIVA investors, for sharing your abundance by funding these much needed loans. The eight ladies of the \u201cJaibalito\u201d Trust Bank, including Antonia, will reap tremendous benefits for themselves, their families and their community of Jaibalito."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1660213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional supplies including a wider variety of beads in additional colors, needles and thread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Cruz la laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.75 -91.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2014-08-05T06:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-04T06:10:01Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Tourism"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Encarnacion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2503},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2503},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2503},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2503},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2503},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2503},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2503},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2479}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":322.27,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542515572},{"amount":322.26,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649109},{"amount":322.26,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579563960},{"amount":322.26,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595161339},{"amount":322.26,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610557863},{"amount":322.26,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231003},{"amount":322.26,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2518.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216734},{"amount":319.17,"local_amount":2479,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2494.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649566937}],"funded_date":"2014-08-13T02:05:35Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:36:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":747202,"name":"Utatlecas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cUtatlecas\u201d meaning \u201cWomen from Santa Luc\u00eda Utatl\u00e1n\u201d is the name of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank composed of eight hard-working and determined women in the Western Highlands of Guatemala.

In order to expand her business, Catarina needs to inject additional capital and so she is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge that she will invest in more chickens. She wants to be certain to keep her business healthy and her clients satisfied. Catarina is very pleased that with her income, she is able to meet the educational expenses of her daughters. One of them is about to graduate with a teaching certificate and Catarina wants her to obtain even more education at university level.\r\n\r\nThe success of the women in the Trust Bank is due to their own determination as well as the tools that they gain in the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge that combines the small loans and education. The ladies in the Trust Bank know that at each of their monthly meetings, they will gain practical business and personal tools from a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer.

\u201cOrquideas\u201d meaning \u201cOrchids\u201d. The ladies are focused to transform their lives through empowerment, small loans and education. They have a vision of raising their standard of living and creating a more prosperous future for themselves and their families.\r\n \r\nAmelia is a married member of the Trust Bank. She is a 33-year-old teacher with two daughters, one of whom is about to graduate from high school. Amelia wants to continue to support her daughter so that she can continue her studies at university. Amelia has a traditional textile business and sells her merchandise both retail and wholesale. She sells the complete \u201ctraje\u201d or traditional costume of blouse or heavier \u201chuipil\u201d, skirt, belt, and carrying cloth. She buys her merchandise at a wholesale price. Amelia is requesting a loan to diversify her merchandise with new styles and colors.\r\n\r\nAlthough Amelia had access to a university education, she is quite pleased to participate in the educational components of the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank. She always learns something new and useful and sees how her fellow Trust Bank members enhance their lives and their businesses. The majority of the ladies do not know how to read or write and so the educational training sessions are essential to their success as caretakers of their family members and business entrepreneurs. The training is given in the indigenous language of the women, often with pictures, and covers a variety of subjects including effective business management practices, nutritional and health tools, and self-esteem.\r\n \r\nThe seven women of the \u201cOrquideas\u201d Trust Bank look forward to blooming just like the flowers that they are named after, and to creating a brighter tomorrow as empowered women eliminating poverty. KIVA investors are essential partners in this effort and highly valued. We will report on the progress of Amelia and the ladies in the Trust Bank in the very near future. Thank you, KIVA investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1660183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To diversify her merchandise with new styles and colors, including skirts, belts, and carrying cloth.

She wants to be certain to satisfy the desires of her clients and generate enough income to continue with her university studies, which is her ultimate dream!\r\n\r\nEstrella shares that the educational program of Friendship Bridge has enabled her to enhance her business administration skills. She is better equipped to manage her loan and her business with newly acquired business knowledge (budgeting, accounting, customer service, marketing, pricing).

a time. He began working as an employee for a large local driving school, but found that while he was focused on imprinting students with the safest possible driving habits, his employers were more focused on extracting payments from their customers as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the shortcomings in how others run their businesses, Richard decided it was his time to try to start his own student-centric driving school. His school focused on providing a superlative level of customer service while ensuring that graduates of the program demonstrated the highest level of safety and conscientiousness on the road.\r\n\r\nRichard is quick to point out how much harder it would have been to start and maintain his business without his loan from Accion. He used his loan money to consolidate two outstanding loans he had for a total monthly savings of about $500, freeing up crucial capital for business start-up costs.\r\n\r\nRichard is keen to see his business grow in the future. He hopes one day to hire additional instructors so that he can service multiple clients simultaneously, and he has an extremely qualified candidate picked out to act as President\/CEO once the opportunity is there.\r\n\r\nMost of all, Richard wants his business exemplify the driving instruction industry\u2019s best practices.

As a Babban Gona member, Daniel Bawa is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Daniel Bawa can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Daniel Bawa is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 35 bags of maize per hectare this season.

In search of a source of income for her family, Bazarkan began practicing crop farming and livestock breeding. This business was started in 1995 with a purchase of 8 goats. Thanks to Bazarkan's back-breaking labor and intensive work, she was able to achieve lots of successes in her work. She began to receive an average monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS) from the sale of corn, milk and dairy products. Bazarkan also sells suzmo (sour cream cheese) and kurut (dried sour cream cheese, rolled into balls), which she and her husband make by hand. They currently have 100 kilograms of kurut and 150 kilograms of suzmo in circulation. Bazarkan currently has 5 dairy cows and 20 sheep on her farm. She also has on hand a plot of land on which she cultivates and plants corn on. <br \/><br \/>For the further development of her business, Bazarkan turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 40,000 som (KGS) which she will spend on the production of kurut to then later resell. She considers this a profitable investment, as the handmade production of eco-friendly products like local milk and kurut is in high demand amongst local residents and tourists alike. Bazarkan is one of three member of the group \"Zamira.\" Bazarkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further development of her small business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":503.75,"image":{"id":1664138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to hand-make kurut (dried sour cream cheese, rolled into balls) for future sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karazhygach village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-08-05T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-04T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bazarkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":239.15,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":13021.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.73,"payment_id":595436384},{"amount":228.35,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":13021.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.52,"payment_id":681290815}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T16:57:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":749819,"name":"Gabriel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gabriel is a Maize farmer from Ang\/Tafki.

She sells peanut butter and palm oil that she buys from female producers for resale in the capital and in the central regions.

She has a secondary education. All of her children are grown-up and self-sufficient. They live separately. Bubuazhar's husband helps her with her farm. Since 1994, she has been working in farming, specifically livestock breeding. She started this business with the purchase of one calf. Her current monthly income is about 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Bubuazhar's hard work, she currently has a great farm with 3 cows and 20 sheep. This income allowed Bubuazhar to breed her cattle on her small farm and thereby improving her family's living conditions. For the further development of her business, Bubuazhar turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 50,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and cattle feed. Bubuazhar plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

She used to work as a machine operator, but she had to quit in order to stay home and take care of her second child. She started a business to be able to help her husband with the home expenses. So far, she feels that being able to take care of her three children and her business at the same time is a blessing.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy products on a catalogue.

Thanks to Taalaigul's hard work and patient character, she currently has a great farm with 3 dairy cows, 15 sheep and 1 horse. She also has on hand a 1.08 hectare plot of irrigated land on which she annually grows sainfoin. For the further development of her farm, Taalaigul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 23,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep. Taalaigul plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

John D expressed that he is driven by one goal: to \u201cbecome the most profitable farmer in my community.\u201d It is the desire to fulfil this ambition that led John D to join Babban Gona. Now, as a Babban Gona member, he finally has the opportunity to access credit, good markets and a trained agronomist.

She lives alone as she is divorced. Previously, Galina lives in Chernobyl. Her children were part of the emergency clean-up team for the Chenobyl Nuclear Power Plant and, unfortunately, they have already died. Galina remains practically alone, but she found a woman who agreed to look after her. Galina lives in a two-bedroom apartment. The renovation on it is simple but adequate. Not long ago, she made renovations to her kitchen by putting in a reinforced plastic window. However, in the winter, the wind blows in all the same from the balcony. The apartment is penetrated by the cold and water flows in through the balcony. This is why she has long-since needed to undertake some measure to improve her living conditions. Galina wants to use 6,000 hryvnia to install a reinforced plastic unit on her apartment balcony so that it will be warm and water won't seep into the

Like all Babban Gona members, Yohanna can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Yohanna is ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 35 bags per hectare this season because with this loan, he will finally be able to access the required yield enhancing inputs such as improved seeds. Yohanna is hoping that as a result of this expected yield, he will finally have enough money to make significant life changes. When asked what changes he would like to make, he said \u201cI plan to use the money I make to expand my farmland.  Ultimately, I want to become the most profitable farmer in my community.\u201d With this loan, Yohanna will be able to access all the inputs and services to make these dreams reality.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1665155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To access high-quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed in order to double income and yield.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-08-05T17:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-04T17:10:07Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yohanna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":20874,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20874}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.67,"local_amount":20874,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":24179.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.33,"payment_id":752024732}],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T12:31:40Z","paid_date":"2015-11-19T13:10:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":746189,"name":"Jaime","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"O Sr. Jaime de 43 anos de idade casado e pai de 7 filhos dos quais 2 s\u00e3o independente e vivem nas suas pr\u00f3prias casa, 3 est\u00e3o a frequentar a escola no ensino prim\u00e1rio e secund\u00e1rio e os 2 sem idade para frequentar a escola.

Further, Patience volunteers at her former secondary school every week as a Camfed Learner Guide and teaches life skills to young students.

community for years now. She is 53 years of age and blessed with three children. She and her children work hard to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nShe sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Ofelia cannot manage to make her business more profitable and earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like to avail a loan amounting to 8,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products that are needed to increase her product inventory. Being a hardworking entrepreneur, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nOfelia dreams for her business to grow bigger and hopes to give her family a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1660501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional supplies and merchandise products like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-08-05T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-04T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.69,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2894.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000336},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2315.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491858},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2894.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625047},{"amount":13.34,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":578.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535203}],"funded_date":"2014-08-05T20:42:12Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:25:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":747338,"name":"Patrocinia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrocinia , a mother of six, has managed a general store for more than 10 years and earns well to support her family.

Meet Evans, an ambitious, hardworking and go-getting man who is 27 years of age. He hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is the training ground for many Kenyan Olympic runners and also is home to world record holders in athletics. Evans is still a single man, and he wants to lay a good foundation for his future family, which is why he started farming 3 years ago and has been making and earning a decent  income. Evans practices mixed farming, which is crop and dairy farming and through the two efforts he has been able to support his parents and also provide the basic needs that he requires.\r\n\r\nEldoret area is a very populated area, and Evans has been selling vegetables, milk and fruit to the nearby market. One challenge that is holding him back is the timely delivery of the product to the market. Milk and vegetables are very perishable and require timely delivery so that they can fetch a high price but this is hampered because the road network is poor and also the feeder roads are poor thereby leading to delays in the delivery of product. Because of the above reason, Evans has been having losses because the products reach the market when they are no longer fresh. Therefore, he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Through the motorbike he will be able to deliver the products on time to the market and be able to satisfy the increasing client base and market.\r\n\r\nEvans is an ambitious person and knowing that there are institutions such as Kiva that help young and enterprising people he feels relieved and knows that he will achieve all of his goals and desires.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Evans will also impact the life of another person because he will employ someone to ride the motorbike and help him with the farm work. Evans has learned a saving culture, and his plans for the extra income he will be getting are to help improve his living standards and also help his parents.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1660598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-05T20:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-04T20:20:08Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2256.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2992.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3018.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3149.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3185.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3270.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3481.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3452.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3580.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3769.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3841.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3945.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4070.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4161.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4284.94},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4388.95},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4507.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.35,"local_amount":5836.87,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5916.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547595},{"amount":39.4,"local_amount":3414.62,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3461.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680590},{"amount":37.46,"local_amount":3246.56,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3290.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624870},{"amount":42.12,"local_amount":3650.6,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3700.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193945},{"amount":563.67,"local_amount":48851.35,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":49518.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261870}],"funded_date":"2014-08-20T23:41:30Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":747392,"name":"Dania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dania is a 41-year-old married mother of three, who works hard with her beloved husband to provide their children with a better living and education.\r\nDania is a hard-working teacher, who works on providing the best education to others since twenty years ago.

Meet Ezekiah, a 31-year old hardworking, very ambitious and enterprising farmer from Eldoret, Kenya, which is home to the best marathon and Olympic runners who have broken world records. He is a proud father of three lovely children that he really loves and treasures. Ezekiah has been  farming for the past seven years, however, he is more interested with dairy farming and he loves his dairy cow and has even nicknamed his animal \u201cJesimat.\" Through profits from dairy farming he has been able to take care of his family and pay tuition fees for his school going children. Ezekiah is very appreciative of the fact that milk prices in Eldoret region are high and this enables him to enjoy a good profit margin. Although he has been making profits, he has a challenge of feeding his cows. This is why he is seeking a loan to buy a chuff cutter. This will assist in cutting hay into smaller pieces, aiding in digestion and preventing animals from rejecting any part of their food. Through the loan Ezekiah will be assured of a maximum production of milk from his cows and therefore increased profits. Ezekiah believes that the key to increased milk production is proper food and through the loan he will be assured of that.\r\n\r\nEzekiah plans to save more and buy more dairy cows so as to satisfy the client base and market that is already in his area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1660628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Nancy, an ever smiling, hardworking, and honest mother who is 26 years of age. She hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to the main campus of Moi University, and also home to the best athletes in the world. She is a proud mother of three lovely school-going children that she really values and treasures and will go an extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. \r\n\r\nNancy's primary source of income has been milk selling, crop farming, and poultry farming; through these ventures she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been practicing farming for five years, and through those years she has never regretted venturing into farming.\r\n\r\nNancy sells her products to the nearby market; that is vegetables, eggs, and milk. She has a challenge of timely delivery of the products and also meeting the demand that exists. She is always forced to walk for long distances to reach the market, and this really affects her. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan she will be able to timely deliver her products, and because her products are perishable, they require quick delivery and the motorbike will offer that.\r\n\r\nNancys dream is to get out of the poverty levels, and she is sure that through this loan she will be able to realize her dream.\r\n\r\nShe will like to empower others economically, and she plans to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farming activities and through this she will improve her living standards. Through the saving culture that Nancy has, she believes that she will repay the loan and increase her business of farming.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1660618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-05T20:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-04T20:50:16Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2510.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2993.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3041.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3150.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3208.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3294.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3440.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3475.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3582.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3771.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3866.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.87,"local_amount":6305.03,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6577.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547598},{"amount":37.76,"local_amount":3180.1,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3317.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680593},{"amount":36.48,"local_amount":3071.85,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3204.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624873},{"amount":39.57,"local_amount":3332.22,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193948},{"amount":78.76,"local_amount":6632.63,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6919.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261873},{"amount":207.56,"local_amount":17478.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":18233.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600134}],"funded_date":"2014-08-13T18:20:32Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":746611,"name":"Rosa Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Tosagua cada quince d\u00edas se re\u00fane el Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito Bachillero, este lugar se lo conoce por ser muy din\u00e1mico donde la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedican a la agricultura y a la cr\u00eda de animales, por ser una zona con gran vegetaci\u00f3n.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Rosa, tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene dos hijas de 16 y 15 a\u00f1os que estudian en colegio.
