The more items displayed in the store the better. More items to sell will result in increased profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMarilyn wants to expand soon. She hopes for more strength and good health to continuously operate her business.

Meet Dorcas, a 30-year-old farmer from Eldoret, an area in Kenya that is known for its expansive farmlands and an area that has produced world record-holders in athletics. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of three lovely school-going children and has been doing farming for the past six years. Through dairy farming and poultry keeping, she has been able to produce milk and eggs and earn an income through selling them. Dorcas loves farming very much and is so passionate with dairy farming, she has even nicknamed her cows \u201cCheptilit\", \"Tulmet\" and \"Chesamoi\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe Eldoret area has good conditions that favor horticulture farming, with a good road network, good climate and a ready market to sell horticulture products. Because of the above valid reasons, Dorcas wants to start horticulture farming and is seeking a loan of 30,000 Kenya shillings.\r\n\r\nDorcas has been having a dream of starting horticulture farming, but had one challenge; that is the lack of funds. But, knowing that institutions such as Kiva are out there to help enterprising women, she feels relieved and knows her dream will be achieved.\r\n\r\nThrough increased income, Dorcas will improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children.\r\n\r\nDorcas plans to sell in international markets, and she wants to take advantage of Eldoret International Airport, which will be of much help.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1660613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

After running a lunch truck and an ice cream truck, he seized a unique opportunity when a tire shop his cousin (pictured left) had worked at for 12 years closed down. Combining his cousin\u2019s expertise in the tire business with the discounted equipment he was able to obtain from his cousin\u2019s former employer, Hugo opened his newest venture: The Best Value Tire Shop.\n\nBesides being able to personally interact with his customers and ensure that they receive the highest quality of service, what Hugo likes best about running his own tire shop is the fact that as long as people drive cars, they\u2019re going to need to buy tires. This stability in demand gives Hugo the confidence to run his business knowing he will have a steady income stream to provide for his future wife and their four children.\n\nDespite having an experienced associate in the form of his cousin, Hugo\u2019s journey was not without its hurdles. He faced difficulties in securing the property for his business as well as in learning which sizes of tires to keep in stock at any given time. Nonetheless, Hugo is excited for what the future holds for his business:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to expand to do alignments, brakes, and mobile service, and eventually open up another location. For now, though, I\u2019d like to thank Accion and our Kiva lenders for giving me a chance to keep going.\u201d\n\nHugo will use his Kiva loan to expand inventory as well as cover operating costs. With the help of generous Kiva lenders, Hugo hopes to create a sustainable business that will support him and his family for many years to

If this wasn't hard enough, her husband left her with two young daughters.\n\nHowever, that did not leave her stuck at any time, on the contrary, she became stronger since she had to support her

elementary education.\n\nA zinc-walled house, an improvised bucket of water - just like the table where the corn mill grinds, show not only her efforts, but her creativity in working because she has created it with her imagination. \n\nRemittances sent by her eldest daughter from Spain have been a big help in succeeding with her business, but her dream of continuing to grow does not end there, because she needs a loan to enhance her mill and buy corn to make tortillas and tamales to sell.\n\nAmongst her plans is to buy another grinder for meat to have additional income, which will allow her

It not only draws the K'iche' Maya of the surrounding region but also vendors representing many of Guatemala\u2019s linguistic groups such as the Ixil, Kaqchikel, Mam and others, each dressed in their traditional costume and speaking their own unique language. The market is a rich tapestry of costumes, color, dialects, smells and the smoke from the tradition of burning incense on the steps of the cathedral right in the middle of the market. The area is well-known as a rich agricultural area with prolific orchards of fruit trees. Peaches, plums, pears, and apricots are harvested and distributed throughout the country. In addition, many in the area work in textile production, creating the colorful and beautiful traditional costumes of the area.\n\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank Women Del Sector Terminal is located here and are about to begin their second loan cycle with Kiva. The eight women in the Trust Bank share that with their previous loan, they were able to realize tremendous benefits in their various businesses. The ladies have an average age of 31 years, average one year of formal education, and average five children in their families.\n\nEva is one of the youngest members of the Trust Bank. She is 24 years old with three years of formal education. Eva is the Secretary of the Trust Bank. She not only has a small fruit orchard but also a traditional textile business. Eva is requesting a loan to invest in her orchard and wants to purchase seedlings and fertilizer. She wants to also purchase supplies for her textile business. She is looking at her orchard in the long term as it does take time for trees to grow and bear fruit. In the meantime, her textile business will generate enough income for her to take care of her short term needs.\n\nThe women of the \u201cMujeres del Sector Terminal\u201d Trust Bank and Eva understand the value of education. They work hard so that their children can gain access to a good education and a more prosperous future. At the same time, they benefit from the educational components of their monthly meetings when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer facilitates participatory educational trainings on a variety of subjects like how to be a successful entrepreneur (accounting, budgeting, marketing, pricing, customer service), keeping a healthy household (nutrition, healthful practices, personal hygiene) and self-esteem. \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is the name of the effective combination of the small loans and education.\n\nEva and her friends in the Trust Bank thank Kiva investors for their kindness in funding their loans. They are determined to empower themselves and eliminate poverty in their lives.

She is from the small village of Baroghoria, Dhupguri, in Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal.  She lives there with her husband along with her daughters. She sends her daughters to school and now they are in grades 3, 10 and grade 12. In her childhood, she did not get the opportunity to get more education due to the poor financial resources of her parents.  So she is earnestly trying to provide an education to her daughters.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer.  He cultivates different vegetables on his farmland in different seasons and sells them at the market.  Amita also assists her husband in fieldwork after managing her household work. With several years of experience in farm work, they have been able to get ahead despite the difficulties that have arisen along the way, including the rising costs of inputs and the instability of the prices for buying and selling vegetables. \r\n \r\nNow that her children have grown up and the family expenses are increasing day by day, they feel need to further improve their agricultural activities.  They have decided to cultivate paddy, which is an all-season crop. Being the staple food of West Bengal, it is in much demand throughout the year.  So, they think it will be a profitable business that will generate income.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Amita is requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy agricultural supplies such as paddy seeds, fertilizers etc. to start paddy cultivation. She has a lot of faith and she hopes to get ahead because her household expenses depend on this work.\r\n\r\nHer dream as a mother is to give a good education to her children so they can prosper in life.  With her profits, she plans to purchase more land in the future. \r\n\r\nShe conveys her thanks to her lenders for the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1660714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and fertilizers for cultivating paddy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-05T23:20:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-04T23:20:25Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-09T14:44:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":747507,"name":"Faustin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustin is a 37-year-old businessman who has been running a Micro Distribution Centre (MDC) since 2004.

He hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, an area that has produced all the famous athletes in marathons for the world; it is also referred to as the \u201dhome of champions\u201d. Cosmas is from a humble background, and his upbringing was very challenging. He had to work extra hard if he was to succeed in life, and that is why he started farming three years ago so that he can make his dream a reality.\r\n\r\nThrough income from dairy farming, crop farming, and some personal business, he has been able to support his family and also support his ageing parents. Cosmas is the only bread winner in his family, and he has to work extra hard so as to provide for his family and also support his siblings.\r\nAlthough Cosmas has been doing farming, he is faced with the challenge of transporting his products to the market because of poor transport system and poor feeder roads from his village; he has been incurring losses through the lack of timely delivery. Because of the above valid reasons he is kindly requesting a loan to buy a motorbike to be able to transport his products to the market.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Cosmas will be able to satisfy the ready market for milk, eggs and vegetables that is there in his village. This loan will greatly improve the life of Cosmas, and he will be able to have a permanent change of lifestyle both for his siblings and also his family.\r\n\r\nCosmas' future plan is to open a large shop in the market where he will be selling and packaging his products both for wholesalers and

Meet Jenifer, a hardworking, very honest and warmhearted farmer who hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming.

Jenifer\u2019s upbringing was very challenging and because of this she promised herself that she would work hard and get out of the poverty situation. That is why she started farming 10 years ago and through farming she has been able to earn a decent income. Jenifer is the breadwinner in her family and this really pushes her to work hard so that her two children will have a bright future and also her parents will have a comfortable life.<br \/><br \/>Jenifer is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming so that she can use the excess space on her land and she dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticulture farming.<br \/><br \/>Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Jenifer is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change.<br \/><br \/>Through the income from horticulture farming, Jenifer will assure her children of a bright future and she will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her.

Her parents did not support her and thought it would be better for her to work.  She is married and has six children.  Her husband is deceased, so she continues to work in order to help her family get ahead.  <br \/><br \/>Francisca has been selling fruits and vegetables from a very young age.  Her parents also sold fruit at the city market, which is where she learned the trade.  She started her own business of selling fruits, vegetables, cakes, tamales, and various types of bread.  In addition, her parents taught her how to produce soap, bed mats, and woven rope that she had to make with her siblings before going out to sell them in the community.  <br \/><br \/>The loan she is requesting will be used to buy a cow so that she can increase her herd.  The rest of the loan will be used to buy more fruits and vegetables, which will allow her to have more variety that she can offer to her customers.  <br \/><br \/>Francisca dreams of having a small pig pen at home since she has enough space to build one."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1658337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Meet Albert, a very hardworking, honest and easy-to-get-along-with farmer. He hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is known all over the world because it's home to the best marathon runners. Albert is a father of three lovely children who he really adores, and they always make Albert work extra hard so that they can have a secure future. Albert's upbringing was very challenging and he never got all the basic needs that he desired, but he promised himself that he will work extra hard to improve his living conditions and also improve the living conditions for his parents. This is why he started farming and he has been doing it for the last eight years. Albert's primary source of income is crop and dairy farming and through this, he has been able to earn an honest income.\r\n\r\nAlbert passionately loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201dGomargong.\" Albert has a large amount of space on his farm so he wants to increase the number of his dairy cows. However, one challenge he is facing is accessing funds because he is a small-scale farmer. Knowing that organizations such as Kiva support small-scale farmers, Albert feels relieved and knows his dream of improving his living conditions will be realized.\r\n\r\nAlbert plans to accumulate the profits gathered and open a feed shop, and a milk retail shop. Through this he will be able to comfortably take care of his family and siblings and assure them of a bright future. Albert believes that through your loan you will be delivering the promise of transforming lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1660863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

in Southwestern Guatemala.  The local economy is based on hundreds of small family-owned and operated clothing fabricators, with the result that clothing exports now exceed the traditional ones of coffee, sugar, and bananas. In a neighborhood of the town, the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cNueva Vision Tacajalve\u201d meaning \u201cNew Vision of Tacajalve\u201d was formed by 13 women,  the  average age is 42 years. \r\n\r\nSebastiana is a member of the Trust Bank and applying for her very first loan. She is a single, 26-year-old woman who completed school through the 5th grade because her family was poor and she had to work. Several years ago, Sebastiana began her textile business and sells clothing for men, women and children. She sells each day during the week at the local market. She needs to infuse more capital into the business and will use the funds to purchase  pants, t-shirts, and blouses of various sizes, colors and designs. Sebastiana wants to keep her current customers happy and at the same time, attract new customers. She uses the profits from her business to meet the expenses of her large family. Sebastiana has seven siblings and her parents\u2019 income is not enough to cover all the expenses.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the loans, Sebastiana and the ladies in the Trust Bank benefit from the non-formal education program of Friendship Bridge. Each month, a Loan Officer from the organization shares practical information with the women. Among the topics covered are women\u2019s leadership, women\u2019s identity, empowerment and self-esteem as well as health, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants.

This loan was paid off completely and successfully. Now the group is applying for a new loan which they hope the KIVA investors will fund. For this new loan cycle, the group is composed of thirteen women, one of which is new to the group.\r\n\r\nAs with all the Friendship Bridge Trust Banks, \"Las Cruces\" has its own Board of Directors. Anastasia is 25 years old and Treasurer of the group. She married at a very young age and has four children. Anastasia has a textile business that she started four years ago and creates beautiful high quality traditional clothing. Specifically, she weaves \u201ccortes\u201d that are tubular skirts generally woven on a foot-powered, treadle loom.  The business is progressing quite well and Anastasia now has two employees. She requests a loan to purchase two more foot looms and to buy supplies including thread for her business.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank are very aware of the importance of education. Anastasia is pleased that three of her children are in elementary school, an opportunity that she was not afforded. Anastasia has a chance to gain new knowledge at the monthly meetings of her Trust Bank when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer conducts educational seminars on relevant subjects like effective business management practices, nutrition, health and hygiene as well as self-esteem and women\u2019s empowerment. Friendship Bridge has called the effective combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nFriendship Bridge and KIVA form a useful and successful alliance in the lives of the women of the \u201cLas Cruces\u201d Trust Bank. The ladies are very happy and grateful to be able to empower themselves and create better lives for themselves, their families and their community of Chuanoj, Guatemala."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5450,"image":{"id":1661844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

They are now applying for a new loan cycle with KIVA. The ladies want KIVA investors to know that with the previous loan, they were able to sustain or expand their small businesses, that benefitted themselves and their families. \r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the group for this new loan cycle is Juana who is 45 years old and has 3 children. Juana is starting her second loan cycle and she reports that with her first loan, she felt very blessed because she increased her income. Juana has two businesses which are textile production and animal husbandry. She is applying for a new loan and will use it to purchase 100 chickens, chicken feed,  thread and supplies for her textile business. She is very excited about the possibilities for expansion of both businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank \u201cChuimekena\u201d looks forward to their monthly meetings when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer meets with them. Besides conducting business transactions, the Loan Officer presents educational trainings and the ladies can immediately put the newly acquired information to work in their lives. They are eager to learn about effective business practices, budgeting and accounting. The women also learn about hygiene, health and medicinal plants. Other relevant subjects include nutrition, self esteem and women\u2019s rights. \r\n\r\nThe women are grateful for the opportunity to secure loans and education. They are hopeful to gain support from investors throughout the world. Empowered by their new tools and their determination to empower themselves and eliminate poverty, they face a brighter tomorrow filled with hope and new dreams. KIVA investors are valuable partners in this

participatory education to impoverished women so that they can create their own solution to fight against poverty for themselves, their families, and communities. The loans are of great value to the 11 members of the Friendship Bridge \u201cCelestial\u201d Trust Bank. The ultimate goal for the women is to break the cycle of poverty for themselves and for future generations.\r\n\r\nFlorencia is a 58-year-old woman from Cantel, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala and a member of the Trust Bank \u201cCelestial\u201d meaning \u201cHeavenly\u201d. She is starting her second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, funded by Kiva investors. Florencia has a convenience store and will use her new loan to buy inventory including rice, pasta, chorizo, cheese, sausage, sugar, juices and coffee.  She reports that her business is progressing well and that she wants to invest additional funds to generate more income for her family. \r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank have been participating in the educational training program of Friendship Bridge at their monthly meetings. A loan officer facilitates this part of the meetings and the ladies enhance their leadership skills, participate in group discussions and practice teamwork techniques. They discuss topics such as women\u2019s health, self-esteem and leadership. They learn about women\u2019s rights and violence against women. To help them with their loans and small businesses, they learn about business management and administration, budgeting, accounting and marketing. Finally, the ladies learn about the use of medicinal plants and nutrition. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and educational trainings \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are greatly appreciated by the women of the \u201cCelestial\u201d Trust Bank for their kindness and generosity in providing capital for their loans. We shall report on their progress in an upcoming report.

Lisi plans to use this money to purchase chemicals, a wheelbarrow, bush knives, and vegetable seeds to better improve her plantation. She hopes to make a lot of profit from her business so she is able to contribute to the improvement of her family's livelihood."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1661893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

tremendously in recent times. Just outside of the populated area, there is a small community where a group of women have organized themselves into the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cMariposas\u201d which means \u201cButterflies\u201d. Actually, the ladies look like butterflies with their intricately decorated and colorful lightweight blouses, often embellished with lace and sequins. The traditional attire is also quite colorful and beautiful. The women of the Trust Bank have an average age of 36.\r\n\r\nGloria, a member of the group, is 36 years old and married to an agricultural worker. The couple has four children ranging in age from five to seventeen. Gloria has an animal husbandry business and raises chickens and pigs. She is applying for a loan to purchase additional animals and feed. Gloria is very aware of the value of education, in spite of the fact that she only had two years of formal education. She works hard to provide her children with uniforms, school supplies and other necessities. Gloria feels that her efforts are paying off as her oldest child will graduate from high school next year!\r\n\r\nGloria enjoys the monthly educational training given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer at the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank. The ladies acquire business and personal tools that serve them well. They learn about women\u2019s rights and domestic violence, health, hygiene and nutrition as well as children\u2019s education. The women learn to manage their loans with information about budgeting, accounting, marketing, pricing and customer service. They learn how to have confidence in themselves and in their decision-making abilities. The combination of loans and education, that Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is very empowering for the ladies. They begin to understand that they have the ability to make a difference in their lives and in their families and leave poverty behind. KIVA investors are valuable partners in this effort by providing capital for the loans.

old and she is married with three children.  She has a high school education and she works as a nurse in the central polyclinic, which is the main source of income for her family.  To make extra money, she also raises livestock and grows crops, which is a business she started 12 years ago with the sum of 3,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Cholpon's hard work, her farm now has two dairy cows, two calves, one mare and a .60 hectare plot of land on which she grows annual crops of clover and beans.  Her family also rents a 2.6 hectare plot of land.  Their combined monthly income is 28,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nThe money they have saved has allowed them to start building their own home, but they don't have enough to finish it.  This is why Cholpon has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy and install energy-saving plastic windows and doors.  She wants to make sure her family has a comfortable and cozy home without harming the environment, and she also believes the plastic windows will save her money on the heating bills.  The family's combined income from their work and their farming efforts will allow them to save up for their elder daughter's university education."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1665566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She received an education at a medical college, but she does not work in that profession. Two years ago, she started offering sewing services out of her home. She learned this trade from her neighbor. In a short period of time, Savriniso has been able to attract her own loyal customers, as she treats them with respect and always does her best to fulfill their orders by the deadline. Now Savriniso has decided to expand her business. In addition to sewing dresses, she also wants to do custom, original embroidery on them. However, she does not have the appropriate sewing machine for this.

She started her business in 1988 when, due to the need to generate income for the family, she started out in trade and started to develop skills so that she could make items decorated with her own hands. She makes her sales directly to the end consumers daily on the basis of advance orders.  Her goal is to fortify her working capital and her profits, and to provide her children, aged 14 to 22, with a quality education.  \r\n\r\nRosa's main challenge is to obtain sufficient working capital so that she can respond to her customers' orders.  This is why she applied for this Kiva loan, the first financing she has done with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, she will buy plastic soles, a glass display case, and construction supplies so that she can make some improvements to her store.

community currently has 40 village customers, six of whom are CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members helping lead the loan program in the area. Each villager will receive about $190.\r\n\r\nA new loan would enable this community to buy crop inputs such as seeds and fertilizer for crops such as bean, betel and onion. This will improve their yields and therefore crop sales, leading to an increase in the farmers' incomes. Villagers hope to use this additional income to dig a well to increase the village's access to clean water. Currently, village members must spend $15 per month and substantial amounts of time to collect clean water to drink.\r\n\r\nPictured above are U Toe, U Han, U Maw, U Chit, U Than, and U Han. They all are CBO members from the Ma Gyi Kone Village. Included in the photo (fourth from the left) is 47-year-old U Han, the father of three children.

Her business challenge is the poor infrastructure that increases her transportation costs to get her matooke to the market. Sarah describes herself as hardworking and honest. \r\n\r\nSarah is requesting a loan to buy a plot of land to build rental properties to supplement her income. She has already put a deposit on the plot of land. Her anticipated clients will be residents. In the future, Sarah hopes to build some more rentals for her children and to educate her children.

The filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most find the filter works from 3-5 years."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1665866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to purchase TerraClear water filters so they can have access to safe drinking water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Xebangfai District, Khammoune Province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":393,"posted_date":"2014-08-06T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-05T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souk","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LAK","disbursal_amount":1880000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1880000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":213929.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530237359},{"amount":8.48,"local_amount":63744.4,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68184.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542670381},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":213929.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579772216},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-25T11:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":213929.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":597066497},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":427859.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611965529},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":200000.6,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":213930.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637757854},{"amount":81.93,"local_amount":616255,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":659176.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649742353}],"funded_date":"2014-08-06T19:35:55Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T15:44:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":748036,"name":"Seymur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seymur is 30 years old.

The Eldoret area has a cool climate but sometimes experiences long dry spells and this accounts for major crop failure leading to starvation. Duncan is seeking a loan to purchase a high quality dairy cow. Easy availability of feed and fodder all year round makes dairy farming an ideal choice of investment in this region.<br \/><br \/>Through the loan Duncan will be able to fully satisfy the demand of

The above picture presents to you Aggrey, a very hard-working, honest, and ever-smiling man who is only 42 years of age. He hails from a region referred to as a city of champions, Eldoret. This region has produced the best world record holders in athletics and has one of the most favorable weather patterns in the world. \r\n\r\nAggrey is not your ordinary small-scale farmer, as evidenced by his carefully conceived business plan. He has been practicing farming for the past 15 years and, through those years, he has gained so much experience and is touted as one of the best farmers in his village. He loves dairy farming and has nicknamed his dairy cows 'Lelkina' and 'Barirmet.' \r\n\r\nAggrey wants to implement his business idea of starting passion fruit farming and, hence, he is kindly requesting a loan, so that he can make his dream come true. Through the training program that Juhudi Kilimo offered Aggrey, he is comfortable that, given the loan, he will turn his life around and he will be able to secure the future of his children. Through the extension services offered by Juhudi Kilimo, he will be able to market his passion fruits to the nearby markets and make good profits. Aggrey plans to sell, not only in the domestic market, but also in international markets and he wants to use the advantage of his proximity to Eldoret International Airport to transport his products.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1662178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Eliud one of the most hardworking man on earth who is 46 years of age and very dedicated and passionate about farming. He hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, an area where out of ten people you meet two are athletes. Eliud never got a white collar job but he did not give up on his dream of succeeding in life. He began farming and has been doing it passionately for 24 years. Through all those years he has been able to support his family financially. Eliud loves dairy farming a lot because Eldoret region has one of the best conditions that support dairy farming because of plenty of dairy food and fodder for dairy cows. He has nicknamed his cows \u201cMaua and salat\u201d which means flower. That is what the cows are to him. They are his flowers.\r\n\r\nBecause of good weather patterns, plenty of animal food and a ready market for milk products, Eliud is seeking a loan to buy another dairy cow. He believes that through the loan he will be able to improve his living conditions and be able to secure the future of his children.\r\nHaving gone through training with Juhudi kilimo he is confident that the skills he acquired will help him increase his business and be able to pay back the loan.
