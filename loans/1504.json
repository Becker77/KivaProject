She comes from a household of parents that are separated.  Her mother has been father and mother to her.  Her mother has been working hard as an independent nurse in order to get her ahead in her education.\r\n\r\nKaroline is studying automobile mechanics, a career that is mainly dominated by men.  Nevertheless, she is not intimidated.  To the contrary, she took it as a challenge to give her maximum effort and to show that she is able to triumph and stand out in a normally masculine profession.  Even though her career demands that she wear a uniform and get her hands dirty, she is a very happy and feminine girl.  She really likes to look good.\r\n\r\nShe is currently in the fifth cycle, and she is a step away from completing her degree.  There are six cycles in her career studies.  However, the lack of work that her mother is experiencing makes it difficult to generate enough income to be able to cover her educational expenses.  This situation means that she would need to leave her studies, with so little left to complete, if she does not have the support of the Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nKaroline is a tenacious young woman like her mother.  She wants to make her mother proud of her, complete her career studies, and get ahead together.  That is why she is very grateful for the support that the Kiva lenders give to young people like her who have a great desire to study and triumph in life, giving their maximum effort in order to do so.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1359.34,"image":{"id":1660216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to be able to graduate from her auto mechanic career studies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":358,"posted_date":"2014-08-06T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-05T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":37.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karoline Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":184.15,"local_amount":509.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-18T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":513.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542540725},{"amount":92.99,"local_amount":257.22,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":259.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561673811},{"amount":93.62,"local_amount":258.94,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":261.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579597655},{"amount":84.4,"local_amount":233.45,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:25:07Z","rounded_local_amount":235.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595187723},{"amount":93.71,"local_amount":260.49,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":262.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.47,"payment_id":611811590},{"amount":89.85,"local_amount":250.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":252.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.77,"payment_id":624256265},{"amount":216.22,"local_amount":615.75,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":621.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.4,"payment_id":665454488},{"amount":282.31,"local_amount":823.96,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":831.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.58,"payment_id":696582531},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":194.18,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":195.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.54,"payment_id":731018240},{"amount":118.36,"local_amount":355.89,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":359.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.31,"payment_id":752106562}],"funded_date":"2014-08-07T21:20:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":747171,"name":"Erika Ver\u00f3nica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erika es una se\u00f1ora de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es empleada, estudi\u00f3 hasta el tercer a\u00f1o de bachillerato en salud, esta casada y es madre de 3 hijos que se encuentran estudiando; por lo tanto son los que dependen de ella, su esposo trabaja como motorista en un cami\u00f3n de venta de materiales para construcci\u00f3n.\n\nErika se dedica a trabajar como promotora social en la comunidad donde ella reside desde hace un a\u00f1o, trabajo que lo aprendi\u00f3 practicando en la escuela, para trasladarse a su trabajo Erika viaja en bicicleta cinco cuadras trabajando en el horario de 8:00 am a 3:00 pm.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando en la instituci\u00f3n, es para comprar materiales como cemento, ladrillo, hierro etc. Para la construcci\u00f3n de un corredor de su vivienda.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Erika es que sus hijos sean unos profesionales, para que puedan alcanzar sus metas y ser unos j\u00f3venes de bien.\n","en":"Erika is 30 years old and is employed.

He has also managed to buy a cow that has given him some milk to improve his household diet and sells part of the milk to supplement his income.\r\nHe hopes to use the loan of 300,000 UGX to buy mulch for his plantation, which currently is suffering through a dry spell, to avoid loss of soil moisture affecting his yields. He says that the UGAFODE loan has been a major stepping stone to his success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1662237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy mulches.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-08-06T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-05T22:30:07Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-20T10:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":81875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530923260},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":81875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542676642},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561810249},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":81875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579786545}],"funded_date":"2014-08-07T00:55:31Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T15:48:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":748086,"name":"Goran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goran is 42, divorced and the father of two children, one girl and one boy between the ages 9 and 12 years old.

He is married and has three children; none of them are currently in school.

is 46 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka region of Uganda.

For the past six years, Rashid has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells items such as sugar, rice, posho (or ugali, made from maize or cassava), sodas, salt, mineral water, soap, beer, cooking oil, toilet paper, millet flour, etc. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Rashid has requested a loan of  4,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy sugar, rice, posho, sodas, salt, mineral water, soap, beer, cooking oil, toilet paper, millet flour, etc. and will help Rashid to generate greater profits to support his family. He hopes that in the future, he will be able to expand his business. \r\n\r\nRashid is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

For the past two years, Ivan has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells items like sugar, rice, posho (or ugali, made from cassava or maize), sodas, salt, mineral water, soap, beer, cooking oil, toilet paper, millet flour, etc. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Ivan has requested a loan of 4,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy items like sugar, rice, posho, sodas, salt, mineral water, soap, beer, cooking oil, toilet paper, millet flour, etc. to sell. This will help Ivan to generate greater profits and boost the business. He hopes that in the future, he will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nIvan is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

Hence, she is putting extra efforts into farming so that she can make ends meet. \r\n\r\nFlorence is seeking funds to build a greenhouse on her piece of land and with the greenhouse, her crops will have controlled environmental conditions that are ideal for crops to grow healthy. With the loan, Florence will increase her supply of tomatoes and she will be assured of more income.\r\n\r\nBeing a mother in Africa is very challenging and accessing funds is so hard but with institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Florence is assured of realizing her dream.\r\n\r\nFlorence has undergone training on how to save the income generated from the greenhouse and she is much disciplined with finances.

She has only one 27-year-old son and the family earns a living through agricultural activities. In particular Gulnazi takes care of milk cows and cattle. She sells milk products locally, but the income is insignificant and they live in poverty. Gulnazi has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trade business but could not secure funding. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. Gulnazi requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start up loan program provides start up credit with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income and do not have access to credit. With the received credit, Gulnazi will purchase materials for sewing bags and will then start trading. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start up loan, will significantly increase the family's income and the family members will be able to improve their living

She launched her business with a starting capital of 3,000 KGS and has been very successful. Her farm now includes two dairy cows, five sheep and one horse. She also has a land plot; she grows strawberries on 0.5 ha [1 acre] of her land and uses the rest to grow raspberries and other berries and fruits. During the summer season, Dildakul hires people from her village to help with harvesting and then sells her produce to wholesalers. In winter she sells milk. Since the second strawberry harvest just began, Dildakul has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance association for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy fertilizers such as niter [potassium nitrate] and to pay for weeding. Dildakul would like to use the resulting revenues to expand her farm. She also plans to buy a car for her family, which is needed both for personal use and for her business.

She has a secondary education has been raising livestock and planting crops since 1996. Her spouse helps her on the farm and works as a shepherd. Gulzat currently has two dairy cows, one bull, one calf, two horses, 0.8 hectares of her own land, and 0.4 hectares of rented land where she plants potatoes and sainfoin. Her main income comes from milk sales. When she does not have enough of her own milk, she has to buy it from her fellow villagers. Local organic milk is in high demand and because she currently does not have enough milk, she has applied for a loan with Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 40,000 somoni to buy a dairy cow. She plans to use her profits to invest in additional purebred dairy cows and to build a house for her family.

Hiram has been farming for the past 6 years, but his heart is on dairy farming he really enjoys milking and feeding his animals. Because of unpredictable weather, pattern crop farming is not profitable. This is why Hiram has put all his energy into dairy farming and has been able to sell the fruits of his labour (milk) to his neighbors and nearby markets.\r\n\r\nThe Molo area has high demand for milk and dairy products, and Hiram, being an enterprising person, wants to take advantage of that. This is why he is kindly seeking a loan of 65000 Kenyan shillings to be able to buy a quality dairy cow. Hiram projects that the cow will give him 15 litres of milk a day, which will comfortably allow him improve his living conditions and be able to repay the loan on time. \r\n\r\nWith your lending Hiram is going to improve the quality of his dairy farming and introduce zero grazing in the future. Hiram is very determined and focused and plans that, through savings from accumulated profits, he will be able to open a large dairy shop where he will be selling milk and milk products. With the loan, Hiram\u2019s life will permanently change and he will assure his family a bright future and better living

Thanks to her hard work she now has two cows, two horses and 13 sheep as well as 4.8 hectares of land where she grows potatoes, barley and other crops. With the goal of further developing her business, Zhekshegul has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 125,000 KGS to increase her head count of livestock by buying two steers, as well as to build a temporary building.

Justine is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kangulumira in the Jinja region of Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past 1 year, Justine has been working hard to manage her food stall, which sells tomatoes, onions, and bananas. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food items like cassava, eggplants, and avocado for the stall and will help Justine to generate greater profits and educate her child. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1662511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

For the past 6 years, Ajara has been working hard to manage her clothing shop, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ajara has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes, and will help Ajara to generate greater profits and ensure personal development. Ajara hopes that in the future she will be able to expand on the business. \r\n\r\nAjara is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Prossy is 16 years old and lives in the town of Njeru in the Jinja region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past 2 years, Prossy has been working hard to manage her clothing shop, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prossy has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more clothes and will help Prossy to generate greater profits and expand on the business. Prossy hopes that in the future she will be able to have a profitable big business. \r\n\r\nProssy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Halima is 20 years old and lives in the town of Njeru in the Jinja region of Uganda. She is single and has 2 children with neither of them currently in school. For the past 3 years, Halima has been working hard to manage her clothing shop, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Halima has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more clothes and will help Halima to generate greater profits and provide for her family. Halima hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a saloon. \r\n\r\nHalima is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1662516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Josephine is 18 years old and lives in the town of Ishaka in the Kabwohe region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past year, Josephine has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells curry powder, tea leaves, bread, sugar, biscuits. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Josephine has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy curry powder, tea leaves, bread, sugar, biscuits, and will help Josephine to generate greater profits and provide basic needs for the family. Josephine hopes that in the future she will be able to accumulate savings. \r\n\r\nJosephine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Marine has been working hard to manage her farming business, which enables her to sell tea leaves. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Marine has requested a loan of 600,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more trees to grow and will help Marine to generate greater profits and educate her siblings. Marine hopes that in the future she will be able to earn more profits. \r\n\r\nMarine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

For the past year, Adrine has been working hard to manage her food stall business, where she sells tomatoes, bananas, onions and Irish potatoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Adrine has requested a loan of 600,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy tomatoes, bananas, onions and Irish potatoes. The loan will help Adrine to generate greater profits and improve her business. Adrine hopes that in the future she will be able to own a car. \r\n\r\nAdrine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Mackline is 17 years old and lives in the town of Rubirizi in the Kabwohe region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past 2 years, Mackline has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where she sells household commodities. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mackline has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more household commodities, and will help Mackline to generate greater profits and gain personal development. Mackline hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the shop. \r\n\r\nMackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past year, Fausta has been working hard to manage her food stall business, which sells tomatoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Fausta has requested a loan of 450,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more tomatoes, and will help Fausta to generate greater profits and business expansion. Fausta hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand financially. \r\n\r\nFausta is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Docus is 16 years old and lives in the town of Isingiro in the Mbarara region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past 8 months, Docus has been working hard to manage her food stall business, where she sells cabbage, tomatoes, dry fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Docus has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

For the past three years, Christine has been working hard to manage her farming business, which sells coffee. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Christine has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more farm items, and will help Christine to generate greater profits and increase income. Christine hopes that in the future, she will be able to earn more profits. \r\n\r\nChristine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past year, Doreen has been working hard to manage her business, which sells eggplants, tomatoes, small fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Doreen has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy eggplants, tomatoes, small fish, and will help Doreen to generate greater profits and earn more income. Doreen hopes that in the future she will be able to save money and return to school. \r\n\r\nDoreen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Sonko is 16 years old and lives in the town of Isingiro in the Mbarara region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past year, Sonko has been working hard to manage her soft drinks shop, where she sells soft drinks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sonko has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more soft drinks, and will help Sonko to generate greater profits and provide personal needs for the family. Sonko hopes that in the future she will be able to own a bigger business and a boutique. \r\n\r\nSonko is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past 3 years, Evas has been working hard to manage her fish-vending business, where she sells fish.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Evas has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fish, a frying pan, a net and cooking oil, and will help Evas to generate greater profits and expand the business. Evas hopes that in the future she will be able to develop herself further. \r\n\r\nEvas is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Sylivia is 21 years old and lives in the town of Ntungamo in the Ntungamo region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past two and a half years, Sylivia has been working hard to manage her food stall, which sells tomatoes, bananas, cassava, beans, groundnuts, and millet flour. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sylivia has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase tomatoes, bananas, cassava, beans, groundnuts, and millet flour, and will help Sylivia to generate greater profits and improve her standard of living. She hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a big retail shop. \r\n\r\nSylivia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Klemensia has been working hard to manage her clothing shop, in which she sells second-hand clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Klemensia has requested a loan of UGX 500,000 (Ugandan shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes and will help Klemensia to generate greater profits and expand the business. Klemensia hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nKlemensia is a member of BRAC Uganda's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1662598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

Diina is 22 years old and lives in the town of Ntungamo in the Ntungamo region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past three years, Diina has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, cooking oil, soap, utensils, blue band, sodas, and curry powder. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Diina has requested a loan of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more sugar, salt, cooking oil, soap, utensils, blue band, sodas, and curry powder, and will help Diina to generate greater profits and expand on the business. Diina hopes that in the future she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nDiina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1662591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Jovert is 23 years old and lives in the town of Ntungamo in the Ntungamo region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past two years, Jovert has been working hard to manage her clothing shop, which sells used clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jovert has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more clothes, and will help Jovert to generate greater profits and provide for her family members. Jovert hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nJovert is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1662604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

Penlope is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kabwohe in the Kabwohe region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Penlope has been working hard to manage her farming business, which grows cash crops. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Penlope has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy seeds for planting, and will help Penlope to generate greater profits and provide for her family. Penlope hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nPenlope is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1662606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She is 18 years old and lives in the town of Mbarara in the Mbarara region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past three years, Prima has been working hard to manage her food stall business, which sells tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and Irish potatoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prima has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and Irish potatoes, and will help Prima to generate greater profits and personal development. Prima hopes that in the future she will be able to return to school and become a teacher. \r\n\r\nPrima is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1662575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The loan will be used to buy craft materials, and will help Cloris to generate greater profits and provide for her family. Cloris hopes that in the future she will be able to return to school. \r\n\r\nCloris is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kabwohe in the Kabwohe region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past three years, Gift has been working hard to manage her retail shop where she sells sugar, rice, posho, and salt. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Gift has requested a loan of 600,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase sugar, rice, posho, and salt, and will help Gift to generate greater profits and personal development. Gift hopes that in the future, she will be able to save money and return to school. \r\n\r\nGift is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1662609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kabwohe in the Kabwohe region of Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past four years, Caroline has been working hard to manage her charcoal sales business, which sells charcoal and foodstuff. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Caroline has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal, and will help Caroline to generate greater profits and educate her child. Caroline hopes that in the future she will be able to develop the business to a retail shop. \r\n\r\nCaroline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1662611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Pamela is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kabwohe in the Kabwohe region of Uganda. She is married and has no children. For the past one and a half years, Pamela has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells cooking oil, sugar, salt, and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Pamela has requested a loan of 300,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more cooking oil, sugar, salt, and soap, and will help Pamela to generate greater profits and add a stock of clothes to the business. Pamela hopes that in the future she will be able to become a big businesswoman. \r\n\r\nPamela is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is single and works weaving wool suits.  She is a very cheerful, friendly, happy, hardworking, enterprising, and dedicated person.  Despite her young age, she has many goals and objectives in life.  She runs her business in the \"16 de julio\" region, every thursday and sunday in the local market.  Gabriela has a dark complexion, long, straight, black hair, brown eyes, and she is of medium height.  She learned her trade from her mother who after seeing the few work opportunities and the difficulty accessing higher education, decided to teach her the art of weaving.  \r\n\r\nAfter finishing high school, Gabriela devoted herself completely to working and weaving.  Through this, she is able to earn an income to help her family.  She works from Monday to Sunday, and everyday, she weaves, except for Thursdays and Sundays when she runs her stand in the \"16 de julio\" market.  \r\n\r\nHer workshop is a room that she also uses as a bedroom.  She needs to collect money to refurbish the walls  and improve the work environment, and in so doing, improve her quality of life.  Her dream is to increase her productivity and have a workshop for weaving and sewing in order to diversity her production.  For these reasons, Gabriela is seeking a loan to renovate her room so that she can improve her workshop and improve her quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1660838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to renovate her room to improve her weaving workshop so she can improve her quality of life.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-08-08T00:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-07T00:20:08Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665045962}],"funded_date":"2014-08-12T18:49:24Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:08:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":747070,"name":"Kantu De San Jeronimo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cKANTU SAN JERONIMO\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

is Rowena. Her previous loan was a big help for her buying and selling business as she was able to purchase additional merchandise like charcoal and personal products. The loan was also useful for the education of her children. Her income from the loan assisted with their everyday expenditures at home. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\n\nShe would like to apply for another 35,000 PHP loan. It will be used to buy additional stocks of charcoal needed in her business and also products like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her direct-selling. The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from this business will definitely help her to sustain her children\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\n\nRowena dreams of prospering in her businesses. She also hopes that her children will be able to complete their studies through all their hard work. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\n\n*Rowena is shown in the photo with her charcoal business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1661997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for charcoal and products like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-08-08T00:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-07T00:20:19Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rowena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":266.69,"local_amount":11666.65,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11701.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000348},{"amount":213.32,"local_amount":9333.32,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9361.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491870},{"amount":266.65,"local_amount":11666.65,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":11701.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625059},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2333.38,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2340.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535211}],"funded_date":"2014-08-08T03:49:49Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:25:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":745695,"name":"Rosanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosanna is years old 38 and married.<br \/><br \/>She earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.
