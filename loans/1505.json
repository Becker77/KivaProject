She started her businesses with the support of her husband, who is a business man and travels to other countries to bring different types of merchandise to sell. She also received the support of her mother-in-law, who makes dresses and lingerie. Julie worked at a store and was able to learn a lot about the clothing market and with the three points of view has been able to strengthen her businesses. At her store, customers find everything from school supplies to dressmaking products, lingerie, multipurpose items, etc. She sells in cash only and works everyday from 8:00 a.m. until noon and from 2:00 until 6:00 p.m. Her goals going forward are to formalize her business, improve its infrastructure by purchasing furniture and essentials, and to improve her apartment to assure her well-being.

She sincerely expresses her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nMarife hopes to improve her profit from her retail business. She also desires for her children to finish their schooling all through her hard work. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. Here she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is in a relationship and his partner is busy at home.  They have two children, so three people depend on Jose for support.\r\n\r\nJose earns a living as a farmer.  He learned how to do this from his parents because since he was a boy he went with them to the fields.  He also has a vehicle with which he can make trips.

She lives in a rural village, Kholaigram in Jalpaiguri district, with her husband and only son.\r\n\r\nHer husband, 28-year-old Sarafat, works in agriculture. He has been in this business for the last couple of years. He learned about it when he was very young, and his father taught this to him. He grows different vegetables in different seasons, and this farm work is the only source of income for the family, which is inadequate to cover all the household expenses. To earn more profit, he wants to cultivate lady's fingers (okra). Safina and her husband have chosen this as it is a vegetable which is cheap and also is widely used in rural areas. His biggest difficulty is capital for which he can't start cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn order to purchase farm supplies for the cultivation, Safina has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner). She plans to buy seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and other necessary things to start cultivation. Through this loan, she hopes, their dream will come true. She wants to work hard to get her family well and save money for the future.\r\n\r\nHer full thanks go to her generous lenders for their financial assistance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1663101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds, fertilizers and insecticides for cultivating lady's finger .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-08T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-07T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-12T21:30:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":748722,"name":"Lawrence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lawrence is a married man with six children living in Kyenjojo, Uganda.

Eross wants to thank lenders for understanding his financial situation and his loan application.\r\n\r\nEross wants to continue with his degree and do a paid internship while studying. This will help his mother with the costs of his education, and will help Eross' mother to pay for the costs of medication and treatment for Eross' younger brother, who has respiratory difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn the near future Eross would like to gain experience working for a large business.

She has a high school education and she raises livestock and grows crops as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, Kenzhetai's farm now has two horses, two cows and ten sheep, as well as a 1.20 hectare plot of land, on which she grows annual crops of clover and beans.\r\n\r\nKenzhetai's husband works as a truck driver and he actively helps her around the farm.  Their combined monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  The income from running her own business has allowed Kenzhetai to begin constructing their own home - all that is left is to build the roof and to buy windows and doors.  For this reason, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) so she can purchase and install energy-efficient plastic windows and doors, as well as cement and bricks.  Kenzhetai wants her family to live in a large, spacious and comfortable home.  She plans to expand her farming activities in the future, as she needs to save up money to make cosmetic repairs to her home and to set money aside for her eldest son's wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1490.04,"image":{"id":1667899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She also has a 2.80 hectare plot of land, where she grows .60 hectare of cabbage, .40 hectare of corn, and on the leased land she grows perennial grasses.  \r\n\r\nGulnara sells vegetables at the market and she also sells milk to the local residents.  With the goal of expanding her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy fertilizer, two bulls and to pay for the use of a hay-baling machine.  She plans to use the income from this loan to further increase her head of livestock and to save up for the purchase of a combine harvester."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1668098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two steers and fertilizer so she can increase her profits and buy a harvester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chon-Kapka village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-08-08T11:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-07T11:50:03Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":63.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":338.92,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":17747.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.83,"payment_id":561578581},{"amount":321.78,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17747.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.97,"payment_id":610751385},{"amount":332.82,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":17747.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.93,"payment_id":649513648},{"amount":317.92,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":17747.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.83,"payment_id":696500049}],"funded_date":"2014-09-05T23:04:51Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:50:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":748817,"name":"Bethel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bethel works hard to support her family.

She sells memories, culture and nostalgia. She fulfills a longing of Mexican immigrants in Dallas who want to feel connected to their childhood homes and offers artifacts from their homeland and childhood to their children or grandchildren. \r\n\r\nFor two years, Veronica has owned and operated \"Dulce Land\", which imports Mexican candy brands, such as De la Rosa, Lucas, Montes, Jovy, Azteca, and others. She packages them as mixed varieties and sells them to retailers. She sells collections of lollipops, 1-pound and 2-pound variety bags, and 5- and 10-pound pi\u00f1ata packages.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany people who are in their 30s, 40s and 50s grew up watching El Chavo de Ocho, and everybody remembers the commercials during the breaks for the brands of candy that are popular in Mexico,\u201d Veronica says. \u201cSo when they see the candy, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I haven\u2019t seen these candies since I was little.\u2019 And they\u2019ll buy the candy because it\u2019s what we knew when we were children in Mexico. What they say is that what I am really selling is nostalgia.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nostalgia business is brisk and growing for Veronica. Currently, Veronica distributes candy to a Dallas-based Latin American supermarket chain and another chain of import cash and carry stores. She says recently she contracted with another Latin American supermarket that has stores in Dallas and Austin and will be increasing her business by more than 50 percent.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so happy to be able to grow my business, and it\u2019s a business that I love,\u201d Veronica says. \u201cIt makes me so happy to know that when someone walks into a store and they buy a pi\u00f1ata and they buy a pi\u00f1ata mix, that children will be happy breaking the pi\u00f1ata and picking up my candy.\u201d\r\n\r\nVeronica sought a loan with Accion Texas so she could ramp up her business. She needed credit to make a large purchase of candy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t get this loan, I couldn\u2019t have grown my business,\u201d Veronica says.

Her husband Jerson supports her work in the fields and they have two children who are still too young to help with the business.\r\n\r\nPlanting and harvesting coffee has been a source of income for them for many years, so they are very knowledgeable. They inherited the land on which they work from their grandparents. Their customers are various intermediaries in the area who are centrally located and easily accessible. Their greatest worries include changes in the weather, and pests, like the very damaging blight and borers, which affected their fields greatly in the past year. \r\n\r\nShe requests a loan to purchase agricultural supplies so that she will be able to prevent her crops from becoming contaminated and deteriorated by the different weather changes and pests. Her and her husband's goals include their children continuing to attend school to earn a university degree so that they can support themselves in the future.

","en":"Jadgarzhan is 45 years old, a widower and the father of four lovely daughters. The two eldest, despite their young age, happily help him with his business. He has been self-employed buying, selling and repairing jewelry for over ten years. \r\n\r\nHe also bakes and sells samosa, and leases out part of his shop for hamburger sales. He makes 7,000 KGS in rent. In the clothing market he repairs clothing and sells hats. Jadgarzhan is very responsible and entrepreneurial, always looking for a new income source with which to support his beloved daughters. \r\n\r\nHowever, on the night of July 15 there was an accidental fire in his jewelry workshop which spread to the roof of the house. This impacted his main source of income and his regular customers--now his workshop stands idle. \r\n\r\nThus Jadgarzhan took a loan of 150,000 KGS from micro-finance bank, Bai-Tushum, to restore his workshop. He is an honorable man: friendly, punctual, a good communicator with strong work experience and technical knowledge. He knows how to do business and invest wisely. The income from the loan will help him restore his favorite business and provide a decent education to his daughters.

Joan is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is single and has two children, one in school. For the past two years, Joan has been working hard to manage her restaurant, which sells local cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joan has requested a loan of 950,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy charcoal, a refrigerator, and tables, and will help Joan generate greater profits and increase her capital. Joan hopes that in the future, she will be able to construct rental houses. \r\n\r\nJoan is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Agnes is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kayunga in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past two years, Agnes has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soap, sugar, posho (cornmeal), rice, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Agnes has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy soap, sugar, posho, rice, and cooking oil, and will help Agnes to generate greater profits and increase on her stock. Agnes hopes that in the future she will be able to construct rental houses. \r\n\r\nAgnes is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1663518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a 43-year-old woman. She is an energetic and active woman who lives with her husband, Aijul (aged 46 years), and their sons. Of her three sons, two attend school and are in grade five and grade ten. The eldest son does not live with them. He works abroad. They live in a small village, Baroghoria, in the district of Jalpaiguri. She and her husband both are uneducated and can sign their names only.\r\n\r\nSahima's husband is a farmer who grows paddy on his farmland. He is the only breadwinner for the family and has to cover all the necessary expenses with his income. Though Sahima is a housewife, she helps her husband in his agricultural activities.\r\n\r\nIn search of higher production, Sahima's husband has investigated how he can maximize his business, and he always arrives at the same conclusion: he needs inputs to get a better benefit from his product. This is a problem because he doesn't have the capital to buy things like compost, seeds and fertilizers, which are widely used by farmers when they want to maximize the output of their crops.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Sahima asks for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to buy those goods.

The loan will be used to buy chemicals and weaves, and will help her to generate greater profits and personal development. Miria hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nMiria is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is a very active lady who wants some extra income out of her own efforts.\n\nAmita\u2019s husband is assisting her to run the business smoothly by taking thread, blouse piece, clothes, etc. At present, her family income is Rs. 5,000 per month, which is not sufficient to maintain the family. \n\nTo improve her living condition and to earn some extra income, she wants to avail a loan from Mahashakti. From the loan amount, she will purchase a sewing machine and stitching materials in bulk quantities. She has a dream to increase her business, stitch readymade dresses, supply them to the market and educate her children in a better school.\n\nThe other three members of her group are Tilotama, Sumitra and Bulilata, who are running a saree shop, tea shop and tailoring unit respectively.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1655169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a sewing machine and stitching materials in bulk quantities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhubaneswar, Khurda, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-08-08T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-07T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tilotama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bulilata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-19T06:16:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":743447,"name":"Mahalaxmi Narayani Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lalita, the lady sitting second from right with her hand raised in the photo is a very active woman of 38 years. She resides in a small house with her five-member family in a rural village named Larka in the Nuapada district in Odisha, India.\n\nLalita has been running a general grocery shop in her small house with items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. for last 12 years. She started the business with a small investment of her own. Her monthly net income is around 4,000 INR. With this small income, it is very difficult on her part to maintain the family with the educational expenses of her children. So to expand the business for some more income, she and 12 other women of her village formed a Self Help group named Mahalaxmi Narayani to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. She will use the loan to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she replenishes her stock frequently from a distance of 15 miles away. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and with enough savings, she will be able to construct a permanent cabin for her shop, purchase a moped for easy movement of her husband and give a better education to the children. The other 12 members of the group are running cycle repair centers, fabrication units, cloth-vending and tailoring centers. \n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1654761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, and potatoes for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"LARKA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-08-08T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-07T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chandha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariyam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saikanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nirupama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sujata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ichha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Najama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rejia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":208000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":208000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":744418,"name":"Adiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adiba is a 45-year-old married mother of four, who opened a year ago a clothes selling shop to support her retired husband in covering their family's living expenses.\r\n\r\nAdiba is new in this domain, but she is working hard on developing her career properly.

Scovia is 17 years old and lives in the town of Namutumba in the Iganga region of Uganda. For the past year, Scovia has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells a local drink called malwa. \n\nTo help expand her business, Scovia has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more millet that will help her in making the local drink, and will help Scovia to generate greater profits and pay rent for her workplace. Scovia hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a restaurant. \n\nScovia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\n\n\n\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1647824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Meet Junither, a 27-year-old mother who is very hardworking, ambitious and self-motivated. She lives in the Siongiroi area of Kenya - a very remote place - but blessed with beautiful weather patterns and climate. This area is very green, making it beautiful and a place you will stay. Junither is married and has three beautiful children who she always refers to as \"her pride\u201d because they are a source of joy to her. That is why she is keen on letting them have a brighter future and a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nJunither practices mixed farming - that is, crop and animal farming - and has been doing that for the past ten years. She has all the farming techniques at her finger tips. Junither's heart is in dairy farming as she is passionate about dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows 'Keroi'.
