Meet Philip who is a 54-year-old very hardworking man, ambitious and ever smiling. He halls from the Siongiroi area of Kenya, a very remote place with good weather patterns that support farming and agricultural activities. Philip is a proud father of six children that he really loves and always refers to them as \u201chis heart beat\u201d. Philip is a very dedicated farmer and has so much experience in farming that he is touted to be among the best farmers in his village .Philip has been practicing farming for the past 13 years and through hard work, he has been able to support his family and always provides a plate of food for them. He offers free services to farmers who are still young and free extension services to farmer in the nearby villages.\r\n\r\nPhilip is seeking funds to open an agro vet shop in his village. This need arose because so many farmers have nowhere to buy animal medicine and food and Philip, being an enterprising person, wants to take advantage of the ready market that is there and make more profits. Philip is also a farmer and will benefit from the shop because he will not be going far to look for food and medicine, hence cutting down transportation costs.\r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders, Philip is confident that this loan will help aspiring farmers like him turn their dreams into reality and through the training he will get, he will be able to successfully run his agrovet shop. As Philip discloses, his determination to succeed in farming springs from the confidence that he has through his many years of farming.\r\n\r\nPhilip plans to manage his agro vet business in a professional and profitable way and through this, he will assure his family of a secure future and his family will have improved living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1663913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

It consists of four women from Sana'a, Yemen. They applied for a loan of 180,000 YER from AMB.\r\n \r\nDawla is a 25-year-old married woman and she lives with her spouse in a poor area in the capital city of Sana'a. The family lives in a very old house which is comprised of only one floor. Dawla works as a housewife and her husband is the sole breadwinner of the family. Dawla's house lacks of many home appliances and furniture. Unfortunately, the income of Dawla's husband is not enough to furnish the house and most of the furniture is old. For this reason Dawla is requesting a loan of 30,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase new furniture for the house.\r\n \r\nDawla looks forward to improving the condition of her family. She hopes to provide her family with a lot of money.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1663941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase new furniture for her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dawla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22647},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":22479},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":22479},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":22479},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":22479},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":22479},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":22479},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":22479}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.95,"local_amount":22647,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-18T09:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":22976.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529930343},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":22479,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T10:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":22806.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542422710},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":22479,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-19T10:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":22806.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561560309},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":22479,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-18T10:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":22806.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579469514},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":22479,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":22806.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595076201},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":22479,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":22806.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610478715},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":22479,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":22806.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624781231},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":22479,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":22806.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636139919}],"funded_date":"2014-08-28T05:29:16Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:20:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":749135,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is 47 years old and married with seven children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

I have now been working in this intermittently for four years.\"\r\n\r\nNelly's biggest problem is low milk production. The wet season was very short this year and did not help to increase the pasture for feeding the cows. The directly affect milk production and the daily yield is not enough to increase cheese production.

With this loan, Musa is well on his way to achieving these goals.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1668698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To access high quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed in order to double income and yield","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-08-09T11:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-08T11:30:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":16235,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16235}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.97,"local_amount":16235,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":16274.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.03,"payment_id":752024977}],"funded_date":"2014-08-17T19:20:14Z","paid_date":"2015-11-19T13:11:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":747822,"name":"Gricelda Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Griselda tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, casada y madre de dos hijos ya independientes.

As a Babban Gona member, Yohanna Mani, is excited about the opportunity to finally have access to credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Yohanna Mani can earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare,  double the National average of 14. However, Yohanna Mani is ambitious and is aiming to reap 56 bags per hectare this season due to the yield enhancing inputs that he will access with this loan.

Truphena has her secondary education, which she could not continue past because her parents could not support her, but that never killed the spirit in her to succeed in life and have a good life.\r\n\r\nShe started farming and has been doing it for the past 20 years. Through mixed farming (that is, crop and animal farming), she has been able to earn a decent income and also provide for her family.\r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to Truphena's heart and she really enjoys doing dairy farming with a lot of passion, but one challenge she is facing is lack of a proper dairy unit, so that is why she is kindly seeking funds to build a dairy unit. Through the loan, her cows will never be sick because they will have a good place to stay, and also bad weather conditions will never affect the cows. The dairy unit will boost milk production because when cows are more relaxed, they produce a lot of milk and that means improved income.\r\n\r\nTruphena is very honest with finances and she projects that through saved profits, she will be able to buy another quality dairy cow within a year. Truphena notes down all the profits she makes and takes keen interest in all the income she gets. Earlier costs that were being incurred in buying medicine will not be there, hence she will have more income and assure her family a brighter future.

However, Amina is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, she will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 35 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Amina is hopeful about what the future holds; she  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, she will finally be able to afford to educate her children: Gadafi  and Biliya. Amina\u2019s dreams do not end there: \u201cultimately, I want to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs\u201d, she expressed.

She is a mother of two lovely and adorable sons whom she really cherishes, and she will do anything in her power to fully provide for them.  She is 35 years old and was deprived of education due to her parents' poverty, so she can sign her name only. Her husband, Gobinda, who is 50 years old and has a secondary education, works as an electrician. Her sons are students of grades 4 and 6. They live in a small village Khagrabari in Jalpaiguri district.\r\n\r\nSumati's husband has no fixed income, so it is very difficult to run the family. For getting an extra income Sumati has been farming for the last few years and through these years she has been making tremendous strides in profits. Sumati\u2019s primary source of income is milk selling, and through this she has managed to earn a decent and honest income.\r\n\r\nSumati is planning to expand her business of selling milk to her neighbors and around the market. The main challenge she is facing is the inability to access funds. That is why she is kindly requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to buy a dairy cow. Through the loan, Sumati will be able to acquire more income and she will be able to secure her children's future and also improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\nSumati's plan is not only to sell her milk to the nearby market, but to be able to sell to other markets and hence increase her income and improve her living standards. She wants to provide better education to her sons so that they will become successful.\r\n\r\nShe is very much grateful to her lenders Kiva and BJS.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1663999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow for her milk supply business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-09T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-08T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-09T20:19:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":749197,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret is  married and has been blessed with seven children.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare,  double the National average of 14. However, Aisha is ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 35 bags per hectare this season due to the yield-enhancing inputs that she will access with this loan. When asked how she plans to use the money she will make from selling her produce, Aisha said \u201cI plan to use the money I make to educate my children, Friday and Saratu. Ultimately, I want to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs\u201d. With this loan, she is well on her way to achieving this dream.

Fatima lives with her family in their own house. She is an uneducated woman and she works as a housewife. She is very dynamic and vigorous. Over time her husband was able to accumulate good amount of money and purchase a piece of land. Fatima supported him with a lot of  her  own money. Her husband is the sole breadwinner of the family and his income is not enough to cover all the expenses of the household. \r\n\r\nFatima  and her husband are building their own house on that land they bought, but it is still very small and not yet completed. As a result, Fatima is requesting a loan of 40,000 YER from AMB.

Meet Irene, a 39-year-old very honest, humble and hardworking mother of one child. She hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area that has good rainfall patterns and good climatic conditions that favor farming. She lives in a village where there is no piped water or electricity connection. Irene has been doing farming for the past eight years and through profits from farming, she has been able to support her family. Irene loves dairy farming She has nicknamed one of her cows \u201cNyamatuka.\u201d She feels really proud whenever she is around her dairy cows. Although she makes profits from farming, this humble mother is faced with challenges of harvesting rain water. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank.\r\n\r\nThe loan will assist Irene to harvest rain water that is always wasted and be able to use it during dry spells to water her farm.

However, Joshua is ambitious and is aiming to reap at least 35 bags per hectare this season because with this loan, he will finally be able to access yield-enhancing inputs such as improved seeds. Joshua is hoping that as a result of this expected yield, he will finally have enough money to make significant life changes. When asked what changes he would like to make, he said \u201cI plan to use the money I make to expand my farmland.\u201d With this loan, Joshua will be able to access all the inputs and services to make these dreams reality.

Meet Hyline, a very hard-working mother who is 21 years of age. She is very ambitious and a go-getter. She hails from Nyamira area of Kenya, an area that is primarily a banana-growing region. Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs, and crop farming. Through these ventures she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. She is a mother of three, and this really motivates her to work hard so that they can have a bright future. Being raised with a humble background has taught Hyline to always be a hard worker and never to lose hope. Hyline never got any formal employment but that did not kill her morale. She started farming and has been doing it for five years.\r\n\r\nHyline is passionate about farming, but dairy farming is one aspect of the business that she enjoys most. She has always wanted to keep more quality dairy cows, but she faces financial problems. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow.\r\n\r\nHyline wants to improve her dairy farming in such a way that will bring more income because she has a large family to take care of. The quality cow will be beneficial not only to produce milk, but also to provide manure to increase productivity on her farm. Because of the good financial track record and financial discipline that Hyline has, she will be able to pay the loan on time and also improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1664128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-09T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-08T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.97,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hyline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3138.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3741.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3801.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3938.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4010.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4118.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4300.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4344.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4478.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4582.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4714.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4832.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.7},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.29,"local_amount":8285.9,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8366.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547608},{"amount":45.48,"local_amount":3954.96,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3993.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680607},{"amount":43.95,"local_amount":3821.51,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3858.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624888},{"amount":47.66,"local_amount":4144.19,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4184.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193962},{"amount":96.69,"local_amount":8407.7,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8489.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261885},{"amount":51.17,"local_amount":4449.62,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4492.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600148},{"amount":102.97,"local_amount":9012.75,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9100.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.68,"payment_id":665458771},{"amount":45.09,"local_amount":4153.06,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4193.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.67,"payment_id":696586873},{"amount":39.73,"local_amount":3770.31,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3806.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.62,"payment_id":711505097}],"funded_date":"2014-08-15T09:53:19Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":749229,"name":"Zainabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zainabu is married and has eight children, all of whom attend school.

He studies production mechanics, and he is in his last academic semester, almost ready to finish his major and graduate. He lives with his mother and his sister.  Eduardo's father passed away just two months ago, which has suddenly made him the man of the family. His mother has a small food business, which is the only support that the home has after Eduardo's mother's husband passed away. Eduardo's mother is very proud of him because he will be the first member of the family to have a university degree, something that he could not have one without the support of those who loan through Kiva. Eduardo financed his studies thanks to economic support from his father, but after his father's passing, the economic situation of his home has drastically changed.\r\n\r\nThis is why he needs the help of Kiva loaners to be able to finish his studies and begin to work to be able to help his mother with her expenses and to help his younger sister with her studies. He would like to tell the Kiva loaners that he will not fail them, that he is so close to finishing his higher education, and that very soon he will be able to pay his monthly payments. He is thankful in advance for all of the help that they can give him, trusting that he and his family will be able to get ahead.\r\n\r\nEduardo dreams of working for a big company to learn more, continue studying and to be a better professional worker so that some day he can have his own studio and teach young people like him who are eager to learn and get ahead.

Meet Janet, a 19-year-old, very hardworking, self-driven mother of four adorable children that she really loves and treasures. Janet hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area always referred as a banana growing region. Janet is very young and was raised in a challenging circumstance; for being 19 and a mother of four, she has to work even extra hard so that she can put food on the table for her large family. She has been practicing farming for the past five years, and her main source of income has been milk selling, crop farming, and some personal business so that she can make ends meet.\r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits, it\u2019s not enough.  That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to start poultry farming and boast her family and also be able to improve her standard of living. The Nyamira area has a ready market for eggs and poultry products, and she is sure that she is going to reap more profits and turn around her life.\r\n\r\nAccessing funds in Africa is very challenging, and being a mother it makes the issue challenging, but Janet feels relieved knowing that there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan Janet will be able to support her school-going children, and be able to improve her living conditions.

Meet Meshack, 55 years of age, a very energetic, hardworking and focused farmer. He hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area referred to as \u201ca banana region\u201d and their staple food is a \u201cmatoke\u201d, a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. He is a family man, and he has nine beautiful children that he really loves and adores. \r\n\r\nMeshack has a wealth of experience in farming because he has done farming for 34 years and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Meshack loves dairy farming, and has even nicknamed one of his cow \u201cNyabarati\u201d.\r\n\r\nMeshack practices mixed farming, and through that he has been able to take care of his large family, not everything has been good for this humble and hardworking man. \r\n\r\nThe Nyamira area has a ready market for poultry products and eggs, and Meshack being an enterprising person would want to take advantage of that and make profits.

Their son reads in primary level.\r\n\r\nA few years back, along with her husband Gadadhar ( 29 years old), she started a business of selling clothing (mainly sarees, a ladies'  garment) so they can establish sustainable income sources.

She has a big problem, though, which is that every business goes through hard times, and because she's a head of household who's responsible for all the expenses, she preferred feeding her children to investing in her business.\r\n\r\nShe's requesting a loan to buy 200 baby chicks to raise and concentrated feed to feed them.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a very productive company to keep on supporting her children unconditionally and having a peaceful old age.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1662715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy 200 baby chicks and concentrated chicken feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Fredonia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-08-09T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-08T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":68.73,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Amalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54599},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56122},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57688},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59298},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60952},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62653},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":64401},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66198},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68045},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69943},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71895},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73901},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75963},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78082},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80260}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.03,"local_amount":54602,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-25T09:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":56773.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531791063},{"amount":71.32,"local_amount":129665,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":134822.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542542570},{"amount":34.45,"local_amount":64995,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67580.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.3,"payment_id":561675502},{"amount":27.9,"local_amount":58650,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":60982.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.36,"payment_id":579599114},{"amount":59.49,"local_amount":126461,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":131490.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.06,"payment_id":611814645},{"amount":258.08,"local_amount":565627,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":588124.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":53.01,"payment_id":636621780}],"funded_date":"2014-08-11T03:14:54Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T11:28:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":749415,"name":"Rosana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of five children, Rosana works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fish vending business in the Philippines, and she also earns additional income from pig fattening.

Tired of the monotony of being a housewife, one day she looked for a way to generate income and found an entity which trained her to sew clothes using a machine.\r\n\r\nWith the help of seven loans from the organization, and with a good payment record for all,  Ana succeeded in starting her own workshop for sewing in her home with the help of relatives, as we see in the photo.

She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan. It will be used to buy additional supplies and merchandise such as clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics. The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. Having more items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from this business will definitely help her to sustain her children\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMargery hopes that her business will continue to prosper because she desires to have her own boutique. She also dreams of protection and happiness for her family. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

a married adult with three minor children. She is from Chinandega, located in the western part of the country. This area is characterized by its commercial productivity. She is a micro-businesswoman and runs her own businesses, which are selling grocery products for daily consumption, such as basic grains, soap, sodas, ice, etc., as well as making and selling tortillas. She has 8 years' experience in both activities. Her main customers are the nearby residents. Her sales are 100% paid for up front. She pays for her purchases up front in the markets and a distributor in her community. She started these businesses with her own money from her savings when she was seeking a way to be able to help with the household expenses. Her daily schedule starts the night before, grinding the corn, which she does three times. She also has her store. One of her dreams is to finish building her house and see her children graduate from college and improve her profits. Lilliam is characterized as being a hardworking, responsible, honorable woman who really wants to get ahead personally.  Today she is asking for a loan for working capital to invest in her businesses by buying basic grains, sodas, snacks, etc. She will also invest in ingredients for selling tortillas, such as corn, lime, firewood and more.\r\n\r\nWhen her business grows, she can buy at better prices and stock everything she can't have of the most in demand products so she can make more income and offer better prices to her customers.

Introducing Phane, a 25-year-old mother who is full of energy and a very hard worker. She hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area with good and favourable weather patterns that support farming. She is the mother of two children who are under her care from her marriage. Phane completed her secondary school education thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. \r\n\r\nPhane has been farming for the past six years and through mixed farming, she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows 'Moraa' (from a person's name). Although Phane passionately loves farming, she faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank.\r\n\r\nPhane comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will assist her to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also store water for home consumption. Harvested water will assist Phane to irrigate her farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops. This loan will turn around the life of Phane as she will no longer have to walk for long distances in search of water, hence saving her time.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1664532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-10T02:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-09T02:20:08Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1256.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1481.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1536.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1562.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1648.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1692.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1762.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1838.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1883.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1935.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.29,"local_amount":3063.5,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3362.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530054411},{"amount":38.36,"local_amount":3068.58,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3367.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680611},{"amount":20.18,"local_amount":1614.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193966},{"amount":42.81,"local_amount":3424.99,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3758.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823403},{"amount":21.74,"local_amount":1739.14,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1908.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264021},{"amount":22.84,"local_amount":1827.49,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2005.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600152},{"amount":23.13,"local_amount":1862.81,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2044.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.16,"payment_id":665458773},{"amount":22.61,"local_amount":1902.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2088.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.17,"payment_id":681377016},{"amount":17.67,"local_amount":1496.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1642.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.04,"payment_id":696586875}],"funded_date":"2014-08-10T03:27:06Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Lush","image":null}},{"id":749510,"name":"Sidi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sidi is a single mother of five school-going children.

Daudi passionately loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of his cows \u201cnyamutuki.\" Although he makes profits from dairy farming he has the challenge of not having a proper dairy unit, which is why he is kindly requesting a loan to construct a modern dairy unit.\r\n\r\nDairy cows require proper care so that they can produce higher volumes of milk and they also require a proper place for them to rest so that they are not affected by bad weather conditions. Through the loan Daudi will be able to improve his milk production because he will have a good place to milk his cows and reduce the chance of sickness. Hence, he will save more money that would have been spent on buying animal medicine. This loan will assist David to collect cow dung that will be used to improve vegetable production on his farm, and he can also use the cow dung to make his hut look beautiful.\r\n\r\nDaudi has a good culture of saving.

Introducing you to Peter, a 34-year-old honest, hard-working and ever-smiling father of two adorable children. He hails from  Nyamira in Kenya, a banana-growing area where the staple food is \u201cmatoke\u201d, a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. Peter has been involved in farming for the past 14 years and he owns dairy cows that produce milk for sale. Besides his dairy cows, he also keeps poultry and when you visit his farm you will witness tea growing as well as a variety of vegetables.\r\n.\r\nPeter has a passion for dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cNyaera\u201d (from a person's name) but all is not well for this humble man. He is facing the challenge of the lack of a proper dairy unit which is why he is seeking funds to construct a proper dairy unit. With your loan, he will be able to better manage his dairy farm and create more value. A better dairy unit will assist Peter to save more money because his cows will never be sick and this will also boost his dairy's milk production. \r\n\r\nThrough building a dairy unit with the loan, Peter will be able to collect the cows' by-products, namely, cow dung and urine which can be sold or better yet used on his farm. With a dairy unit, he will be able to better feed his animals and collect by-products such as dung to generate biogas fuel, make organic fertilizer and plaster his hut. The money that he will earn from the dairy unit will be reinvested back into the business to create growth.\r\n\r\nPeter is a very ambitious man and he projects that through the loan he will have higher quality dairy cows and be able to permanently change his living conditions and secure his children's future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1664641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-10T08:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-09T08:40:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4079.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4863.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4941.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5119.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5213.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5590.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5648.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5821.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5957.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6128.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6282.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":136.65,"local_amount":11843.34,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":12004.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547613},{"amount":56.88,"local_amount":4929.36,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4996.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680613},{"amount":55.11,"local_amount":4776.47,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4841.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624893},{"amount":62.8,"local_amount":5442.71,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5516.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193968},{"amount":127.43,"local_amount":11043.69,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":11194.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261890},{"amount":135.02,"local_amount":11701.45,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11861.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600154},{"amount":167.5,"local_amount":15262.98,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":15471.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.61,"payment_id":681377018}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T01:17:22Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":749586,"name":"Tomasa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tomasa is 62 years old and has 10 children.

It consists of women who have developed a great team spirit after five loan cycles, reinforced by strong family ties from all living in the same village.  They are very involved in the growth of their income-generating businesses, especially centered \r\non small business and seasonal farming during the rainy season. Ms. Bacary, age 31, sitting at the far right of the photo with her hand raised, is the representative of this group.  She is married and mother of five children, three boys and two girls, ages 2 to 13.  She runs her own food store in the village where she sells rice, sugar, oil, tea, milk, condiments, cafe, cookies, candies, and other consumer products. She buys her supplies in bulk and half-bulk at the communal market for resale in her village.
