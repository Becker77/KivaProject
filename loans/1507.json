She needed money for the education of their three children. She looked for a solution to increase their income and provide for her children\u2019s education. Because her husband wouldn\u2019t give her permission to work, she considered jobs she could do from home. She decided to make and sell manti, traditional Turkish ravioli, with a friend. \r\n\r\nThey began making manti at home with the friend\u2019s sister as well. When they first started they sold to their friends and neighbors. After a disagreement, Emine decided to separate from her partners and start her own shop. This time she began working on her own. She spent weeks making contacts at large markets to sell her products. When she had problems with capital in 2004, she learned about Maya and took out a loan. She has begun working with her son and his wife to develop the business, which is expanding. She takes out a loan each year and has bought a machine to cut dough, an oven and other appliances to increase productivity. \r\n\r\nEmine now provides jobs for 15 housewives. All three of her children have completed university.This year she will use the loan from Maya to buy flour and onions. \u201cIn expanding, working with help from Maya has been a great pleasure for me,\u201d she says. She wants to expand her business even more and open a big manti store and run it like a restaurant. She has also begun working to patent her manti.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n\r\nEmine Han\u0131m e\u015fi emekli olunca ekonomik s\u0131k\u0131nt\u0131 i\u00e7ene

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nGlenda hopes that her business will continue to flourish and that she will be able to buy another tricycle unit. She meets up with her co-fellowship members weekly to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay for micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1524065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

The above picture presents to you a 40-year-old woman who is very hardworking and very passionate about farming, a mother of four lovely children. She hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, a region known for growing bananas. Esther was raised in challenging circumstances and her basic needs were never covered, so she vowed she would turn her life around and live a comfortable life. That is why she started mixed farming, and she has been farming for the past 14 years. Through dedication, hard work and commitment, she has been able to provide for the basic needs of her family. Although she makes some profit, she has the challenge of inadequate water for irrigating her crops and even for her home consumption. \r\nMost of the rain water is wasted, and Esther wants to harvest that water. That is why she is kindly requesting a loan to buy a water tank. The Nyamira area has no piped water, and this means that you have to travel for long distances in such of \u201cthis precious commodity.\u201d But, with the loan, she will be able to store water for home consumption. The loan will also help Esther irrigate her farm.  She plans to use the sprinkle irrigation method, so that there will be a high production level on her farm. Esther always says \u201cWater is a very precious commodity and should not go to waste\u201d. Having access to funds is very challenging for African women, but with partners such as Kiva and Juhudi Kilimo, Esther is sure that her dreams will become a reality and she will be able to improve her living conditions.

Her purchases are made in cash from wholesalers and wholesaler trucks that offer their products at the door of her home.

He had the chance to study computer science, but unfortunately he couldn't benefit from working in this domain, since Palestinians have limited access to several working sectors in Lebanon.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Mohamad decided to help his father in his business and get the necessary experience and talent in this domain in order to start his own business and expand it in a well-managed way. Mohamad has 18 years of experience in the following areas: selling and fixing new and used van spare parts, fixing the necessary mechanical needs of vans, and renting vans when requested. He used this business experience from his father to start his own business in October 2009. Today, he has three employees, who work hard to help him in replying to his increasing number of customers. His workshop is located in a very attracting location, next to the regional parking for vans and buses. Because he is the only person in the region who provides such services, he has to make sure that he is always capable of replying to different customers' needs.\r\n\r\nMohamad developed his business properly. He started in the retail business and added maintenance services in order to provide his customers with everything they need at the same place, to save time. Today, Mohamad is working hard on developing his business properly, through an acquired loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua. Through this acquired loan, he will buy 12 car engines made in Korea, specialized for the vans he works on, in order to provide the necessary maintenance they need.\r\n\r\nHis mechanical capabilities were developed gradually. At the beginning, he only had one car lifter, which he used to make his work easier, until he bought the necessary tools requested for this business. Today, he owns his work place from the net profit he received through this business. He received weekly installments and now, his business capital is around $100,000. He hopes to keep on developing his business in a well-managed way, to make sure that he can provide his beloved family the necessary standards of living they need, especially now that his wife is pregnant with their first expected baby.

Also, there has been a low production of milk. But, through this loan Joshua will be able to save more money, that was used for medicine, and also his cow will produce the maximum amount of milk.\r\nThe dairy unit will be beneficial because Joshua will be able to collect cow dung that he will use in his farm, hence increasing productivity and also aiding in plastering his mud hut.

With financial support from his father and some of his friends, Moneer was able to open a call center. In order to improve his center, Moneer also sells phones, phone accessories, and phone card recharges because he realizes this business will be profitable due to a new settlement area.

Unfortunately, he doesn't have enough money to do that. As a result, he applied for a loan of 150,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more phones, accessories, and phone card recharges for his center to strengthen his business more.

Her family comprises her two children (one son and two daughters). Her daughter is a student of grade ten. They live in a small village, Baroghoria, in the district of Jalpaiguri. She is an illiterate woman who can only sign her name.\r\n\r\nAfter her husband's sudden death, Saradini's son was compelled to become involved in their family business of cultivating seasonal vegetables. Saradini looks after her children and manages household work and simultaneously helps her son in his agricultural activities. She carries the vegetables to the local market for sale. She and her son have been in this activity for quite a few years and gained experience about cultivation. Their present income is insufficient for their family\u2019s expenses. So, she and her son have decided to grow paddy, which is a profitable crop for cultivation, on their farmland, but she faces problems of limited capital.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, Saradini is asking for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to purchase agricultural inputs such as paddy seeds, manure etc. She wants to start cultivation as soon as possible, preferably in this rainy season, and hopes to earn good revenue to give a healthy living to her children. In the future, she wants to purchase a plot of land with the profit generated from this business. \r\n\r\nShe conveys her hearty thanks to her generous lenders, BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1664893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase paddy seeds and fertilizers for cultivating paddy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-10T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-09T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saradini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-12T21:50:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":748768,"name":"G.s Luchando Por La Vida Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Vilma es una mujer  emprendedora y dedicada a su negocio propio que es venta de productos por cat\u00e1logo Avon y Arabela desde hace 5  a\u00f1os, este negocio lo atiende de forma ambulante contando con los clientes principales del municipio y otras personas que viven en diferentes aldeas.\nDo\u00f1a Vilma tambi\u00e9n atiende este negocio en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n,  muy conocida en el municipio y es por eso que llegan hasta su casa para comprar el producto, tambi\u00e9n cuenta con la venta de granos b\u00e1sicos ma\u00edz y frijoles, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de lociones, perfumes, cremas, champo, talcos, ma\u00edz y frijoles para su segundo negocio.

Meet Malack, a 34-year-old man who lives with his spouse and their child in the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area with wonderful weather patterns. \r\n\r\nMalack is very hard working and has fought to raise his child and his family alone since his wife does not have a job. He practices mixed farming (that is, crop and dairy farming) and has been able to sell the fruits of his labour to the markets within his area. Malack has been farming for the last 6 years and through all these years he has gathered so much experience.  All farming techniques are at his \u201cfingertips\u201d.\r\n\r\nAlthough Malack has been making profits, he has a challenge irrigating his farm during dry spells and sometimes he suffers loses, so that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a water tank. The Nyamira area has no piped water, so through the loan he will be able to harvest rain water to be used by the family for home consumption, hence reducing the time spent going to look for water. The water tank will be of much help because Malack will be able to store rain water that always goes to waste and store it for future use so during dry spells he will have water to irrigate his farm.\r\n\r\nMalack plans to use drip irrigation on his farm and this water tank will be of much help. As Malack says, \u201cwater is a precious commodity\u201d. Malack had almost lost hope of buying a good quality water tank but, because of good partners like Kiva, he believes his dream will be a reality and he will improve his living conditions through improved crop production and having clean water for consumption by his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1664994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-10T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-09T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2824.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3421.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3544.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3609.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3706.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3870.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3910.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4030.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4124.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4242.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4349.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.46,"local_amount":8010.8,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8210.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547618},{"amount":39.75,"local_amount":3407.07,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3491.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680617},{"amount":38.88,"local_amount":3332.84,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3415.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624897},{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":3763.94,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3857.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193974},{"amount":89.09,"local_amount":7636.08,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7826.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261895},{"amount":94.39,"local_amount":8090.94,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":8292.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600160},{"amount":119.38,"local_amount":10758.33,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":11026.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.14,"payment_id":681377024}],"funded_date":"2014-08-15T01:59:35Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":749852,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a hardworking man aged 44 years and happily married with 3 children.\r\n\r\nHe grew up in a very humble family which had little assets and even without school fees to educate him.

The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank's \u201cMayas\u201d Group was formed here by seven Maya Tzutujil ladies who are seeking to create better lives for themselves, their families and their community. They are pleased to be able to participate in Friendship Bridge's \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program that combines small loans and education. The Trust Bank's \u201cMayas\u201d Group is beginning its second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and the very first one with Kiva!\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda is a hard-working member of the group. She is 45 years old and married with six children. Her youngest child lives with her and is just beginning his formal education. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda is quite motivated to provide him with everything that he needs. She has a textile business and sells her traditional blouses, belts and aprons in three nearby locations. The loan that she is requesting will enable her to purchase supplies for her business including fabric, ribbon, buttons, thread and needles. Her business is growing and is proving increasingly profitable.\r\n \r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank are happy to have just welcomed a new member to the group. The new member is very enthusiastic about Friendship Bridge's educational program. A Loan Officer from the organization attends the monthly meetings and facilitates the educational portion of the meeting. The program has been designed to strengthen the women with new knowledge about a variety of relevant subjects including women\u2019s rights, self esteem and violence against women as well as hygiene, health and nutrition. The women also learn about the use of medicinal plants. To assist them in successfully managing their loans, they learn about accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing and pricing.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank's \u201cMayas\u201d Group is anxious to begin their new loan cycle. They are full of hopes and dreams. Kiva investors play a prominent role in the success of these women. Thank you, Kiva investors for your compassion and generosity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":1665259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase supplies for her textile business including fabric, ribbon, buttons, thread and needles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro la Laguna, Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.683333 -91.266667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T00:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T00:10:01Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cruz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Esthela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":20700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2588.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2588.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2588.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2588.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2588.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2588.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2588.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2578.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":334.55,"local_amount":2588.8,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542515581},{"amount":334.55,"local_amount":2588.8,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649118},{"amount":334.54,"local_amount":2588.8,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579563969},{"amount":334.54,"local_amount":2588.8,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595161348},{"amount":334.54,"local_amount":2588.8,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610557872},{"amount":334.54,"local_amount":2588.8,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231012},{"amount":334.54,"local_amount":2588.8,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216743},{"amount":333.2,"local_amount":2578.4,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2599.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649566946}],"funded_date":"2014-08-26T15:25:57Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:36:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":749993,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"From Prey Chhor District, Kampong Cham Province, Mom, 49, is an experienced and industrious farmer.

Their economy is based on agriculture, animal husbandry and traditional textile production. Fruit produced from this fertile area includes peaches, pears, plums and apples.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank's \u201cVentura\u201d Group was formed some time ago by 10 women who want to improve their standard of living and eliminate poverty in their lives. They are dedicated to their businesses and motivated to help support their families. The President of the Trust Bank is 32-year-old Manuela. She is married and has nine children. Manuela is quite pleased that five of them are in school as she understands the importance of education. She works hard two days each week selling chickens when the large local market is held. Her earnings enable her to support her nuclear family. Manuela is requesting a new loan in order to purchase additional chickens so she can expand her clientele. She is also looking forward to increased earnings.\r\n\r\nThe educational training sessions that are part of the monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer are of great use to the women. The ladies enjoy learning and discussing topics like business administration and money management, women\u2019s identity and leadership as well as self esteem. They learn a lot during this training and also from the experiences and opinions of their friends in the Trust Bank. Friendship Bridge has given the name \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d to this combination of loans and education. It is a partnership that yields very positive results for the women.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank's \u201cVentura\u201d Group thank each Kiva investor who enables them to have access to a microcredit loan which not only benefits them and their families but also their community in Chichicastenango. Empowered with small loans and education, they step into a brighter future with confidence and determination.

Since his loan payments would be less than what he currently pays for school, he would be able to make the payments with what he will earn at his job working part-time, and he could continue studying.\n\nVladimir is confident that yet again he can come out ahead of this difficult moment as he has done in other situations.

aged 49, is a very hard-working man. For financial reasons, he wasn't able to continue attending school: he only managed to finish the second year of basic education. Joey is married and his wife runs a store and takes care of the home. He has children.\r\n\r\nJoey has always worked in agriculture, both on his own and for others.

Chuka area is one of the regions that is populated and has a high demand for cereals.  That means that Florence will make more profits and be able to satisfy the demand that is there.\r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Florence, but she feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing.  Florence believes that this loan will be of much help and she will be able to satisfy the demand that is there for cereals and she believes that the extra income will allow permanent change to her life and increase her business.\r\n\r\nIncreased profits will allow Florence to repay back the loan and secure the future of her school going children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1665631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T11:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T11:50:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.94,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1835.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2300.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2329.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2421.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2457.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2659.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2663.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2753.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2809.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2898.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2963.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3130.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3209.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.18},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.99,"local_amount":6483.07,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6763.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547619},{"amount":35.39,"local_amount":2980.54,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3109.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680618},{"amount":38.68,"local_amount":3256.95,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3397.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624898},{"amount":39.62,"local_amount":3336.2,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3480.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193975},{"amount":122.92,"local_amount":10350.82,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10798.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264024},{"amount":152.46,"local_amount":13592.42,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14179.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.94,"payment_id":696586879}],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T19:44:20Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":750122,"name":"Mila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mila is a widowed mother of four children.

She hails from the Chuka area of Kenya, an area that is at the slopes of the famous Mount Kenya. \r\n\r\nIdah is a very dedicated farmer who does farming with a lot of passion and has been practicing mixed farming for the past 12 years. Through those years, she has raised her family by providing for them the basic needs they require. Her primary sources of income are eggs, milk and a small personal business that she does to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nIdah loves dairy farming, and an animal on her farm has been given the name of Gatune (from a person\u2019s name). Her biggest challenge in farming has been a lack of funds to increase her business.\r\n\r\nIdah is seeking a loan to buy cereals to be able to sell them to the nearby market and to her neighbors. The Chuka area has a high population, and the demand for cereals has been so high, but the supply is low; that is why Idah, who is having an entrepreneur's mind, wants to take advantage of the ready market and be able to make more profits.\r\n\r\nIdah is very visionary, and she plans that through the increased income from selling cereals, she will allow permanent change of her life and increase her business to other markets.\r\n\r\nIdah has gone through training from Juhudi Kilimo, and she is more disciplined with finances. She hopes that through accumulated profits, she will pay back the loan and improve her living conditions permanently. Idah waits for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1665721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T13:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T13:50:05Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.41,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1606.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2013.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2038.43},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2118.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2150.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2208.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2327.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2330.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2409.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2536.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2592.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2662.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2739.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2808.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.83,"local_amount":5672.69,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5700.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547620},{"amount":29.81,"local_amount":2607.97,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680619},{"amount":32.57,"local_amount":2849.83,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2863.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624899},{"amount":33.36,"local_amount":2919.18,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2933.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193976},{"amount":103.51,"local_amount":9056.97,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9101.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264025},{"amount":128.51,"local_amount":11893.36,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":11952,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.41,"payment_id":696586880}],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T19:22:55Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":750208,"name":"Naim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naim was born in 1988, has intermediate level of education, and is married and has one child.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, he started working as a furniture painter, and his income wasn\u2019t enough to cover his family\u2019s expenses.

They mostly live in traditional families in Dogoni, a commune in the area of Sikasso, the third largest administrative region in Mali.  They work with the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso to better carry out their agricultural activities during the rainy season.  They are on their fifth loan for the production of corn.  The previous loans were all fully repaid.  Mr. Seydou, who is standing at the far right of the photo, grows corn.  With his loan, he plans to buy eight 50-kg bags fertilizer, 10 containers of different quality herbicide, and to pay the labor costs of maintaining one hectare of land.  After the harvest, the output is sold at the village level in Sikasso to a clientele of men and women for cash and credit.  Mr. Seydou expects to earn an average profit of 160,000 FCFA per season.  This profit will allow him to repay his loan and interest as well as contribute to his family's daily expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1664766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertilizer and to pay for labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Dogoni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karamoko","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lassina ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seydou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":750233,"name":"Thu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thu, 36, lives in a small house in Ho Chi Minh City with two daughters and her husband, who is a driver for hire.\r\n\r\nShe earns an income running a general store in front of her house.

He had never taken out a loan before with state banks, but FUDECOSUR has provided him with a loan with better terms and a much lower interest rate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1664209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase fertilizers and fungicides, and to pay for manual labor for cultivation tasks ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Oratorio, Platanarares, Perez zeledon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T16:30:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ju\u00e1n Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2017-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":794.69,"local_amount":429560.07,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-20T09:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":429647.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231348},{"amount":1.62,"local_amount":877.82,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":878,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665436380},{"amount":128.69,"local_amount":69562.11,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":69576.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696557719}],"funded_date":"2014-08-31T20:39:08Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:50:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":750246,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello! Meet Mary, 54 years of age. She is a very dedicated and hard-working woman who is a mother of four lovely children. She resides in the Kitale area of Kenya, a region always referred to as the 'bread basket region' of Kenya because half the food that Kenya consumes comes from that region. She has four lovely and adorable school-going children that she really values and treasures and she always refers to them as 'her heartbeat.'\r\n\r\nMary has been practicing farming for the past 15 years and, through hard work and determination, she has been able to support her family and always provide a plate of food for them. Her main sources of income are milk, crops, and some small, personal business that she does to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nBecause of the harsh living conditions and the lack of employment, Mary plans to increase her farming output, so that she can improve her income and, hence, her living conditions. That is why she is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 (Kenya shillings) to buy farm inputs. Through buying farming inputs, such as good quality seeds and good fertilizer and pesticide, she will be able to increase her crop production output and, hence, improve her income.\r\n\r\nMary is very visionary and enterprising and she hopes that, through improved income, she will be able to save more money and she plans to buy more land and increase her farming in the future.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, her business will continue to flourish and she will assure her school-going children of uninterrupted learning because she will pay tuition fees on-time and also improve her living standards.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1665802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm inputs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T16:30:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1882.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2244.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2280.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2362.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2406.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2470.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2580.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2606.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2686.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2749.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2828.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2899.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.86,"local_amount":4788.04,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4911.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547621},{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":2213.14,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2270.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680620},{"amount":28.47,"local_amount":2440.36,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624900},{"amount":28.96,"local_amount":2481.89,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2546.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193977},{"amount":210.89,"local_amount":18076.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":18544.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261896}],"funded_date":"2014-08-12T02:25:29Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":750248,"name":"Margie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margie, 41 years old, is married and has eight children, three currently in school.
