Beatrice is the mother of three children and has been involved in mixed farming--that is, planting various varieties of food crops and keeping dairy cows--for the past five years. Although Beatrice makes profits from farming, her crop production is so low and her profit margins are very thin because she lacks good farm inputs. That is why she is gratefully seeking a loan to buy farm inputs.\r\n\r\nBeatrice is determined to solve this situation by buying good quality seeds, fertilizers and pesticides to be used in increasing her crop production. Through the loan Beatrice is going to improve her income level and she will assure her children of a bright and secure future. Beatrice is very visionary, and she projects that with her improved income she will be able to open a shop where she will sell cereals from her farm, and through the accumulated profits, her business will flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1665891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1520.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1546.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1663.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1675.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1728.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1820.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1914.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.26,"local_amount":4740.72,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5210.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680621},{"amount":19.2,"local_amount":1535.87,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1688.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624901},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":1666.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1831.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193978},{"amount":150.71,"local_amount":12057.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":13252.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264026}],"funded_date":"2014-08-13T18:03:59Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":750297,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is a single young man, born in 1996.

Justine is 23 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has 3 children who are all currently in school. For the past 2 years Justine has been working hard to manage her small retail business, which sells food and vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

She is married and has two children. For the past three years Prossy has been working hard to manage her small retail business, which sells soft drinks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prossy has requested a loan of 950,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more soda and water for sale, and will help Prossy to generate greater profits and improve on her family's standards of living. Prossy hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nProssy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1666097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Patience is 16 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda; she is wearing a sleeveless white blouse in the picture. For the past year, Patience has been working hard to manage her clothing business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Patience has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more different types of clothes for resale, and will help Patience to generate greater profits and pay school tuition for herself. Patience hopes that in the future  will be able to increase her capital. \r\n\r\nPatience is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Her whole life she was an employee with big responsibilities, like supporting two children, ages 17 and 12. But from every paycheck she always saves a small amount because she dreamed of being independent, and that is how over time she managed to buy two sewing machines and she opened her shop. Today, and with the help of another three loans, she has managed to set up a good sewing shop that has seven employees, all of them mothers and heads of household.\r\n\r\nShe has a big problem and that is unfair competition by her competitors.

Meet Nancy, 29 years of age and a small-scale farmer from Kericho, a rural town in Kenya that is famous for its high-quality tea. It is also home to some of the world\u2019s best long-distance runners, many of whom have won gold medals in international events. Nancy is a young mother of one child and has been practising mixed farming for the past four years. Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs, tea and other crops, and some personal business.\r\n\r\nNancy passionately loves farming, but dairy farming is close to her heart and looking after her dairy cows makes her a very proud farmer. Although Nancy has made profits through farming, she has been experiencing losses because of ineffective farming techniques. That is why she is kindly requesting a loan to buy farm inputs.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will be able to buy good-quality and high-grade seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides to be used in her farm. This will assure her of immediate profits because the production level will go up, which will generate better profits.\r\n\r\nModern farming requires the use of modern techniques and inputs, and Nancy is eager to access them. Through increased profits, she will be able to realize her dream of improving her living conditions and seeing her business expand in leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nNancy is very disciplined with finances and has gone through Juhudi Kilimo training. She is sure to accumulate more income and be able to fully pay back the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1666167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy good-quality and high-grade seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1520.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1546.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1663.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1675.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1728.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1820.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1914.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.26,"local_amount":4740.72,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5210.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680623},{"amount":19.2,"local_amount":1535.87,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1688.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624903},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":1666.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1831.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193980},{"amount":64.49,"local_amount":5159.17,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5670.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264028},{"amount":66.48,"local_amount":5587.23,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6141.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.36,"payment_id":681377026},{"amount":15.35,"local_amount":1310.94,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1440.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":731022051}],"funded_date":"2014-08-12T00:10:10Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":750394,"name":"Cissy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cissy is 18 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.

The above picture presents to you Abraham, a very hardworking person who is 36 years of age, who hails from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area referred by many as the bread basket area of Kenya. He is a family man and has five children that he really adores and you can always notice a pleasant feeling when he arrives home from the farm. He has been practicing mixed farming for over five years and through milk selling, crop selling, and personal business he has been able to earn a decent income. Abraham loves farming but dairy farming is passionately close to his heart. He has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cMaua,\u201d which means flower, and that\u2019s really what the cow is to him. Abraham has been selling milk to his neighbors and villagers but the demand has been too big for him to satisfy, which is why he is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good quality cow that can produce more milk.\r\n\r\nAbraham has large space in his farm and also animal food will never be a problem and is therefore assured of reaping maximum profits through milk selling. Through the loan Abraham will be assured of immediate profits because the demand for milk is high and profits from it will be used in improving his living conditions and paying tuition fees to his school-going children.\r\n\r\nAbraham is an aspiring farmer, and through partners such as Kiva he is sure of making his dream come into a reality through their loan financing. Abraham waits for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1666195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-11T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-10T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2334.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2372.15},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2457.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2502.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2569.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2683.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2711.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2794.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2859.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2941.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3015.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.7,"local_amount":4966.79,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5249.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547623},{"amount":27.67,"local_amount":2302.08,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2432.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680624},{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":2517.68,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2660.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624904},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":2560.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2705.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193981},{"amount":63.05,"local_amount":5246.06,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5544.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261898},{"amount":163.55,"local_amount":13607.05,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":14380.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600162}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T21:47:31Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":750393,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is married with one child who attends school.

Once she gets the amount she needs, she goes back to her shop where she puts together the wool to turn it into a thin thread and weave it into llama wool blankets.

So far, it is almost thirty years for them as farmers. The earnings that this couple can generate are $10 USD a day. \r\n\r\nHon would like to improve her living standard by having clean energy for household use. Because of the lack of capital, she is asking for a Kiva loan to build a small biogas digester under the project of NBP (National Biogas Program) in partnering with HKL.

They live mainly in traditional families in Loutana, a village in the township of Kleladogoni in the district of Sikasso, the third administrative region of Mali. They collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to successfully manage their agricultural businesses during the rainy season. They are on their seventh Soro Yiriwaso agricultural loan for growing corn. Their prior loans have been duly repaid. They grow corn, which is what Mr. Moussa S, does for example. He is the first one seated from right to left in the group photo. With his loan, he plans to buy eight 50-kg [110 lbs] of fertilizers, 10 jugs of herbicides of various quality grades and pay the cost of labor to work 1 ha [2 acres] of land. After harvesting, he sells his produce in his village and in Sikasso, to a mixed clientele, for cash and on credit. He plans to earn an average of 160,000 West African francs per agricultural cycle. This revenue will allow him to pay off his loan with interest and also contribute to the everyday family needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":1664854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for fertilizers and cost of labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Loutana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-12T15:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-11T15:40:01Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":330.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Issouf ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalidou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdoul K","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussa S ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1250000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2244.42,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-24T11:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1258618.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":330.58,"payment_id":636515416}],"funded_date":"2014-09-11T13:36:05Z","paid_date":"2015-04-24T11:02:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":750758,"name":"Aya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aya is an 18 year-old single young lady from Nablus city.

She has been operating her own variety store and canteen for years, and she profits well from this. Perina also owns and operates a computer shop and apartment business. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Perina earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Perina would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. An amount of 20,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos) would enable her to purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. Perina could also improve her profit from her canteen, computer shop and apartment business with the help of this loan. She sincerely offers you her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Perina hopes to have more sets of computers for her business. She dreams for her family to always be happy and healthy. Perina meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\nPerina is shown in the photo in her grocery

They are the ones who are concerned with the wellbeing of their children and the family's economic situation. This is true in the case of 45-year-old Josefa, who has to look after her four children who are her motivation to get up every morning and fight to make a living to improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nHer job involves buying and selling stock for grocery stores in her community and it is through doing this that she is able to make an income. Five years ago her husband told her that you can make a good income doing this kind of business and so she took the initiative. The other work she does is in an agricultural supplies store which is also in her community. She has found a big business opportunity because she has customers and doesn't have any other competition in this field. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy stock for her general store so she can have a range of goods on sale.\r\n\r\nHer personal goals in the next few years, depending on the profit she makes, are to expand her business, buy more land for her children and give them an education so they can become professionals.

Aneth has a food business where she cooks soup, tea with snacks and lunch food, and sells soft drinks, sodas, water and juices.

Aneth works from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.\r\n\r\nAneth is now approaching Tujijenge for her more than tenth loan cycle. She has been with Tujijenge since 2011, taking various credits. Aneth has managed to repay all loans successfully. Her business now looks better than before and she is so proud of Kiva lenders' support, which has made a great change to her life. She used the previous credits to buy more food cooking ingredients (rice, cooking oil, sugar, maize and baking flour) which she normally keeps in her store and then takes what she needs, little by little. By doing this, she is sure to maintain her business needs and see a good return. Aneth bought a fridge which is now defective. She needs to buy a new one and replace other defective business equipment, such as chairs, tables and charcoal cooking stoves. Aneth will invest her new loan in buying a new business fridge and cooking ingredients. Her dream is to open another big branch. \r\n\r\nAneth will share this credit with UNITY's other two members, and they will all hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

She is 51 years old and currently resides with her family in Taguig City, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than twenty years, and she profits well from this. She also manages a house rental business which helps with their everyday expenses. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner have to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Cecilia would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 15,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Cecilia hopes to have more rooms for rent. She dreams that her children will complete their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1666810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She also hopes that her daughter will have the education necessary to be able to have greater opportunity in life.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras \u2013 July, 2014\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1665311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, shortening, beans, cheese, milk, eggs, bread, etc., for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2014-08-12T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-11T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iris Milady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542646908},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T14:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561781515},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T14:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579738763},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595306621},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610698016},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624381913},{"amount":64.69,"local_amount":1350,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1351.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636737002},{"amount":165.31,"local_amount":3450,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:17:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3454.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649720374}],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T15:56:36Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T15:17:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":750807,"name":"Loreta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loreta, 31 years old, is married and has three children, who are in school.

From a young age, he liked to be around his parents' livestock, which taught him to take care of them, and it was also there that the desire to be a cattle trader was born in him. Now he has been making a living in the business for more than five years. He is also a farmer. He works the land, sewing grass for his cattle to graze in. He fattens them and then sells them, thus earning his main source of income.\r\n\r\nHe has oxen and a cart and plow with which he works the land to obtain his crops and pastures for his animals. The lands that he works belong to his mother, and he manages them. They are two kilometers away from him, a distance that he walks or rides a horse. His work schedule is from 6am to 4pm. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used for the livestock business, since it is constantly needing work capital to be able to continue. He is thinking of buying five calves to fatten and then sell, and with that have earnings. The need filled is that of being able to have capital to be able to work. His dreams for the future are to be able to have his own lands, in order to have his belongings and become independent from his parents little by little. Also, when he is old enough and mature enough, he dreams of having his own family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1055.31,"image":{"id":1665313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy five calves to fatten and later sell, and with that have earnings.

His youngest son helps him around the farm. He is retired and his main source of income comes from livestock, crops, and beekeeping. He started his farm in 1992 with 3,000 som (KGS) and currently has three cows, two calves, and 50 boxes of bee colonies. In spite of his age, Karynchi is full of strength and energy to develop his business and do the work he loves. He currently earns 4,000 som (KGS) per month, which is a disastrously low income. In order to expand his business Karynchi applied for a loan with the Bai-Tushum Bank in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) in order to buy calves and sheep to increase his income.

In this group picture, Arishetu is the third person from the right as you face the group picture. She is married with nine children and lives in Nyong-Gumah, a village in northern part of Ghana. The solidarity group Arishetu belongs to had a dream of increasing production and later running a supermarket for the shea butter. Because of a lack of adequate funds the outlook was bleak but now it is rekindled by the coming of Kiva loans to their community. She is requesting a loan of GHS 5,400 to buy and process five bags of shea nuts into shea butter for the export market. Arishetu can then be able to make more profit, repay her loan and also help feed her

He learned this work from his father and older brothers. He gets up at 5am to work and finishes work at 12 noon. He does this Monday through Saturday. In the afternoons, he works a small home garden that they have. \r\n\r\nBecause winter is erratic, this year there will be losses with the established crops. So Jose is anticipating what could happen and wants to have other alternatives. That is why he will be begin to grow beans, to make up for the loss of corn crops, which have already suffered because of the drought. \r\n\r\nFor that he is requesting the loan to buy bean seeds, pesticide, weedkiller, and labor. His main dream is to be able to have a house worthy of his family.

rains.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1665321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

She sells her farming produce for cash at the end of the winter season, so that she can repay her loan and have enough income to provide for her own needs as well as her childrens'; part of the income is used to help her husband ensure the family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1647983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy small materials, seeds and agricultural inputs, as well as to pay for labor for the hoeing of the fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Siradjankoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-12T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-11T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":65.18,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alimata           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  Sidi      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia   Drissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa  Boukary   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba  Labi  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":959.82,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":502866.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":65.18,"payment_id":610752526}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T15:11:45Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T13:06:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":738540,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty is 23 years old and lives in the town of Seeta in the Mukono region of Uganda.

The loan will be used to purchase more fresh food and more sacks of charcoal for sale, and will help Betty to generate greater profits and save money and build a house. Betty hopes that in the future, she will be able to build a commercial house. \n\nBetty is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.
