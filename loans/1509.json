With the received credit, she will purchase a cow and will start producing dairy products to use for her family as food, as well as to sell locally. Tata will be able to generate income and will provide better living conditions for her

Meet Siphira, a very hardworking, humble and ever-smiling mother of 3 lovely children. She hails from the Chuka area of Kenya, an area that is located on the slopes of Mount Kenya (one of the tallest mountains in Africa). She is married and together with her husband they work as a team supporting each other as spouses, parents and mixed farmers. Chuka area has one of the best weather conditions that favors crop and animal farming and through hard work and dedication she has been practicing farming for the past 8 years and through all those years she has been making great strides in farming and profits margins.\r\n\r\nSiphira's source of income is tea farming, crop farming and a small personal business that she does so as to make ends meet. Her love for dairy farming can be shown through the nickname she has given her cow \u201cChia magochi\u201d.\r\n\r\nChuka area has a high population and the demand for cereals is high but there is a low supply.

are 42 years old and have five children and are all living in polygamous families in Tiefagala, one of the villages of Bougouni, third administrative region of Mali. They are working with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to better run their seasonal agricultural businesses. They are on their fourth loan with the microfinance institution, having properly paid back their previous loans. Rice is the crop cultivated by Tenimba, the first woman seated in the photo from left to right.

He is committed to his newly-wedded wife, with whom they have been blessed with a baby boy. \r\n\r\nLike most smallholder rural farmers in Kenya, Gideon is a mixed farmer. From the age of 15, he has been selling his produce, which includes milk, tea, and other crops at the local market. Gideon is also engaged in other side businesses. When asked, he stated that he enjoys dairy farming. However, he admitted to having challenges managing his tea crops in their initial stages. \r\n\r\nGideon is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow.

Meet Janeth, a 38-year-old farmer from Litein, Kenya. A mother of two,  she is very passionate about farming. She started doing dairy farming nine years ago. Since then, she has never looked back - she loves it. Her main sources of income are milk and tea. Milking her own cows is an activity she finds to be most enjoyable. She is appreciative of the fact that milk prices in the region sustain dairy farmers. This enables her to enjoy profits from selling milk which is part of the reason she is seeking a loan to purchase another dairy cow. An additional cow will certainly boost milk production in her farm. This will translate to more sales volume and better income for her and her family.  \r\n\r\nJaneth believes the key to increased milk production is proper health of the animal. A dairy cow needs roughage and protein in her diet to be healthy. By ensuring her cows are healthy, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. The additional income she will make will go towards affording her family a better quality of life.

area always referred to as \u201cthe city of champions\u201d, because it is home to the best long distance runners in the world, many having won gold medals in international events). He has a wife and two lovely children that he really treasures and values and will always do anything possible to protect. He practices mixed farming, i.e. crop and animal farming, and he has been doing this for the past six years. He passionately loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed his cow \u201cLelmet\u201d and whenever he is milking his cow he feels very proud.\r\n\r\nEldoret area is the fourth largest town in Kenya and is very populated. Cornelius sells milk and farm produce at the market and has been earning a decent income, but one challenge he has been facing is transporting the products from his rural village to the market. Cornelius comes from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, that are not tarmacked, hence timely delivery of his products to the market is affected. Sometimes he sells his products at a throwaway price because it is not fresh. Cornelius sells milk, vegetables and fruits: perishable products that need timely delivery to the market in order to fetch a high price.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan Cornelius will be able to purchase a motorbike,  which he will use for the timely delivery of his products and this will translate into more profits.  Consequently, he will never suffer losses because of not delivering products on time to the market. With the help and goodwill of  lenders,  he is going to achieve his goal, and profits from the business will be used in fully repaying  the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":669.17,"image":{"id":1667058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is a native of Leon, which is located in the western part of the country.\r\n\r\nThis young woman stands out as a determined person, with a desire for self-improvement. Unfortunately, due to lack of economic resources, she couldn't finish her schooling and needed to work at a young age to help cover expenses.

She wants to start a milk products business, such as butter, paneer (cottage cheese), curds, etc., and for that, she needs more cows for more milk. The joint initiative with Kiva and BJS enables her to get a loan to purchase a milking cow. Once the cow is purchased, Shikha will start producing dairy products to use for her family as well as to sell locally.

She is 43 years old and currently resides with her family in Cavite, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Richie would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 10,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Richie hopes to expand her business and manage a grocery store of her own. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1667003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-08-13T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-12T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3656.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000389},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3656.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491911},{"amount":66.64,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2925.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625100},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":731.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535249}],"funded_date":"2014-08-13T03:41:32Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:25:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":750487,"name":"Maria Dora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda una gran luchadora de la vida que hace 9 a\u00f1os inicio con una venta de tamales la cual fue alternando con venta de variedades como barnice, productos de uso personal, chulos, diademas entre otras cosas ya que era madre cabeza de hogar y velaba por el cuidado de sus 2 hijos.\n\nCon la ayuda de los microcr\u00e9ditos ha logrado mejorar y tener un local comercial y ahora pide la ayuda nuevamente para surtir su negocio comprando variedad de mercanc\u00eda como flotadores, ropa para hombre y dama, zapatos, gorras, billeteras etc. \n\nCon el pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 mejorar su negocio y ante todo das las gracias a todas las personas que quieren confiar en ella pues es una prueba viviente que con \u00e1nimos y mucho trabajo se puede lograr grandes cosas, no quiere trazarse una meta pues cuando la alcance no tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s ilusi\u00f3n prefiere mejorar cada d\u00eda y esforzarse por sus hijos, por su familia, por ella misma. \n","en":"Maria is a great fighter in life who 9 years ago began selling tamales.

Meet Lily, a 33 year-old farmer from Litein in Kenya. She resides with her 34 year-old husband with whom they are blessed with 2 boys and 1 daughter. Lily has been actively involved in farming for the last 10 years. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs and various varieties of food crops at a local town. She enjoys dairy farming - Milking her cows is her hobby. The biggest challenge she faces is a lack of exotic breeds in the market. These breeds have very desirable traits that make them more productive and valuable to dairy farmers. To solve this problem, Lily is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase an additional dairy cow. Having an additional cow will provide her with a lot of practical benefits. She believes the pasture she gives to her cows provides great-tasting dairy products that are more nutritious and flavourful than those processed and sold at shops. She will also be able to produce more milk and increase her sales volume.  In the short run, she will be saving the returns to buy a motorcycle that will aid transportation of farm produce to further markets. In the long run, she will have saved enough money to go for better breeds of cows. Lily\u2019s dream is to build her capital and asset base in order to lead a financially secured life in future.

His primary income sources are milk, tea and other varieties of crops. Samwel is also engaged in other small personal businesses. He has stated that he enjoys dairy farming very much. His biggest challenge, however, is disease outbreaks in the region. Samwel is seeking a loan to purchase an additional dairy cow after assessing the persistent demand for milk in Kisisara. With this loan, he is going for productive animals with average production of 15 litres of milk per day. Having understood the market requirements, he wants to expand his dairy farm in a modern manner with more animals so that he can diversify the farm\u2019s products. Your loan will help Samwel make enough money to settle his high family expenses.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase an Ultra filtration water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nDynamic Secondary Jezza, will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank.

She is a smallholder mixed farmer based in Mukure village in Kerugoya, Kenya. She is married to a lovely husband with whom she has been blessed with two daughters. For the last six years, Eunice has been selling milk, eggs, tea and other crops produced at her farm in the local market.\r\n\r\nLately, Eunice noticed a growing demand for pig products. She has done her homework and realized that she stands to greatly boost her income if only she could venture into pig farming soon. A sow delivers twice a year with up to 16 piglets at a single go. A piglet in Kenya goes for KES 3,000 ($34). The pig business could very well be Eunice's way out of poverty. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan of KES 10,000 to purchase a male and a female pig. She wants to start small and grow her expertise in pig farming over time with the gradual growth of the business. Her goals are very realistic and achievable.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Eunice will tap into this very unmissable opportunity. The money made from the initial investment in pig farming will enable her to afford other farm-related expenses. Her family at large will benefit from the extra income they stand to make.

Now, at the age of 22, this businessman has been able to increase his line of products from what he offered 4 years ago.  As he says with a smile, he feels grateful to MiCr\u00e9dito, Kiva, and everyone who lent him a hand when he needed a loan.  He used his first loan to buy t-shirts, clothespins, pearl beads, colored stones, and silver-plated metal, among other products that helped him to increase his income.  His wife and son, for whom he is responsible, are his source of inspiration to keep growing.\n\nFor this reason, with the help of his sister and brother, Ricardo has decided to adapt.  And so he needs a loan to buy a motorcycle in order to be able to carry his merchandise to stores or the market without spending as much as he has in the past on buses.  When he pays it off, he is thinking about asking for a new loan because, in spite of feeling self-sufficient, he wants to keep growing with loans until he has his own

She is the eldest daughter in her family.  Her two younger siblings are in high school, her mother is a professor in the Universidad del Norte, and her father is currently unemployed.  Despite the economic hardships that they faced, Julieth was able to obtain a full scholarship that allowed her to study Psychology in the Universidad del Norte.  She earned her professional degree in February of 2014, finishing at the top of her class.  \n\nJulieth's primary goal is to be able to complete her Masters in Educational Psychology in a university abroad.  In order to achieve this, she is seeking support from Kiva because it is the only way she will be able to cover the costs of the language exams and the university application fees.  Once she completes her degree and returns to Colombia, Julieth plans to work in the national bilingual programs, creating projects in the region with high school students seeking to decentralize language education through quality public education throughout all of the vulnerable regions.\n\nHer family has always been the foundation for all of the projects that she has started.  During the entirety of her life, they have given her unconditional support.  In this new dream of hers, it has not been any different, and although they do not have the financial resources to help her, they have supported her in different ways such as helping her to find the best programs in the best universities, which she values immensely.  Education is one of the pillars on which the main characteristics of a society are built.  For this reason, it is a subject that deserves special attention when seeking a solution to the current crises in Colombia. Therefore, it is worth it for professionals to work in educational systems to develop capable leaders to generate positive change through them by taking into account their individual history, qualities, limitations, interests and specific motivators.  \n\nThe opportunity to study in a foreign country where there are different educational models and ideas will allow her to nourish herself with the things that have been effective in different settings, and different ways of facing problems and situations so that later she can develop and implement coherent solutions within the context of Colombia, employing what she have acquired to combine international perspectives with the national reality.\n\nCurrently, she is working part-time in a business that focuses on psychological studies of consumption.  She coordinate an educational psychology project.  At the same time, she is working as a field researcher for a research study in the Universidad del Norte.

For the past three years, Teddy has been working hard to manage her produce business, which sells produce. <br \/><br \/>To help expand her business, Teddy has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more produce like beans, rice and maize flour to sell, and will help Teddy to generate greater profits and help her go for higher studies. Teddy hopes that in the future she will be able to become a better businesswoman. <br \/><br \/>Teddy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

He is a kind and hardworking person.  A carpenter by profession, he keeps on working day and night to make sure that all of his family\u2019s needs are met. Carpentering is his personal business and a source of regular income in the family. He is involved in manufacturing wooden shoe molds in order to supply the shoe manufacturing firms. His wife stays at home, but due to illness is unable to contribute much. This business yields a good income for him, but his family's needs have increased day by day and he needs to earn more money. Now he wants to buy more raw materials for making wooden shoe molds. This is why M. Shafeeq came to BRAC Pakistan and wishes to obtain a loan, so he can buy raw materials for making wooden shoe molds. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will prove beneficial and productive for his business, as well as for his family.

She is 48 years old and a mother of 6. She is a dedicated housewife always making sure that all her family's needs are met. One of her sons runs a general store in the local community. In order to provide more products to his customers, her son needs funds. Currently his income is not sufficient to cover the expenses for purchasing new stock.

He opened a small shop where he offers cleaning products like mops, brooms, carpet beaters, dustpans, and vegetables and staple goods. He began with a small storefront and grew little by little. Now he is in a bigger storefront and the advantage is that it is the only storefront of its kind in the area; without his store, the neighbors would have to go very far to get any product not produced on their own farms, or for any medicine. Therefore, he opted for this storefront so he can help his neighbors. He wants to request a loan to renovate the store, buy display cases, paint, organize the store a bit, and buy a variety of staple goods products, cleaning supplies, fruits and vegetables. With the loan he will be able to provide better service and build a flagship store in the area where his neighbors can buy products without going long distances, which can sometimes be more than an hour."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1666418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural

He is a responsible father of three sons and three daughters. He is religious, sympathetic, honest and a hard worker. He is running a small business in a nearby town to provide services in the form of running a grinding stone. He wants to help the people, which is the reason he decided to open a grinding stone shop in the society.  He speaks in a monotonous tone, which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone; he has built very good relations with his customers. His grinding stone shop is very famous in the town and that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relations, his sales have increased a lot. He sells flour in the shop as well, so he needs wheat to get more stock of flour in shop.\r\n \r\nGhulam Mustafa is the sole earner of the family and has been providing financial support to the whole family by himself. His expenses increase day by day because his children have grown. Therefore, Ghulam Mustafa requested a loan so that he would be able to buy more stock of wheat and grind it with his grinding stone (machine).

He buys calves, cows and goats and sells meat from his shop to the customers. His number of clients has increased due to his good attitude towards his clients. Moreover, he is the sole earner of his family so he wants to increase his income. In this way, he will be able to meet his family's requirements. He is a very honest shopkeeper. He behaves politely to people. He wants to offer chicken to his customers. Therefore he wants to buy broilers, calves and goats to sell meat at his  butcher shop to improve his standard of living. For the development of his business, he needs a loan. So he contacted BRAC Pakistan who issued him a loan for his butcher shop.

He was worried for many days about how to avoid a daily fare, so he decided to buy his own rickshaw. \r\n\r\nParveen has been saving to buy new auto rickshaw, but at the time of purchasing some money remains short. Therefore, she has requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy new rickshaw with the contribution of savings.  She hopes that soon he will not need to pay a daily fare which will cause an increase in income. \r\n\r\nShe is very happy after receiving this loan and thanks Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan.

He is the father of a daughter and living nearby his cloth shop. This cloth shop is the only source of income for his family and this is the reason he devotes  all his time and energy to the shop. \r\n\r\nHis shop is situated in the clothing market and there are a lot of competitors in the market. Due to this competition it is very difficult to convince customers to pay a high price. This competition becomes the cause of low sales and more efforts as well. He has to maintain the latest designs, prices and delightful colors of cloth in his shop so that he can maintain the rate of turnover.\r\n\r\nNow the major problem is that the Eid festival is about to come and he does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy cloth according to the taste and demand of customers. If he can not purchase the cloth as per the choice of his customers, then his sales might be highly affected.

Farming is the only source of the family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nKarine currently wants to enlarge the livestock a little bit to be able to meet her family's increasing daily needs. A loan of $2,000 (USD) will be a great support to this hard-working woman and will enable her to purchase a cow and forage for the livestock. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately hasn't been able to repay it. However, thanks to her hard work, Karine was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo, Karine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Karine will be very thankful to all the lenders for helping them develop their

The loan will be used to buy sacks of sweet potatoes and bananas and will help Resty generate greater profits and stock more food. Resty hopes that in the future she will be able to expand into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nResty is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.
