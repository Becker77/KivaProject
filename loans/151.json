The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives on Tacna Avenue in Mazocrux, Peru. Modesta is a new member of the Generation 2000 Community Bank. She decided to join because she lacked capital and for the ability to receive a loan. With the loan she is requesting, which she plans to repay within four months, she will purchase one sack of rice, one sack of sugar, one sack of noodles, one package of soft drinks, among other items. Modesta tells us that she does not know her parents, who left her when she was three years. Her mother left her with a childless single mother. There she grew up, dedicating herself to kitchen chores, washing, grazing cattle, etc., until she and her partner started a business buying and selling alpaca meat in Mazocruz at retail. Three years ago she set up a convenience store and from 2006 she also has prepared meals on market days (Fridays and Saturday). Her dream is to purchase a truck so she can transport vegetables and grocery products to the different outdoor markets, and in this way she'll be able to obtain more income for her children's education so they can grow up to be successful.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":208860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase rice, sugar, noodles, soft drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mazocruz, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.75 -69.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-08T01:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T02:50:17Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":130.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331006},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":130.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951376},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":130.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224403},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":130.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417126}],"funded_date":"2008-10-08T02:50:17Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":71591,"name":"Rahmonjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rahmonjon O. is married and has eight children.

E. is living with her entire family in a house of 3 sleeping rooms and one sitting room. E. has faced so many challenges in life such as the death of her parents, school dropout and family problems. These problems made life unpleasant to E. until the year 2006 in which she came to the knowledge of GHAPE and became a member. E. obtained her first loan from GHAPE in the year 2006, which was 20,000 FRS, and received 150,000 FRS in the year 2008; the repayments were made promptly.<p>\r\n\r\nWith a loan of 250,000 FRS, E. plans to buy more yams for 100,000 FRS, plantain and cocoyam for 100,000 FRS, and fruits and vegetables like pineapples, carrots, and bananas for 50,000 FRS. <p>\r\n\r\nE. greatly believes the business will progress because of the experience she has had in the business and the high demand for her goods. With this business, E. helps her community by supplying food to them, reducing their need to travel to the market and even increasing the economic status of her community. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children's school fees and to feed and clothe her children. Her repayments will commence in the fourth month from the day of disbursement.<p>\r\n\r\nShe prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE offers before disbursing loans, the proper follow up that is done when the loan is repaid, and the comfortable method of repayments. <p>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

(second from right) is a thirty-year-old businesswoman who lives about an hour outside of the capital, Santo Domingo, in a city called Los Alcarrizos. She is a coordinator for the Bank of Hope \u201cEncuentro con Jesus\u201d (Encounter with Jesus). While this is the third loan that Luz has taken out with Esperanza International, it is the first loan for many of the other women in her group.\r\n\r\nLuz took out her first group loan in February 2008 and has consistently and persistently made her payments. However, the previous members of her group struggled to accept the responsibilities associated with microfinance and thus the group suffered from solidarity and cooperation problems. Esperanza International utilizes group lending, which means that the other members of the group are held responsible if one member defaults. Luz is excited because she has great hope for the responsibility and solidarity of this new group. She shared that it is directly evident that these women are ready to flourish with the opportunity that microfinance provides and are simultaneously ready to be dependable group members.\r\n\r\nIn February 2008, Luz ran a colmado, a small store that sells primarily durable goods and foods such as rice and potatoes. Almost a year and a half later, Luz now runs a cafeteria where she sells a variety of lunch foods including fresh juices, fried chicken, empanadas (a pastry turnover filled with savory ingredients and baked or fried), and tostados (a tortilla fried in deep fat with various fillings piled on it). Currently, Luz is unable to satisfy the demands of her customers (certainly a good problem to have); thus, she will use her loan to purchase more primary materials so she can expand the amount of food she produces with her mother.\r\n\r\nLuz hopes to use her increased profits to not only expand her business but also to save up to replace her tin roof with a more stable cement block roof since it rains frequently in Los Alcarrizos. This new roof will truly be a manifestation of the stability and improvement that microfinance can foster.\r\n\r\nLuz lives with her husband, who sells construction materials, and her two children (4 and 6). She is excited for her children\u2019s future and wants them to grow up studying hard, attending church, and making good friends. The children are not the only ones studying in this family. In fact, Luz has been taking night classes in the capital. While she is currently between sessions, she plans to resume classes in August. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Luz N., the Bank of Hope Encuento con Dios, and the microfinance institute Esperanza International, thank you for providing opportunities to those who need it most!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":349316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He lives with his wife and child. Both he and his wife work to support the family. He has owned his own mini-market since 1997. These small stores are common throughout Lebanon and can be found in almost every neighborhood. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of $1000 from the Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to increase his store\u2019s inventory. This will be his first loan from Ameen. He estimates that the loan will help him increase his profit by 15%.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.).

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

This district is part of Lambayeque Province, which is located an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past year, Santos has been providing cargo and passenger transport services using a motorcycle taxi (a vehicle that consists of a motorcycle taxi with an attached cabin for providing transportation services).

The income he receives from this business is used to support his family.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to continued use and the poor condition of the local roads, his vehicle has developed some problems that require urgent repairs to ensure that it operates properly.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Mohammadu can store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>Mohammadu is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"issue","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2045927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdullahi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10336.38,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10336.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Valerie Taylor","image":1901691}},{"id":1951,"name":"Francisco Javier","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr Francisco is the owner of a printing business, and his experience is in the area of 30 years \\\\\\\"A lifetime,\\\\\\\"says Mr Rodriquez.<p>He principally prints  advertisement copies, business cards, calendars and at this time of year, Christmas cards.

They supply themselves from the market gardeners in Werekela and the surrounding area, and sell their goods at the market in Fana at retail and in cash to a clientele composed of women.\r\nThey hope to realize a profit of 10,000 FCFA each at the end of the loan cycle, which will be used to take care of and pay for the education of their children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":279322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bako ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kourou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ne  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba  B  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50978.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033683},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621051},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020016},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242761},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25489.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678315}],"funded_date":"2009-04-03T12:05:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":96183,"name":"Nuevo Milenio Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \"Nuevo Milenio\" esta representado por el se\u00f1or Walter Santos y conformado por 12 miembros D. los cuales su principal actividad es el comercio D. productos como accesorios D. celular, material D. escritorio, cosm\u00e9ticos, abarrotes, dulces y al servicio p\u00fablico D. pasajeros.

She is married, 58 years old, and has five married children.  Gloria used to be a street vendor, selling stockings from a cart in the market, but she had to stop working for a time when she suffered a slipped disk.  Later, she decided to work at home, setting up a small grocery called Bodega Gloria which she has operated for two years.  Gloria needs a 1000-soles loan to buy cold drinks, beer, milk and bags of sugar.  Since starting at Finca, she's learned how to invest and she now invests all her borrowings in merchandise for the business.  She likes the camaraderie of the group and the sense of solidarity that the community bank provides.  Gloria's greatest hope is to be happy both at home and at her bodeguita.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":309270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T19:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44443473},{"amount":54.05,"local_amount":166.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T01:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":167.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953790},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":168.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63171014},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167.01,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596382},{"amount":54.06,"local_amount":166.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":167.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87031869},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96944315}],"funded_date":"2009-04-24T19:52:58Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T20:15:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":108471,"name":"Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"L.

Con el pr\u00e9stamo que solicita, lo invertir\u00e1 para construir un kiosko y comprar m\u00e1s productos para abastecer su puesto de ventas. ","en":" Carmen is 52 years old, is married and has two children and four grandchildren. All of them live with Carmen in the home she owns. To earn a living, she sells sweets such as cookies, chocolates and candies as well as cigarrettes in a small space that she created outside the house with a table to display her merchandise. She has been selling her goods from home in the afternoon for the last 10 years. In the mornings, she is a street vendor and sells fava beans, peanuts and other products. Her work keeps her active and she enjoys the activity and serving her customers. Carmen's business is profitable since there is a lot of foot traffic in her area which allows her to sell every day. This is her third loan with MFP and she is committed to paying the loan back on time. She tells us she enjoys working with her Village Bank as all of the members are very supportive and honest in their work. She will use the loan to build a kiosk and to buy more merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":461003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To construct a kiosk and to purchase more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-30T17:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":304.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":309.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":330.32},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":338.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":352.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":364.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.61},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.65,"local_amount":304.7,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":307.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124423},{"amount":108.35,"local_amount":309.58,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":312.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960164},{"amount":115.61,"local_amount":330.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":332.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993008},{"amount":118.42,"local_amount":338.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":341.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717794},{"amount":123.32,"local_amount":352.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":355.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751469},{"amount":127.65,"local_amount":364.72,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":367.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933926}],"funded_date":"2009-12-30T20:34:05Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":170213,"name":"Sokhom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of three people who are led by Mrs. Sokhom S..

business. She lives in Sitio. Tagasa, Brgy. Bitoon, Daanbantayan, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $210. Jessica is now borrowing 15,000 PHP to use as additional working capital. This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJessica  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

","en":"Robinson has been in business for 15 years.  He started off selling women's, men's and children's clothes whilst also working as a construction worker and selling vegetables in Barranquilla public market.\r\n\r\nWhen he married at 21 and had 3 children, 2 boys and a girl, he took on responsibility for his children with experience and he still assumes responsibility  for his children, who are now aged 15, 27 and 28, and his grandchildren.\r\n\r\nRobinson is a dynamic person who takes part in all the activities Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo offers.  He is a member of the football team which the firm organized and has had 2 loans.  With this latest Kiva loan, he plans to buy toys because the end-of-year period is approaching which is when parents buy toys and let their children know that it is \u201cthe Christ child\u201d who brings the toys on the evening of 24th December.  The little ones think that \u201cthe Christ child\u201d brought them from heaven.  On 25th December you can find happy children playing in the streets of Barranquilla with the toys that Robinson sold to their parents such as scooters, dolls, toy cars and whatever toys are popular that year.\r\n\r\nAs Robinson is always aware of what sells each season, he also sells clothes, footwear, costume jewelry, etc. His business does well because he is aware of sales opportunities.  Robinson's business has the following economic indicators: his accounts receivable turnover is 14 days, his current debt is 1% and his capacity to fulfil payment obligations is 99%, 94% with this new loan.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of his first loan, Robinson felt that his business got moving with new capital.  He was able to save a little and increase his profits slightly.  He hopes that some day he will be able to have a store and he dreams of having a vehicle to transport his goods as this would make his life easier."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":652024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Evelyn B., 38, does just that. Evelyn is only a high school graduate, but right now she manages her own micro-business. She is married to a construction worker, Joevil, and mother to her three children, who are all studying at a public high school nearby.  Together, they live in Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nEvelyn runs her own sari-sari (variety) store, located in an extension of their house. Every day, she observes the buying patterns of her customers and notes their preferences in terms of the type of item they buy, the price and the brand. She sees to it that her customers get what they desire. She also operates a food stall where she offers food items among her local community. Monthly, Evelyn earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan.  She intends to meet the demands of her customers.  As needed, she will buy more stocks of rice, soft drinks and other grocery items.  She also will use part of this loan to buy more raw ingredients needed for her food stall.\r\n\r\nEvelyn acknowledges that no challenge is too hard to deal with. She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome and uphold the future of both her children and her business. She dreams of making her sari-sari store grow. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay  microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":758740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional grocery items for her variety store and more raw ingredients needed for her food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-26T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4320.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123638},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266.68,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4320.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195045},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5333.35,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5400.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474096},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2133.29,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2159.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636877}],"funded_date":"2011-04-26T16:11:06Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Allison Bruce","image":77230}},{"id":297803,"name":"Ronald Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ronald  tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l es soltero y vive con sus padres no tiene carga familia.

Levon sells derived honey to his regular customers.\r\n \r\nRecently Levon has laid out a garden where he grows nuts and fruits. He says when his trees grow enough he will be able to sell nuts and fruits and to gain additional means for his family. \r\n\r\nLevon is seeking a 1,000,000 AMD loan to buy 10 beehives and to fence his garden. \r\n\r\nThis is Levon's fifth loan from Nor Horizon and he has never delayed his repayments.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":856913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

","en":"Ana, 33 years old, lives in the city of Cartagena with her spouse and their 4 children, ages 3 to 15. Three years ago, Ana decided to undertake a business selling frozen goods and another selling footwear and bags. She learned the first business after having worked with her aunt in that area and decided to undertake it because she is a lover of good food. Initially she worked to order and once she had a dedicated clientele, she expanded to include the other business\u2014selling bags and footwear. She makes a list of interested customers, and buys and distributes the products after talking with the customers by phone. Her goal is to formally establish her micro-business and get a retail location. This would allow her to establish herself and earn even more money. Additionally, in the future it would allow the possibility of her children having a quality education. She also has as a goal improving the location of her business and making improvements to her home; this is her dream of prosperity. Her biggest challenge is making a bigger production line more efficient, because she doesn\u2019t have the machinery required to do so and the space where she works is very small. Even so, she will face this situation with her great creativity. For now she is focusing on increasing the production capacity and organization of her businesses. This is exactly why she is turning to a Kiva loan, her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She started processing dried potatoes and wheat in small quantities to sell in the market, but when she became ill she was prohibited from spending much time in water, so she could no longer process grains. She thought then she could buy grains in bulk and sell them wholesale. Because she needed capital for this, she accepted an invitation from a neighbor to join the Communal Bank called \"The Olive\". With her first loan of approximately $96, she purchased a large quantity of wheat and potatoes, and sold it wholesale. In this way she worked for about two years, saving her resources to start a warehouse, which she did successfully. At present, she does various activities: she and her children take turns working in the warehouse, she buys and sells grains wholesale, and and on Wednesdays and Sundays she sells cheeses in the plaza to pilgrims visiting the Virgen a la Puerta.\r\n\r\n<p>The loan that was recently approved by Manuela Ramos for approximately $636 will be used to buy grains such as wheat and corn, as well as dried vegetables, in bulk. Mrs. Verail hopes to buy a car and two motorcycle taxis to rent out, and in that way she can generate more income.\r\n\r\n<p>(Translated from the Spanish by Naomi Johnson, Kiva volunteer)\r\n\r\n<p>La se\u00f1ora Verail naci\u00f3 en Muchamaca un caser\u00edo de la provincia de Otuzco pero desde muy peque\u00f1a vive en el distrito de Otuzco, Provincia de Otuzco del Departamento de La Libertad; tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad y dos hijas menores que dependen de ella.

She has been a very hard-working woman during her whole life just to sustain her family .She was forced by her parents to get married early because they were unable to pay her school fees and so she dropped out of school. This has made Unice very worried when she sees her friends doing well.  In the cause of hard work, she encountered some challenges in life such as the death of her father and poor health. These challenges made life miserable for her until the year 2007 when she discovered GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member.<P>\r\n\r\nIn that same year of 2007, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000 FRS CFA and the repayment was made promptly. She is now asking for a loan of 100,080 FRS which she will use to buy red palm oil. She is convinced the business will progress because of the experience she has in the business and because she is considered trustworthy by the members in her community. Operating this business in her community will shorten the distance her neighbors have to go to purchase palm oil which is a big expense for them. Unice plans to use the profit from her loan to pay her children's school fees, feed them, and to take care of their medical expenses if they are sick and taken to the hospital. She prefers to received a loan from GHAPE because of the trust she has in GHAPE; the method of repayment is comfortable and convenient.<P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

western Mongolia. He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian housing tent. His oldest five children, all daughters, attend a local secondary school and his youngest son will soon start kindergarten. M. operates a coal and firewood trading business in his town. \r\n\r\nIn Mongolia, coal and firewood are two common fuel sources used to heat homes and gers. His business is especially profitable during the frigid Mongolian winter months. M. also grows vegetables in the spring and summer months and plans to begin selling them after next years harvest to supplement his income. He is a very hardworking businessman and says, \"I am working hard to better my family and give my children every opportunity to live happy lives.\" He is requesting a 250,000 tugrug (~175 USD) loan to purchase coal for his business. \r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

When she started out 8 years ago she worked as a street vendor selling only clothing in the neighborhoods of Managua.  Hellen has a beauty salon in the same market.  Previously she worked as a domestic, but she gathered together some money and with the opportunity that she encountered with these loans she managed to get herself a stall in the market where she currently works.  Juana, along with the other members, has a stall in the market, which was previously a restaurant that used to also sell liquor, but since it seemed more like a bar than a restaurant she decided to suspend the sale of those products and now sells only food.\r\n\r\nThese women will use the loan to buy products and supplies for their respective businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":586391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy products and supplies for their respective businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liseth Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen Haidee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2433.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2433.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2433.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2433.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2433.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2433.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":234.14,"local_amount":4883.5,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5030.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172038143},{"amount":233.85,"local_amount":4877.54,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T11:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5024.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177328987},{"amount":115.34,"local_amount":2405.61,"processed_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2478.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182464076},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":2433.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182464077}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T18:59:27Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:37:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":228154,"name":"Luz Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She is married to Reynaldo J., an Overseas Filipino Worker, and mother of two young adults who are currently working and helping out with the family\u2019s finances. At this time, she is working hard to continue provision of their family\u2019s everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nPerla maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php25,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nPerla dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

They are all devoted to Jesus, thus the group name.  They are a group of merchants who daily struggle to obtain profits from their businesses.  There are 8 members that have been participating in the program since 2007.  Arsenia is the group\u2019s Secretary.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has 6 children, two of whom are still dependent on them.  Arsenia has managed to overcome adversity.  She tells us:  when her husband stopped working for a mining firm due to staff reductions, she and her minor children started making and selling tamales because her tasty way of making them made it advisable.  She started out as a street vendor and now she sells based on prior orders in various villages near her home; she goes as far as Chosica.

She lives in a house belonging to her family, in the company of her husband and their son. Every day of the week Ana provides public transport with the help of her motorcycle rickshaw. In the beginning it was her husband's business but he got a job offer and for the sake of keeping this source of income she took it up.  It has been one year since she started in the business, and she has learned the skills and abilities to drive such a vehicle. She is very happy to have started in the business especially because it is so profitable. She is able to contribute with her husband towards the household expenses.

On the weekends, she travels to various fairs held in different towns in the Apurimac River Valley where she is able to sell her goods at better prices.  Martha has been working in this business for ten years and has the support of her husband who helps with making sales.  What she enjoys most about her work is advising her customers about which clothes are fashionable in the city of Lima and earning their trust.  She considers the most difficult part to be transporting the heavy bundles of clothing to different fairs.  However, she refuses to give up since the welfare of her family depends on her business.  Eventually she hopes to open another shop in the city of Pichari, an area that is still developing and has a large population.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.

A. is 30 years old, single, and lives with two dependants, a boy and a girl, who are members of his extended family. One of the dependant\u2019s parents died due to HIVAIDS and the other was abandoned during the 1992 land clashes in the Transmara region of Kenya. He lives with them within Kayole, Kenya.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Mark ventured into the business sector by doing tailoring and dressmaking, which he did for 3 years. The business capital was provided by Kenya Agency of Development and Entrepreneurial Technology (KADET), a World Vision micro-finance wing. A loan of Ksh 56,000.00 (USD 800) enabled him to buy sewing machines and clothing materials and he was later able to settle the loan. A golden opportunity from the World Vision emerged and got him a tender to make school uniforms for four schools within Kayole. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, as a form of business expansion, Mark started a mobile phone repair shop and sale of mobile phone accessories. He employed 3 orphans who had gone through technical skills training sponsored by World Vision. Besides offering mobile phone charging services, the number of clients seeking phone repairs has greatly increased. He is currently not able to serve his customers effectively since he lacks computers and power flashers that enable detection of a problem in the phone software hence he incurs extra costs in having to seek that kind of service in the city centre, 20 kilometers from his business location. \r\n\r\nMark is requesting for a loan of (USD 650) to enable him purchase a computer and power flashers. This will enable him to detect the problem in the phone software and to do repairs. This will help improve the profit margins by cutting down on costs of transportation and consultation services from other dealers and also bring flashing services closer to other technicians operating within Kayole. The business will also create employment for the people of Kayole. The loan is repayable within 12 \u2013 18 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":36057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of power flashers and a computer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kayole, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T20:43:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-29T06:07:38Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-08-03T09:22:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":38584},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T09:22:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50079},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-10-03T09:25:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":62498},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-11-03T10:27:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":75883},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-12-03T10:28:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":90724},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:21:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107398},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127278},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147989},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172378},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199701},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226695},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-03T09:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255961}],"funded_date":"2007-05-15T06:07:38Z","paid_date":"2008-07-03T09:05:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14271,"name":"Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hassan C. is married with only one child, but he also takes care of his sisters and brothers and pays for their school expenses.

After getting married, the family's expenses started to accumulate and he started his own business selling foodstuffs. That was two years ago. Little by little he started stocking more products and, based on his customers requests, added items such as soft drinks and sweets. Abdulaziz is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni to remodel and expand his grocery, allowing him to offer better service to his customers. Abdulaziz and his family thank you for your support.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gemma has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gemma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Gemma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":612117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Poblacion, Mahinog, Camiguin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2010-10-04T13:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gemma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1090.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177419571},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1090.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182558650},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1363.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188694886},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1090.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191433623},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":818.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195852750}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T16:45:39Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:48:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Prangley","image":null}},{"id":240468,"name":"Otgontuya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Otgontuya P. is a 31-year-old single mother who lives with her mother and two children in Uvs province in Mongolia.

Growing up in Jailoo, he kept the long-cherished family tradition of raising livestock including horses, sheep and cows. But Ulugbek also had ambitions to move to the city and start his own business. It\u2019s been two years since he started driving a city cab in order to make a living. He also understood that selling cattle raised in the perfect conditions of Jailoo would provide a good source of income. Now Ulugbek spends his monthly income from cab driving on purchasing food for livestock that is taken care of by his parents. Ulugbek hopes to obtain a loan for buying additional livestock for resale. He believes his monthly profit will allow him to successfully repay the loan. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land.
