She has no children. For the past seven months, Resty has been working hard to manage her food stall, which sells fresh fruits. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Resty has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy sacks of sweet potatoes and bananas and will help Resty generate greater profits and stock more food. Resty hopes that in the future she will be able to expand into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nResty is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1667839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

John\u2019s strategy is to focus more on the dairy side of his activities. However, he lacks the finances necessary to make improved adjustments for a better state of his dairy farm\r\nWith your funding, John will construct a cow shed that will create a better environment for dairy management and animal health. A cowshed is also necessary for the introduction of zero-grazing. The chaff cutter, on the other hand, will cleanly and evenly chop hay into small pieces for feeding to livestock. Because of hay\u2019s small size as a result, it will mix well with other feeds to balance a ration. This way, livestock are encouraged to eat more, with less chance of selecting particular parts of their ration, and so there can be less wastage.\r\nExtra income realized from these improvements will

Stanley is 74 years of age and one of the most hardworking men in his village of Kiamuthambi, Kerugoya area in Kenya. He has a wife and 7 children and wanted to lay a good foundation for his family and grandchildren to come. That is why he started farming and has been practicing mixed farming for the past 43 years. His primary source of income has been eggs, crops and some personal business that he does so as to accumulate more wealth. Stanley is so passionate about dairy farming and, as he always says, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart\u201d. He has nicknamed his dairy cow \u201cKibarak\u201d.\r\nDairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed. This has translated to increased earnings for farmers. Stanley, being a very hardworking and visionary farmer, will want to take advantage of the ready market; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi kilimo to buy a good quality breed of a dairy cow. Stanley has already decided what type of dairy breed he requires and, because of the immense knowledge he has on preparing hay, his cows will never lack animal food and this means that there will be increased milk production.\r\nStanley projects that, through the loan, his cow will be giving out more than 10 liters a day and marketing the milk will never be a challenge because he will be selling it directly to the market as well as to big dairy-processing firms, which will result in increased earnings. Profits from selling milk will enable Stanley hit the jackpot. Stanley does not worry too much about competition because there is a ready market for milk.\r\nThrough the loan, Stanley has planned that instead of selling the milk in its raw form, he will be packaging the milk and this will improve his income greatly. He also plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to construct a bio gas digester that he will use in cooking and other domestic chores.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1667940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

For the past two years, Scovia has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which deals in phone repair. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Scovia has requested a loan of 800,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy new phones and housings, and will help Scovia to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her younger siblings. Scovia hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business and become a good supplier. \r\n\r\nScovia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Mathew is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 35 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Mathew is hopeful about what the future holds; he  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, he will finally be able to afford to educate his children. Mathew\u2019s dreams do not end there: \u201cultimately, I want to make more money for myself and my family\u201d, he expressed.

For the past two years, Annet has been working hard to manage her restaurant, which sells cooked food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Annet has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food and utensils, and will help Annet to generate greater profits and provide basic needs. Annet hopes that in the future, she will be able to become a tailor. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Thanks to Mahidahan\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes one cow and five sheep. On her land plot she grows clover and corn. She also cooks food at home for selling to local organizations. Her monthly income is about 6,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Mahidahan has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy sheep for fattening and resale.

He has been a hard working person for over 25 years, who offers his services to those who asks for them, and when he is not contracted, he works in farming where he also brings the basic grains to his household.

The loan will be used to purchase more essential goods for sale, and will help Oliva to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her brother. Oliva hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another business. \r\n\r\nOliva is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Aside from this she also sells direct selling products to her customer. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nClorin hopes to grow her business and improve her profit from it.

Kennedy is a hardworking, ambitious and young farmer who is only 21 years of age.  He hails from Karaini village, a small village in the Kerugoya area of Kenya.  He comes from a very humble background, and has not managed to attend college, but that has not killed his spirit to succeed.  He has actively been involved in pig farming for the past year.  Although he has made great strides in pig farming, he wants to increase the number of pigs on his farm, and is kindly seeking a loan to buy more pigs.\r\n\r\nPig farming is one of the profitable agricultural ventures in Kenya and Kennedy, having an entrepreneurs mind, wants to take advantage of that and improve his living conditions.  Kennedy loves pig farming because pigs are not demanding to keep, unlike poultry that require special care and attention.  Kennedy believes that with the loan his life will permanently change because he will be selling pork meat to the ready market that is available.  As far as market of pig products is concerned, demand is greater than supply.  Kennedy always says, \u201cTo become a successful pig farmer you need three ingredients and that is getting the right breed, giving the right feed, and proper care.\"  With the loan he believes he will become a successful pig farmer and be able to realize his dream of transforming his life.\r\n\r\nHaving been a pig farming for the past year, Kennedy finds it very enjoyable because he does not spend more money on buying food.  Pigs feed on remains that can be collected from hotels and restaurants and hence save a lot of money.  Kennedy will also sell manure from the pigs and use it on his farm, also saving much more money and improving his living conditions.  Profits from selling pig meat to the local market and to industry that produce sausages and bacon will be used to fully repay the loan.  Kennedy's dream is to be able to save more money and improve his education by going back to college, as well as secure the future for his parents and himself.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1668036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-14T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-13T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.07,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2510.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2993.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3041.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3150.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3208.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3294.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3440.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3475.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3582.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3666.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3771.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3866.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.72,"local_amount":6376.25,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6653.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547635},{"amount":35.36,"local_amount":2977.28,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3106.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680637},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3254.28,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3395.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624922},{"amount":39.3,"local_amount":3309.66,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3453.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595193998},{"amount":77.85,"local_amount":6555.94,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6840.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261912},{"amount":65.11,"local_amount":5483.14,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5721.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600177},{"amount":43.97,"local_amount":3723.85,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3885.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":665458786},{"amount":93.98,"local_amount":8319.6,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8681.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.82,"payment_id":681377039}],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T17:57:16Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mark McDermott","image":1404670}},{"id":751625,"name":"Oliver","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oliver is 21 years old and lives in the town of Namutumba in the Iganga region of Uganda.

He is a loving father of two dependent children who are enrolling in a primary school in the village as well as six married children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, he and his wife manage and operate rice farmland which is located near his house. So far, they have been involved in this career for almost forty years. With great effort and hard work, this couple is able to make USD 7 in one day.\r\n\r\nSarin wants to have household energy at a reduced monthly cost by purchasing a solar energy home system.

The village is suffering to get clean water because of the drought in the dry zone area. Also, many villagers have to cross the stream in order to reach their farms because they cannot afford to build a bridge.\n\nThe new loan will mainly help villagers pay the wages of daily laborers who will help the farmers during the busy planting and harvesting seasons. As many young people are migrating to the cities and neighboring countries, such as Thailand, to be traders, there are not enough people for farming. Farmers usually have to pay day laborers a $3 daily wage and contribute as necessary to room and board. In addition to labor fees, farmers must purchase compost and fertilizer to enrich their crops, such as beans and chickpeas.\n\nPictured above are the committee members from the Hta Pin Chaung Village CBO: U Thaung, U Ko, Daw Myint, Daw Htay, Daw Yin, Daw Yee, Daw Tin, U Myint and U Kyi.

He works as a farmer because he inherited the trade from his father who also works cultivating the fertile fields of Guatemala.  \r\n\r\nHis plan is to obtain this loan so that he can reach greater heights in life.  He started working as a farmer because it generates a good income for his family's future.  He will use the new loan to purchase agricultural supplies to plant potatoes on his land, which is ready to plant and harvest.  With the first loan that he received, he was able to grow potatoes and generate greater earnings for his family.  \r\n\r\nOne of Ramon's dreams is to grow more potatoes because he is not satisfied with the little amount that he has now and he wants to acquire more land to grow his potatoes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1667618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Youth"],"use":"purchase agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-08-14T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-13T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ram\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.68,"local_amount":260.11,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":270.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":529924654},{"amount":0.22,"local_amount":1.63,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542417101},{"amount":68.12,"local_amount":510.88,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":532.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561554876},{"amount":36.55,"local_amount":274.09,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":285.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579463821},{"amount":37.88,"local_amount":284.13,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":295.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070498},{"amount":4.76,"local_amount":35.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":37.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612113481},{"amount":73.77,"local_amount":553.28,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":576.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624776755},{"amount":7.88,"local_amount":59.1,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":61.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134062},{"amount":72.93,"local_amount":546.96,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":569.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489197},{"amount":63.21,"local_amount":474.15,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":493.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664971632}],"funded_date":"2014-08-19T12:00:17Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:11:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":751693,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma is a 33-year-old vigorous lady who has been stitching clothes for many years.

The average Babban Gona farmer yields 30 bags\/hectare; double the national average of 14. However, Alasan is ambitious and is hoping that as a result of this loan, he will be able to access quality inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds that will  result in a yield of at least 35 bags of maize per hectare this season.  Alasan is hopeful about what the future holds; he  hopes that with the increased income as a result of a high yield, he will finally be able to afford to educate his children; Ibrahim,  and  Suleiman.

is an agronomist from Dimitrov village. She lives with her husband and son. To be able to meet the everyday needs of the family, Alvard is engaged in breeding livestock, particularly pigs and chickens and cultivating wheat, tomatoes and grass. Her husband helps her a lot in selling the agricultural products in the market. As life gets more expensive, the family's everyday costs are also increasing. Alvard now needs to renovate the greenhouse, which is damaged, to be able to meet her family's needs more effectively. A loan of USD 1,500 will be a great support to Alvard and her family, helping them to pay for renovation of the greenhouse and purchase cucumber seeds and fertilizer. This will give them more opportunities to develop their agribusiness. This is Alvard's first loan, and it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who have not had access to credit products before, because they have no credit history. The family will be very thankful to the lenders for the goodwill and

Leyli has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately she wasn't able to repay it. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Leyli was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. \r\n\r\nLeyli and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for

As the new owner of Tropical Sno, she says her ice is different, packing flavor with every bite. \r\n\r\n\u201cShaved ice is much different from a snow cone, in that it is made by a small counter-top machine that shaves ice, rather than grinding it like a snow cone machine,\u201d Tameka said. \u201cThe ice is so fine, it could be mistaken for real snow.\u201d\r\n\r\nGrowing up, Tameka always loved snow cones. Now, as an adult, she is gearing up to officially open her stand in the next two weeks. She works full time on an Alabama military base as a civilian employee.

A portion of the loan will also be set aside for marketing and advertising, including signage and flyers.\r\n \r\n\u201cMy main goal is to focus on getting started and being successful for these next

house. She has completed almost half of the fence but it is unfinished yet as she has no money. Pine is a 54-year-old married mother of three who lives in the northern part of the country with her family.

Then, one day, after his father received four trash bags full of used fishing equipment in exchange for helping an elderly woman, Michael and his father started the business that would one day become Price 2 Go, LLC, out of their garage.\r\n\r\nMichael had caught the \u201cfever\u201d that anyone in his business will tell you is the key to making it in the wholesale\/reseller industry. One day, he found himself at a trade show talking to a representative of a large manufacturing company that supplies many of the country\u2019s largest retailers. This chance meeting led to Michael being put on an email list that ensured he would get the best prices on goods that had been overstocked by major retailers. He was on his way.\r\n\r\nThough he is a persistent optimist, Michael is the first to admit that being an entrepreneur is challenging. It was a challenge to form relationships with people along the supply chain, to find merchandise that will sell, and to get that merchandise out the door. Most challenging, by far, was when Michael\u2019s then girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e) had a medical catastrophe that left her largely incapacitated. Michael says she is his motivation to make the business work. \r\n\r\nNeeding an infusion of capital to get his business to the next level, Michael will use his Kiva loan to purchase more inventory that he can turn around quickly for about four times the amount he paid for it.\r\n\r\nNot one to get discouraged when things don\u2019t work out, Michael is a ball of energy, always focused on what comes next. With the help of Kiva lenders, Michael will continue to grow the business and provide for his new

She has been in business for over 20 years and used to run a grocery store.  But when she moved she lost customers and had to close the store.  She wants to open a new one in her home because it is the way to earn most income for the family.  \r\n\r\nShe started her caramel business after working in a place where they make them.  She sells little packages to schools, grocery stores, pharmacies and to other fixed customers.  She also works as a street vendor, selling to regular and prospective customers. She purchases goods in cash from fruit dealers and sells to her customers in cash or on credit, collecting every 15 days.  One of her goals is to continue expanding and to open a new grocery store so she can renovate her house.  The goal for this loan is to buy products such as coconut, sugar, firewood, markers, wrapping paper, cinnamon, firewood and other products for her coconut caramels.

There is a petrol station opposite his house and there he sells his goods from his bicycle from 7am until 5pm.\r\n\r\nGonzalo is applying for this loan in order to buy CDs and cassettes in bulk, and to buy fruits, which his partner sells on buses.\r\n\r\nGonzalo's dream is to have a little shop in his house as the street outside has many passers-by; it can be dangerous. Gonzalo also hopes to keep up his good health in order to see his children grow up, and to give them an education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1668265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs & Tapes","sector":"Retail","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy CDs and cassettes in bulk, and to buy fruits, which his partner sells on buses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-15T07:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-14T07:40:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gonzalo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":23.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":23.59},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":24.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.3,"local_amount":50.3,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501608},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":27.09,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":27.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420411},{"amount":24.19,"local_amount":24.19,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":24.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545143},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":25.12,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":25.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145519},{"amount":94.48,"local_amount":94.48,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":94.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769098},{"amount":78.82,"local_amount":78.82,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":78.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200563}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T11:03:01Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:00:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":750477,"name":"Siyabia","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Siyabia est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de cinq(5) enfants dans le quartier d\u2019Ago\u00e8.

Oscar is married; his wife takes care of the household chores. The couple has six children; four lives at home still, and one is in school.\r\n\r\nOscar has been working in farming since he was twelve years old. His father taught him this trade as, from a young age, he took him to work. By doing this, Oscar learned his father's work; his father told him to pay attention and learn about farming as it would be very helpful to him. And, indeed, through farming work, Oscar has helped his children to move forward in life. Oscar's land is a 20-minute walk from his home. He works at farming from 6am until 11am. Oscar also has a chicken farm at his home. His wife works with the poultry and helps to earn another income for the family.\r\n\r\nThis loan from CrediCampo will be used to buy farming supplies for the summer cornfield: Oscar will buy four bags of manure and venom, and 50 chickens for his wife to look after and to send to the market when they are fattened up. (Oscar and his wife work only with customers who buy by the pound). This loan will be used to buy all these items and feed in one go. The feed will be used to make sure that the chickens are fat enough.\r\n\r\nOscar's dreams are for God to give him life and good health to work and teach his children his trade and give them an education, so that they may look after themselves when they have their own homes.

She is a hard-working woman who, a long time ago, established her small business selling food and pupusas. In addition to selling food, she makes clothing to order in her house.  Rosa wants to put security railings in the windows of her house since, as can be seen in the photograph, these are only glass, which causes insecurity for the family due to the fragility of this material. For this reason, she asks FUSAI for a loan to purchase iron railings and window laminate, and metal sheeting for the roof of her house.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1662889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase iron security railings, and window laminate, and metal sheeting for the roof of her house.

She is originally from Chinandega department, located in the western region of the country. She is an enterprising, responsible woman with great desire to improve herself. She is administrator and owner of a lovely grocery store located in her house, where she offers the population products for everyday consumption for the home and in small quantities such as coffee packets, shampoo packets, oil, bread, milk, eggs, boxes of matches, vegetables, cold drinks, basic grains, ice, soft drinks, frozen products, purified water, toilet paper, sardines, medicines, and firewood, among others. In addition, she has other income from the sale of fresh prepared beans, which generate an additional inroad. Her purchases are made in cash from distributors, markets, and distribution trucks at this location. Her sales are made in cash to regular and occasional customers. This business came up due to the necessity to have a means of work and a source of income since she was alone with her two daughters. She began this business with her own funds and capital, since they are products that everyone uses throughout the whole year. She began with a small stall and since has grown little by little. Karla Ver\u00f3nica has worked with Le\u00f3n 2000 in the past and has shown her responsibility for paying on time and correctly. One of her dreams is to be able to grow her business, and improve her home a bit, making more space for her store. The goal of this new loan is to invest in working capital and stock her business with the purchase of general basic grains, soft drinks, candies, and frozen products, among other items. Upon increasing her inventory, she can purchase the products at better prices, stock everything she can, and have the high-demand products and, in turn, have a greater volume of income and offer better prices and satisfy her customers. Karla Ver\u00f3nica is grateful for the help the Kiva lenders offer to people of limited resources and in poor countries such as Nicaragua to have a means of dignified work. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1668273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products for everyday consumption for her grocery store such as basic grains, frozen foods, soft drinks, among others","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-08-15T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-14T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.94,"local_amount":3353.38,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3380.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542558047},{"amount":63.89,"local_amount":1648.68,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-18T10:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1662,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561690906},{"amount":67.42,"local_amount":1739.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-23T10:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1753.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618846},{"amount":63,"local_amount":1625.93,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1639.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595205426},{"amount":450.75,"local_amount":11632.23,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-22T10:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":11726.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610600719}],"funded_date":"2014-09-14T12:08:55Z","paid_date":"2015-02-22T10:41:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":751774,"name":"Maria Tomasa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 52 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1ero de vida y su hija.
