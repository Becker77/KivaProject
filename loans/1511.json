The member standing second from the left with a raised hand is Gulaphula. \r\n\r\nLike most families in the locality, she and her husband are doing an animal trading business. They purchase goats, cows, buffaloes and hens from the nearby market in bulk, and sell them to the customers on a retail basis in her locality. Her husband helps her in procuring goats, cows, buffaloes and hens from the nearby market. During lean days, her husband does labor in her locality and earns some money. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan she wants to take. To improve her living conditions and earn some extra income, she wants to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. To avail a loan, she makes a group of 12 women of her locality.

She will also buy more crates and bottles and construct a good counter to display her drinks. She will buy comfortable chairs for the convenience of her customers. She is positive that her business will succeed because she will put in place all types of drinks. She has regular customers with a good business site and from this business the community will benefit from a regular supply of drinks which are mostly consumed during ceremonies.<br \/><br \/>With the profit from the loan, she will cater to herself and her children by providing good food to her children and also sponsoring their education.

Pazilet has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 1991. Thanks to Pazilet's hard work, today her business contains 4 cows. She grows potatoes on her 0.65 hectares of owned land, carrots on 0.35 hectares, and wheat for internal business consumption and sale on another 0.35 hectares. She sells milk to local residents daily. Pazilet's ecologically clean and delicious agricultural products are in high demand, yielding a monthly income of about 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Pazilet requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy two dairy cows to increase milk production. The earnings from the loan will help Pazilet improve her financial and living

He will also use part of the loan for transportation to sell the chickens in the market. He says his business will succeed because he lives in a community that is suffering from inadequate poultry farms. Also, he has a good business site. The community will benefit from a regular supply of chicks for ceremonies and at moderate prices. And the waste from the fowls will be used as manure to boast crop yields.\r\n\r\nHe says with the profit from the loan, he will ensure a balanced diet for his family, save money for other investment, and provide adequate medication to his family. He says that a GHAPE loan is preferable because of low interest rates, installment payments, advice on management before loan disbursement, and education on other health

While he was in school, he managed to study up to the sixth grade.  He has been married for eight years, and has a four-year-old son.  His wife makes a living doing house work; she also does the household chores and helps her husband harvest the corn.\r\n\r\nFour years ago he started working in security.  Long after leaving school he said that he wanted to work in order to continue studying, but this was not possible because there was only work on the farm he was leaving.  So he decided to dedicate himself to farming with his father, and he made a living in agriculture for three years.  A little time later, he left his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in various places but none of them worked out until one day they called him to work in security, of which he was afraid but the need to work was much greater so he accepted the challenge and today he has spent four years making a living this way.  Work is three hours away from his house, and he travels by bus.  The schedule is 24 hours on the job, then 24 hours off.  He always works in agriculture on the days he has off.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to help his father buy two sacks of manure in order to fertilize his corn field again and to help pay the young man that assists his father, since his father gives him corn and beans when he collects the harvest.  Thus, Jos\u00e9 has to collaborate with his father.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's dreams are for God to provide him health and long life since he says he is willing to work hard in order to give his son something good.  He wants his son to be able to study and become a professional, since he was not able to do so.

Successfully involved in animal husbandry and farming, Taalaikul achieved very good results - she has 1 cow, 10 sheep and 2 horses. Her monthly income amounts to about 12,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Taalaikul requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock. Taalaikul plans to use the profit from the loan to expand her business. Today, Taalaikul and her family live in an apartment and keep livestock at her father-in-law's barns, and this is why she dreams of savings money to buy her own house with large barns for the livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1669167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

together with her husband. Baktygul has a secondary education and, to provide the primary source of income for her family, has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 2002. Thanks to Baktygul's persistence, drive and hard work, today she has 3 cows, 1 calf and 5 sheep. She also has a 0.80 hectare land plot, where she plants beans and clover. The monthly income from selling ecologically clean vegetables amounts to 12,000-18,000 som (KGS).  Baktygul requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy seeds, saltpeter, fertilizers and fuel for doing field work. Baktygul is a leader of the \"Dostuk Jayelgan\" group that consists of another 3 people. Baktygul intends to get a good harvest, which will certainly lead to increasing the family's capital and allow to increase the headcount of dairy cows and also income from selling milk. She wants to direct the earnings from the loan to paying for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1669243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy

Meet Tabitha, a 63 year old wife and mother of 5 lovely children that she really treasures and values. She hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area with perfect weather conditions to support agriculture and also is referred to as a banana growing region. She has been farming for the past 35 years in her small parcel of land and her primary source of income has been milk, tea and some personal business that she does to make ends meet. Tabitha is a very enterprising and a visionary woman who is seeking kindly for funds to expand into poultry farming on her farm.\r\nPoultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and you don\u2019t have to do it in large scale in order to benefit from the business, you can start small. Having a keen eye has helped Tabitha notice a ready market for poultry and wants to take full advantage of that and Improve her income. Although she wants to make her dream a reality, she lacks the finances. This is because accessing funds as a woman in Africa is very difficult, but Tabitha hopes that through your support she will achieve her dream.\r\nThrough the loan Tabitha will be able to reap more profits because the demand for chicken is always high being such a popular meal for many people. Tabitha will benefit from selling eggs, meat and also feathers from her poultry and all this will assure her of improved living conditions and assure her children of a secured future.\r\nThrough partners such as Juhudi kilimo via Kiva lenders, Tabitha feels relieved knowing that her ultimate goal of transforming her life will be achieved. Profits from selling eggs, meat and feathers to fast-food joints and nearby market will be used in repaying back the loan and securing the future of her children and grandchildren.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1669195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start poultry farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-16T10:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-15T10:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.81,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1882.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2244.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2280.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2362.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2406.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2470.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2580.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2606.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2686.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2749.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2828.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2899.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.5,"local_amount":5185.9,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5321.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547637},{"amount":26.45,"local_amount":2266.81,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2326.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680639},{"amount":24.52,"local_amount":2101.35,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2156.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624923},{"amount":29.31,"local_amount":2512.49,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2578.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194000},{"amount":59.21,"local_amount":5075.37,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5208.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261914},{"amount":62.74,"local_amount":5377.76,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5518.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600179},{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":4304.53,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4417.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.39,"payment_id":681377041},{"amount":20.97,"local_amount":1900.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1950.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.2,"payment_id":696586892},{"amount":13.66,"local_amount":1275.14,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1308.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":711505116}],"funded_date":"2014-08-16T12:47:09Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jonathan Hiebert","image":852394}},{"id":751904,"name":"G.s.

They are all single and are traders.  Between them, they have nine children who are all of adult age. \r\n\r\nThey are hard-working, responsible people who are always looking to improve.  They know each other because they are from the same area.  For this reason, they decided to get together and ask for a loan as a group, gaining financial support and being able to invest in their different business ventures.\r\n \r\nThey come from an area in one of the municipalities of Chinandega, which is located in the western part of the country.  It is famous for its trade, and boasts one of the largest sugar mills in the country.  The members work in different lines of work.  This is their way of life as they seek to support their families.  \r\n\r\nThey weren't able to finish their studies because of financial difficulties.  They were only able to learn the basic things such as to read and write; things which they learnt from their families.  Apart from the poverty, the rural area they live in doesn't offer any educational facilities.  The only ones on offer are quite a way away. \r\n\r\nPaula Vicenta is the coordinator of the group who takes care of making the payments on time.  She is also the owner of a woodwork workshop and in addition, she sells tortillas, milk, curd, cereal, pinol and cornmeal, cocoa, cinnamon and other things.  She does all these things from home and also operates near one of the markets in a local town.\r\n\r\nShe trades in cash and has fixed and occasional customers.  She has been doing these activities for more than six years now.  She started up using her own funds, and began by producing seven pounds of corn.  When she saw that demand was increasing, she started to produce more, reaching up to 50 pounds of corn. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, she starting selling curds and sour milk; all the while making all kinds of furniture such as wardrobes, beds, rocking chairs, cabinets, doors and many other things. \r\n\r\nShe dedicates six days a week to her business; working in the morning on one thing and then in the afternoon on another.  Thanks to the good service she offers, she has been able to keep hold of her customers and establish herself more and more in the market with new ones.   \r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to keep expanding in her business so that she can generate more income in the near future.   For this reason, the group 'Shalom' is asking for a loan to invest in buying raw materials, some such as corn, milk, limestone for making tortillas, and other products for their other lines of work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1668479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials to make tortillas, and to buy wood for furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-08-16T10:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-15T10:20:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Eradios","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.68,"local_amount":3952.93,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4024,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542558048},{"amount":84.83,"local_amount":2167.81,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-18T10:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2206.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561690907},{"amount":80.95,"local_amount":2068.73,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-23T10:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2105.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618847},{"amount":130.04,"local_amount":3323.21,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-22T10:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3382.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610600720},{"amount":74.5,"local_amount":1904.01,"processed_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1938.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624460835},{"amount":82.26,"local_amount":2102.24,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2140.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649612351},{"amount":46.52,"local_amount":1188.97,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1210.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666521498},{"amount":50.98,"local_amount":1302.73,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1326.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681389993},{"amount":195.24,"local_amount":4989.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5079.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711519894}],"funded_date":"2014-09-15T02:45:54Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T16:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":752370,"name":"Ofelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ofelia is 46 years old and married with five children.

She is always looking for ways to get ahead. \r\n\r\nFor a long time she has been working in clothing.  She learnt this trade through experience.

Working in this way, she has managed to generate some income to take care of household expenses. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for is to strengthen her business.  With the money she will buy supplies for her clothes making such as cloth, thread, needles, lace, buttons and other things to stock her workshop.  She will also open up a space where she can put her machines so she can work in more comfort.  This will all help her speed up her production process and get more orders, making her business more profitable. \r\n\r\nShe says that her main challenge is the competition in the market.  However, this only motivates her to keep offering a fantastic service and strive for her business to be officially accredited.

Meerim has secondary education. She has been working with agriculture since 2003. She only had 5,000 som (KGS) as starting capital. Currently Meerim has two dairy cows and two calves at her farm. She sells the milk to the local residents. As organic milk is very tasty, it is in high demand. Meerim also has a plot of land of 1.20 hectares, where she grows potatoes, beans and perennial grasses. She sells the vegetables at the local market and uses the hay for the cattle. The monthly income is around 12,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Meerim turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS) to purchase fertilizers and nitrate. Meerim is one of three members of the group \"Dostuk Zhaiylgan\".

She has been engaged in a fishing business with her husband for more than 20 years now. This is the source of their income. \r\n\r\nSeveral months ago, a typhoon hit the country and ruined their fishing boat.

She is 55 years old, and many years ago her beloved husband died, but from this relationship they had three children who are now adults but still live with her. Some years ago, she learned tailoring in a school in her area.  \r\n\r\nWith the goal of having her own income and taking advantage of her tailoring knowledge, Enma established a small sewing workshop in her house. There, she works making all sorts of clothing and crafts made from craft foam with different models and purposes, which is another activity she learned and today allows her to earn her living.  All of her work is done based on individual orders.  In some seasons, she also makes uniforms for schools of different levels in her area.  She works every day from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm and sometimes later when she has orders to complete.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to purchase fabric, craft foam, and other materials for sewing and crafts. She has been in the communal bank for 8 years and she likes it for the help she gets from the group.  Her dream is to have a larger workshop.

Kenya, an area with good weather and rainfall patterns. The Nyamira area is an area popularly known because it\u2019s a banana growing region and the staple food is \u201cmatoke,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. She is a mother and has been blessed with five school-going children whom she really adores and cherishes. \r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years, she has been involved in farming, and through those years she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she offers free advice to upcoming farmers and also free extension services to her neighbors. Her primary sources of income have been tea, crops and dairy farming.\r\n\r\nNyakerario is seeking a loan to start poultry farming, and she has a strong conviction that through the loan, her life will permanently change. Poultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and there is a ready market because the demand for chicken meat is high. Through the loan, Nyakerario is going to benefit from egg selling, meat selling and also selling of poultry feathers. \r\n\r\nFor women like Nyakerario, having access to financial resources through Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva will increase their productivity and improve their future.\r\n\r\nShe has gone through financial training and she is very disciplined with finances.

She has a small food stall near her house, and there she prepares entrees and also fast food such as empanadas, corviches, humitas (tamales) and others.  She works Thursday to Sunday from 4:00pm to 8:00pm and her husband helps her with her work. She has been in this work for over 7 years, with which they get ahead. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase groceries to prepare her dishes. She is a founding member of the communal bank and she likes it for the help that she has always gotten for the well-being of her family. Her dream is to have a large retail space.

She's the single mother of two children, ages 10 and 6, who attend school.

Their main activity is petty trade, as well as rainfed agriculture.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fatou (who can be seen raising her hand, sitting in the middle row, second person from the right), is the main borrower in this group. She is very invloved in the activities of her banc villageois. She is 40, married, and a mother of four: three boys and one girl.

The loan will be used to buy more timber for the business, and will help her to generate greater profits and to buy food for her family. She hopes that in the future she will be able to start a new business. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

As she says, she dreamed of working in her profession, but she never had such an offer or any chance to work at least as a piano teacher.\r\n\r\nAnyway, she says she feels happy with her small family and their cute farm that she established with her husband many years ago. Lusine has a school-aged son, and her husband works at the local rescue service as a rescue man. Lusine\u2019s main occupation is the care of her house and her farm. On her farm she has 5 cows, 2 heifers and 2 calves. So, from the main product of her farm, milk, she makes magnificently tasty cheese and butter, as well as macun (an Armenian national dairy product) to sell.  All of these items she sells to her numerous regular customers right from her farm.\r\n\r\nNow, Lusine worries about the lack of fodder (feed) for her farm cattle, which she always begins to store beforehand.  She will use this loan for the purchase of fodder for her farm

Meet Francis, a very hardworking, industrious and visionary farmer who is 51 years of age.  He hails from the Kisii area of Kenya, an area referred to as a banana growing region, and the staple food is \"matoke.\"\r\n\r\nHe has a wife are blessed with eight children whom he really loves.  He has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years and through those years he has gained much experience. \r\n\r\nHis primary source of income has been milk, egg and crop farming.  Of all the activities he is involved in, dairy farming is what he enjoys and is close to his heart.  And because of this he has even nicknamed one of his cow \u201dmochama\u201d (from a person\u2019s name).  \r\n\r\nFrancis is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow.  Dairy farming is a very profitable agriculture venture in Kenya and dairy businesses have seen an upsurge in growth and milk prices have gone up. \r\n\r\nFrancis is sure that through the loan, he will make more profits from selling milk.  Francis does not worry about the market because he will be selling milk directly to the market and to big dairy processing firms.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Francis will not only benefit from profits from milk selling but from manure from the dairy cow and hence increase productivity on his farm. \r\n\r\nMoney will be saved because he will not have to buy manure and hence the money will be used to improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nFrancis is very visionary and hopes to increase his business by packaging milk and products such as yogurt. \r\n\r\nThrough increased income he will permanently change his life and assure that his children will receive a good education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1669479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Fanny, a 46 year old woman who is married with three children who are 24, 16 and 14 years old, lives in this place. Her two youngest children are in high school, but all three of them still live at home. Her husband is a driver. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of earning something of her own, allowing her to help her husband and improve the home, Fanny began selling all types of clothing, shoes and food products from her home. She sells door to door and also from her home where she has a small shop from which she sells food and products like her customers want. She works every day, allowing her customers a credit that they pay off every 15 days. She has been working like this for five years and it has been going very well.

Meet Sarah, a 63-year-old, energetic and hardworking mother of two lovely children, who reside in Litein area of Kenya. This area experiences one of the good weather patterns that favour crop and animal farming. Sarah has been a farmer for the past 40 years and through the income, she has been able to take care of her family and parents, making sure that they have the basic needs. Due to the high unemployment rate in Kenya, Sarah could not find a job to support her family, but she didn\u2019t surrender to that. She started farming, and through mixed farming she has been able to earn a decent income. \r\n\r\nSarah is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to buy poultry. Because of an increased market in poultry, Sarah wants to take advantage of that. Having an entrepreneurial mind, she cannot let this opportunity pass by.

For the past one year, Bushira has been working hard to manage her carpentry business, which sells house furniture. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Bushira has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more timber for furniture, and will help Bushira to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young sister. Bushira hopes that in the future she will be able to start up another business. \r\n\r\nBushira is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

a\u00f1o 2001, cuando al mudarse en un barrio del municipio de Soledad, percibi\u00f3 que tenia la oportunidad de vender en su propia casa, art\u00edculos necesarios, que sus vecinos deb\u00edan comprar en el centro de la ciudad cercana y les salia mas costoso en tiempo y dinero, a ninguno se le hab\u00eda ocurrido tener un punto comercial y por esta raz\u00f3n Elizabeth di\u00f3 inicio a  su idea, tomando sus ahorros para invertirlo en su meta inmediata de producir. Hoy vende en una peque\u00f1a miscelanea papaeler\u00eda, accesorios femeninos, bisuter\u00eda, art\u00edculos para el hogar y detalles para regalos., a cr\u00e9dito y de contado, entre su clientela conformada por vecinos del sector donde habita. Su meta mas adelante es abrir 2 locales mas en barrios contiguos en los que aun no hay este tipo de negocio y aumentar cada vez mas la calidad de vida de su familia. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 art\u00edculos de papeler\u00eda, juguetear\u00eda, accesorios para el hogar, con ello mejorar\u00e1 el surtido de su local comercial y atraer\u00e1 mucha mas clientela con la cual mejorar\u00e1 las condiciones de su negocio.","en":"Elizabeth, age 34, has been working as a merchant since 2001.  When she moved to a neighborhood in the Soldedad municipality, she saw that she had the opportunity of selling at her own house.  She sells items that her neighbors need that they had to buy at the center of the nearby city.  This was more costly for them in time and money.  It had not occurred to anyone to have a commercial place in her neighborhood.  That is what gave start to Elizabeth\u2019s idea.  She took her savings to invest in her immediate goal of carrying out her idea.\r\n\r\nShe now has a small business selling miscellaneous goods like stationery, women\u2019s accessories, costume jewelry, household items, and gifts.  She sells on credit and for cash.  Her clientele is comprised of neighbors from the area where she lives.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later is to open two more locations in adjacent neighborhoods where they still do not have this type of business.

Now, as a Babban Gona member, he finally has the opportunity to access credit, good markets and a trained agronomist. Like all Babban Gona members, Nathan can reap up to 30 bags of maize\/hectare, double the national average of 14 and earn up to $2000\/ha this season from growing maize, more than three times the Nigerian farmer\u2019s average annual income. By doing so, Nathan will finally have enough money to make significant life changes. When asked what he plans to do with his income from this season, he said: \u201cI plan to use the money I make to provide more food and clothing for my family\u201d.
