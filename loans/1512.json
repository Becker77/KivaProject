Meet James, a very hardworking, energetic and honest man who is 44 years of age. He lives in the rich highlands of Nyamira with his wife and 5 children. James has been practicing farming for the past 15 years and, through those years, he has been able to support his family. His primary sources of income are egg, tea, and crop farming. The Kisii area is populated and has a ready market for poultry products. However, James' biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. Poultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and you don\u2019t need to be a large scale farmer to benefit from it. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, James will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market. The demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in his area.\r\n\r\nJames has been facing challenges accessing finances but he feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. James chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loans is low and is on a reducing basis. James underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through the loan, James' income will increase and his life will permanently change, leading to better living conditions for his family and a positive impact to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1669627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-17T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-16T00:30:06Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2427.39},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2958.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3010.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3130.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3193.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3288.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3449.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3489.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3607.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3700.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3818.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3924.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.42,"local_amount":3319.78,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3467.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547641},{"amount":69.56,"local_amount":5857.84,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6117.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680643},{"amount":36.84,"local_amount":3102.32,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3240.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194005},{"amount":78.93,"local_amount":6646.56,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6941.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823419},{"amount":39.32,"local_amount":3311.57,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3458.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264041},{"amount":18.08,"local_amount":1522.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1589.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600184},{"amount":63.53,"local_amount":5375.86,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5614.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":665458791},{"amount":19.9,"local_amount":1759.92,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1838.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":681377046},{"amount":19.51,"local_amount":1737.58,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1814.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":696586895},{"amount":80.31,"local_amount":7366.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7693.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.17,"payment_id":711505121}],"funded_date":"2014-08-28T14:45:59Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":752577,"name":"Tamar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tamar is 40 years old.

He did not attend school because there was no school where he grew up, and since he was young, he has worked as a farmer and at aquaculture in ponds.\r\n\r\nHe is married and his wife does domestic work.  They have three children and live with them in their home.  Two help with farming and one is attending school.  All three depend on him.\r\n\r\nPedro has 35 years of experience doing this work, and he learned from his parents, who taught him when he was young.  He knows that this is work that is done year after year.  He realized that planting corn allowed him to save a lot on the food he provides to his family.  He also works in aquaculture and earns income when he sells his fish.  He works from 6:00am until 12:00pm.  \r\n\r\nHe is requesting this loan from CrediCampo to purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides to grow his corn crop.  This will allow him to manage his corn well so that he can have a good harvest.  He will be able to supply the needs of his family and he will sell anything extra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1668779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He swapped his studies for tools to fix bicycles, and applied himself at welding to earn his daily bread. Over time he realised that it was something he also loved doing, so at 21 years old he decided to study mechanics and start his own business as a mechanic and welder to immerse himself in the subject. Now, at 50 years old, he has been offering these services for three decades. From the beginning, this work has been his means of support and has enabled him to maintain his four children, who are 27, 26, 24 and 19 years old.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rey de Jes\u00fas has just one person working for him, together with his family who have always helped him. His goal is to keep growing, and to have a space in a large local market to ply his trade, but first he must keep on investing in his business. He therefore needs a loan in order to buy tools to maintain his welding machine. This will allow him to offer a better service and expand as far as he wants to meet his goals, with the aim of passing on an established business to his children. He also plans to extend his home.

It is made up of eight members and managed by board of directors chaired by Se\u00f1ora Cesaria. The members of the community bank run various businesses, including selling mobile phones, hot dogs and chips, food, vegetables, and wooden crafts, and buying and selling blankets, sewing duvets, and selling sandals.\r\n\r\nThe loan they take out will benefit small micro-entrepreneurs including Se\u00f1ora Cesaria. She says that she joined Pro Mujer ten years ago, after being invited by a friend who is a member of the organisation. She currently has a business selling sandals. She explains that she set this business up on her own initiative a number of years ago, after noting that it was a product which would always have a market. \r\n \r\nThe loan she is going to take out now is to increase capital (to buy wholesale sandals) which she will get from wholesalers in the city of El Alto. She will then sell them in her sales outlet. This way of work allows her to make money to support her family financially, as she has a partner and five children.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she replies that she likes the healthcare area offered by the organisation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1661557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale sandals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-08-17T12:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-16T12:30:01Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Amanda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald Dimar\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23576,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3533.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3786.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3870.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3975.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4083.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4327.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":577.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":593.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":628.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":513.26,"local_amount":3533.04,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T12:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530030175},{"amount":550.12,"local_amount":3786.77,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3801.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522394},{"amount":1139.82,"local_amount":7845.92,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7876.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561656037},{"amount":1221.8,"local_amount":8410.27,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8442.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579575023}],"funded_date":"2014-08-17T17:00:31Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chloe Pilpel","image":1214298}},{"id":743211,"name":"Rogers","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rogers is a 31-year-old married man with two children living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

The loan will be used to buy more cooking oil, charcoal, and Irish potatoes for the business. Justine hopes that the loan will help her to generate greater profits so she can assist her parents with their basic needs and also take care of her child. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a salon.\r\n\r\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

The association is made up of eleven members and led by a board, of which Liliana is the President. The businesses run by members of the association are varied and include selling cosmetics, selling shoes, a hardware store, weaving for overalls, a grocery store, a corner store, and selling gas.\r\n\r\nThe loan they obtain will benefit micro-entrepreneurs, including Liliana. She says that she has been a member of Pro Mujer for 17 years, after joining when she was invited by a friend who is a member of the association. Today she has a beauty salon: she says that she learned about this activity by studying in a technical institute, and over time and with a small amount of capital, she decided to start her own business.\r\n \r\nThe loan that she will now now obtain is to be used to increase her stock (buying cosmetics wholesale), which she will acquire from wholesale distributors in the city of El Alto and subsequently sell in her retail store. This form of work allows her to generate income to support her family financially, as she lives with her partner and her three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says she likes the area of \u200b\u200bhealth, training and microcredits offered by the institution. \r\n\r\nIn the photo one of the members is not present, as she was at the doctor's having tests."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6100,"image":{"id":1661725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-08-17T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-16T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":6100,"lender_count":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliana Noemy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erick Emilio\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abigail Selina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hiovana Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":42056,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":6100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4449.32},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4897.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5030.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5167.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5308.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5436.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5612.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6153.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":710.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":729.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":749.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":769.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":788.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":814.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":892.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1355.68,"local_amount":9346.64,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9367.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522396},{"amount":729.66,"local_amount":5030.6,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5041.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561656039},{"amount":4014.66,"local_amount":27678.76,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":27741.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579575025}],"funded_date":"2014-09-13T14:21:56Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stuart Mudie","image":null}},{"id":754937,"name":"Rosalina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Rostalina de 28 anos de idade nasceu em Magude, e\u2019 vi\u00fava e m\u00e3e de 4 filhos dos quais 1 frequenta a escola e n\u00e3o sustenta mais algu\u00e9m fora desses filhos. \n\u00c9 comerciante h\u00e1 mais de 6 anos e adquiriu a experiencia dos seus pais.\n Este e\u2019 seu 1 financiamento na Hluvuku e com o presente financiamento de 13.000,00 ir\u00e1 comprar arroz, farinha, a\u00e7\u00facar, \u00f3leo, feij\u00e3o e caldo no sentido de aumentar o volume de mercadoria.\nTem como sonhos desenvolver mais sua actividade comercial e melhorar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es da sua habita\u00e7\u00e3o, a falta de fundos para investir em suas aspira\u00e7\u00f5es tem sido seu maior desafio.\n\n","en":"Rostalina is 28 years old.

Meet Rose, a 28-year-old, very hardworking, honest and ever smiling mother of 6 children. She lives with her husband in the Kitale area of Kenya - an area known to have good weather patterns and which is always referred to as the \u201cbread basket of Kenya\u201d because half the food Kenya consumes is from this region. \r\n\r\nRose passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past 3 years and has always managed to provide for her family. Her primary source of income has been crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living.\r\n\r\nRose has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Rose, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms.\r\n\r\nRose said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions.\r\n\r\nRose hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. \r\n\r\nShe awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":468.46,"image":{"id":1669780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has 2 school-aged sons, a daughter and a husband. Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because she had to start working at a very young age, Nana was unable to pursue a professional career.\r\n\r\nNana works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing nuts and kiwis. She always has high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. As the family has only seasonal income, Nana decided to start dairy farming and seek credit among local financial institutions, but her attempts were unsuccessful because of her poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe start-up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables poor and inexperienced rural people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Her application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 2,000 GEL for purchasing a milk cow.\r\n\r\nAfter the cow is purchased the family will start producing dairy products such as cheese and yogurt to sell. They also use the milk products for family feeding. She is a very enthusiastic and hardworking person with a great desire to ensure a good education for her children so they may progress in life.  \r\n\r\nThis credit will be a great support for the family. Nana is thankful to Kiva Lenders for giving her a chance to generate income.

Although she loves crop farming she is more attached to dairy farming and she always says, \u201cDairy farming is close to my heart\u201d. She has nicknamed one of her cows \u201cMiso\u201d. In farming she enjoys the returns she gets but she is also faced with challenges of high living standards and inadequate capital to increase her dairy farming.\r\n\r\nEverline has excess space on her land and excess dairy feeds that are not being fully utilized and she wants to take advantage of this through acquiring a quality breed of dairy cattle. Dairy farming is one of the more profitable ventures in Kenya and has seen an upsurge in growth. Milk prices have been skyrocketing and this means increased income for farmers. Marketing of the milk will never be a problem for Everline because she has already identified the market and also she will be selling to large milk processing firms.\r\n\r\nAccessing funds has always been a problem for Everline but through institutions such as Juhudi kilimo and with the help of Kiva lenders she feels relieved because she knows her dream will become reality. When asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo, her reply was: \"Because the interest rates on their loans are low on a reducing basis and they also provide training to farmers who are seeking agricultural loans\u201d. She will also benefit from manure from the cow, hence saving money.\r\n\r\nProfits from selling milk will be used to fully repay the loan and to improve her living conditions and positively impact society."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1669808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-17T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-16T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.94,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2011.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2398.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2436.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2524.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2570.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2639.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2756.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2785.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2870.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3021.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3097.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.75,"local_amount":2798.65,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2879.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547643},{"amount":14.86,"local_amount":1269.72,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1306.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680645},{"amount":27.7,"local_amount":2367.75,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2436.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624928},{"amount":8.1,"local_amount":692.55,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":712.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194007},{"amount":51.7,"local_amount":4418.42,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4546.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823420},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":2483.28,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2555.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261919},{"amount":30.51,"local_amount":2607.39,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2683.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600186},{"amount":24.32,"local_amount":2182.98,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2246.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":681377048},{"amount":145.06,"local_amount":13229.26,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13613.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.72,"payment_id":731024375}],"funded_date":"2014-08-17T18:23:23Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":752646,"name":"Nairim","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nairim de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, habita con su esposo en el municipio de Soledad, lugar donde prepara un natural yogurt casero, el cual vende al por mayor y al detal.

She lives in a town close to the city of Barranquilla, where she has a general store that mainly sells stationary products.\r\n\r\nShe started her business 8 years ago when she noticed that this type of business did not exist in the neighborhood where she lives. With her savings, she decided to start it. The main products that she offers are stationary items to satisfy the demands of the schools that the children in the area attend. She conducts her sales in cash from Monday to Saturday from 9 in the morning until 9 at night.

She has been doing this work for twenty years and it generates a fair amount of money for her family's finances; it is the legacy her father was able to leave her so that she would have a better quality of life in the future.\r\n\r\nFrancisca will put to use the loan she is requesting by maintaining her banana trees so that they will produce their fruit, which will be taken to the community markets to be sold.\r\n\r\nA group of women decided to join together with Francisca in order to maximize the benefits of the land in their community, as it is full of life for producing any type of agricultural products.\r\n\r\nFrancisca's dream is to plant more banana trees on the fertile lands that she has; she wants to support the environment in this way, and at the same time, reap a financial benefit for her family so that they can become professionals in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":1669901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to maintain her banana trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Suchitep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-08-17T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-16T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":27000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":165.95,"local_amount":1298.74,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1299.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134597},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972374},{"amount":989.33,"local_amount":7742.58,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7744.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681268049},{"amount":1911.39,"local_amount":14958.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":14963.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477177}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T04:26:46Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:13:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":752706,"name":"Blanca Alicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Blanca de 65 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su grupo familiar en casa propia, es una mujer muy responsable, trabajadora y honrada, trabaja en su propia panader\u00eda en la que elabora pasteles y quesadillas, y sale a venderlo por la colonia donde reside, Do\u00f1a Blanca solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en la compra de harina, manteca, latas y todo lo necesario para poder producir m\u00e1s.

For 21 years she has been teaching Kyrgyz language and literature in a secondary school. Guliya's neighbors and colleagues speak highly of her, describining her as a kind and hard-working person. In spite of her small salary and pension, in the total amount of about 14,000 KGS per month, Guliya managed to start building a house. However, she lacks the means to pay the for inside and outside wall finishing work and isolation, for installing plastic window frames, and also for roofing in her future home. This is why Guliya has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy steel profiles, rods and beams needed for roofing and plastic window frames. Installing energy-efficient windows will allow her to lower the heating expenses and save up for her son's wedding. Guliya plans to finish construction work before this winter and move into her new house since as present her close-knit family lives in a studio apartment.

","en":"Paridakan is 58 years old and widowed.  She is the mother of three children, all of whom are grown and have families of their own.  Paridakan already has many grandchildren.  Her family is friendly and actively helps her manage her affairs.  Paridakan has a secondary education.  For 25 years she has worked in animal husbandry and agriculture, starting her business from scratch.  Thanks to Paridakan's hard work, her business has grown to include: 4 cows, 20 sheep, and 1.20 hectares of land, on which Paridakan grows clover and barley.  Her family's monthly income is about 20,000 KGS.  Income from her business, as well as saved funds, allowed Paridakan to begin building a house.

the children.  She has worked in a factory for a few years and lives on a low income.  Her eldest son is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation and helps his mother take care of the family.

Shuhrat lives with his family in a rural area.  He has a secondary, specialized education.

","en":"Aigul is 58 years old and she is married with one son, who gladly helps her around the house.  Aigul has a higher education and a wide work experience.  She is now a pensioner, but because of her small pension, she had to find an additional source of income four years ago.  So in 2010, she began to raise livestock, which she started with a sum of 6,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, Aigul now has one calf and two sheep.  Her monthly income is about 6,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 28,000 som (KGS) to buy hay and feed for her livestock and to make repairs on her barn.  Because of her catastrophically low income, Aigul had wanted to sell off her livestock to buy food, but she did a bit of accounting and realized that it would not make good business sense, as her income would drop even further.  For this reason, she has gone to the bank.  She plans to expand her business and save up for her son's wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1671076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

raised in a rural region. She is married and has two children.   Since childhood she has been accustomed to work, and now works in animal husbandry.  Like everyone who lives in her rural area, her business is in cattle and sheep.  Additionally, she teaches school.  Her husband, Bozorboy, recently moved to Russia for work because their children are growing up and they need money to finish their house and pay for schooling.  Feruza and her husband work very hard for the good of their family - Feruza is a very hardworking woman.  As soon as she finishes work, she begins looking after the cattle and feeding them because, thanks to their work in livestock, their lives are improving.  Feruza would like to repair her unfinished house, and put in plastic windows and doors.  It is no wonder Feruza wants to install these windows - plastic windows keep heat in the house; additionally, they keep out dust and noise.  Feruza does not have sufficient funds for these windows and doors, and thus turned to \"Arvand\" for help.  Feruza is hopeful of a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for its support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1668074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

The current business earns her about 40,000 KHR per day to meet the family\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nSreyven\u2019s group consists of two members who are female and in the same village. She is in her loan cycle with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund, and she has completely repaid her past loan, which enabled her to better support her family and have some money. Now leading her group of two to apply for a loan, Sreyven will use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland. She hopes that this loan will enable her to earn more income from her current business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1654904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Cheung Prey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-08-17T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-16T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sreyven","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuthea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":600000},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":608250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595343893},{"amount":500,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2027500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681551918}],"funded_date":"2014-08-26T20:07:20Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T17:38:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Neil Garvin","image":835015}},{"id":743631,"name":"Sarom's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A citizen from a rural area located in the Moung Russey district where rice farming is a common way to earn a living, Sarom is aged 33 years and married.

She is very kind and hardworking.  Iroda is married and has two children.  Iroda was born and grew up in a village where children from childhood are accustomed to hard work.  After her wedding, Iroda moved to her current home.  Iroda's husband, Nizomidine, works in Russia.  Iroda has been working in sales for six years.  She sells inexpensive women's and men's shoes at the market.  Iroda is able to meet all of her responsibilities, including those in the home and related to raising her children, as well as those associated with her small business.  She has a sufficient number of clients, and her shop is in a good location.  Iroda hopes to expand her business and diversify the goods that she sells.

He is married and has two children.  He first turned to Arvand when he learned that he had a chance to receive financial assistance.  Zafar lives with his family in a village.  He does not have a higher education because, due to financial difficulties in his family, he never had the chance to study at university.  Zafar's wife also lacks an education.  She is a homemaker, and works around the house and raises the children.  In order to earn money for food, Zafar runs his own business fattening and selling cattle.  Zafar also works as a handyman.  From his business he receives a good income.  Zafar's wife also helps with the business by selling milk from the cattle.  Zafar now hopes to expand his business by increasing his number of cattle.

She has a higher education and has worked for 25 years as a secretary in agricultural management.  She has also worked for many years in animal husbandry and agriculture.  In 2011, Zhanylbubu's home was damaged by floods and was no longer habitable.  Zhanylbubu's family saved money to build a new house, and now all that remains is to insulate and finish the external walls of the house.  Zhanylbubu turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 60,000 KGS to purchase plenoplex (material for insulation), plaster, and other items.  Once her home is completed, Zhanylbubu plans to begin building sheds for cattle.

","en":"Nazirjon is a cheerful, hardworking 24-year-old who is married and has one child.  He and his wife are quite happy together, and hope to raise their children to be good people.  To support his family, Namirjon sells nutritious dried fruits, and has done so for two years already; he used to work on a farm, and decided one day that he'd like to try selling his own produce.
