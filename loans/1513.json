Rainy season rice cropping on one hectare of farmland and a paid job at a construction site are the main sources of her family\u2019s income to deal with their financial burden. This business earns her about 38,900 Cambodia riels (KHR) per day after several years involvement in the current business. Now, Sen leads a group of two to get a second loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s field partner); both of them have fully repaid their past loans. As a leader she will spend her loan portion to buy fertilizer and rice seed for replanting.

woman.  She is 56 years old and married with two children, who have already live on their own and have started their own families.  Muribat lives in a small village and she has dreamed of becoming a teacher since she was a child, but because of her difficult circumstances and her family's financial shortcomings, she was not able to receive a higher education.  She married immediately after high school and became a housewife, but even though she is always at home, Muribat is never idle.  She and her husband try to do whatever they can to make sure their needs are met.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain a steady stream of income for their daily needs, Muribat and her husband have started their own business raising livestock.  She raises the livestock and then sells their milk and butter.  Muribat makes a decent income from this business.  Her husband works as a handyman and his income brings in a bit extra to the family.  Their combined income is enough to keep them living at an average level, but they don't yet have enough to take care of all of their needs.  At the moment, Muribat and her husband want to increase the head of livestock they raise.  For this reason, she has turned to Arvand to get a loan to purchase cattle.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their support, which makes it possible for her to improve her quality of

This way, he can obtain profits to support his family so they can have adequate living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe change that the loan will bring is mainly to ensure the harvest with the materials and general management of the harvests, People can obtain better quality products and what has happened with Enrique is that with the loans he has been able to obtain better harvests. \r\n\r\nOne of his goals is building houses for his children for adequate living conditions and education for his children so that they can have good professions in life and keep harvesting the fertile land in his community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1670081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy potato seeds and chemical fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-08-18T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-17T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.23,"local_amount":414.19,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":432.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542417112},{"amount":15.79,"local_amount":118.39,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":123.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561554886},{"amount":9.94,"local_amount":74.56,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":77.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579463830},{"amount":30.04,"local_amount":225.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070508},{"amount":30.97,"local_amount":232.31,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":242.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612113488},{"amount":25.95,"local_amount":194.65,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":203.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624776763},{"amount":29.93,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":234.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134069},{"amount":202.15,"local_amount":1516.13,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1582.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489203}],"funded_date":"2014-08-18T14:02:08Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:06:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":752841,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos es una estudiante de Derecho, actualmente vive con sus padres, trabaja en una lomiteria como cocinero por las noches y por las tardes estudia en la universidad para ser abogado.\nSu objetivo con este pr\u00e9stamo es pagar sus cuotas del semestre para poder culminar la carrera y convertirse en un flamante abogado luchador de la justicia de los derechos humanos.

He lives in the town of Liborina with his wife and 3 grown-up children. He is a very hardworking man who has, for some time now, worked in his shop selling a variety of merchandise such as clothing and accessories such as torches, pencils and other things. This allows him to supplement the income he earns from his pigs which he fattens and raises. His business involves buying and selling these types of goods around the town. He sells his goods in the street and when a customer requests something he always tries to deliver it to them quickly, in spite of the long distances he has to cover to reach his customers.

","en":"Dildora was born in 1985.  She was born and raised in a family of a simple farmer in northern Tajikistan.  After finishing her secondary education, Dildora could not go to university, and was unable to get a higher education.  Because her husband makes only a small income, after her marriage Dildora started her own business raising cattle and sewing women's clothing.  Dildora has been working in animal husbandry for more than 8 years; she fattens cattle and sheep and sells milk, meat, and wool to the locals.  She has gradually developed her business and improved her quality of life.  She has 4 children who are still small.  Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.  Dildora plans to repair her cowshed and barn, and in this way hopes to improve her living conditions.  She is asking for a loan of 5000 TJS to purchase building materials.

His family has a pair of cattle for their own needs, so he already has experience raising livestock.  Shokirjon is married and has two children.  His wife is a homemaker, so Shokirjon is the single earner in the family.  Shokirjon already has feed for cattle, but lacks the funds to buy the actual cattle.  He is asking for a loan in order to purchase livestock and start his business.  Shokirjon will keep the cattle in his own, large, old barn, and will fatten the cattle for 1-2 months.

Now, her production has increased, which has generated more income to cover her family's expenses and her children's education costs. \r\n\r\nThe financing they have received from the Fundaci\u00f3n has been very helpful. She says that it has improved her and her family's living conditions. She will invest in pigs, animal feed and concentrates. In addition, she will make some repairs to the place where she keeps the pigs. \r\n\r\nTogether with Marla, there are three more members who will invest the loan in animal husbandry activities (pigs and chickens). They all strive for the same goal: growing their businesses and getting ahead to improve their quality of life and that of their families.

las tareas agr\u00edcolas todos los d\u00edas por las ma\u00f1anas, ya que por las tardes asist\u00eda a la escuela donde curso hasta el 4\u00b0 grado, motivo por el cual ya no continuo sus estudios,  fue porque su padre una persona de edad muy avanzada  comenz\u00f3 a sentirse mal de salud hasta el punto que falleci\u00f3 y fue \u00e9l quien desde ese momento retomo el puesto de su padre  en el cual le tocaba trabajar muy fuerte para satisfacer las necesidades de su familia, la cual est\u00e1 compuesta por su madre y sus 3 hermanas. Desde entonces Alejandro se dedica a los trabajos de la agricultura y al destazo de cerdos, actividad a la cual se suman su madre y sus hermanas.  \n\nAlejandro realiza el trabajo de la agricultura desde los 15 a\u00f1os, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 de su padre quien con mucho orgullo trabajaba y cultivaba.\n\nAlejandro, en la actividad se dedica al comercio en compra y venta de verduras y productos b\u00e1sicos y  todos los fines de semana se dedica al destazo de cerdos la cual se ha convertido en su principal fuente de ingresos, ya que tiene 6 meses de haber comenzado con esta actividad.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que est\u00e1 solicitando a CREDICAMPO,  es para comprar zanahorias, g\u00fcisquil, lechugas, r\u00e1banos, ejotes, papas, pl\u00e1tanos, etc. y en consolidar una deuda personal, de esta forma mejorara su negocio y sus ingresos y prestara un mejor servicio a sus clientes.\n\nLas proyecciones que tiene para un futuro son las de tener un veh\u00edculo,  para trasportar su mercader\u00eda y le permita llevar su negocio a otros caser\u00edos de su comunidad, mejorar su vivienda comenzar a montar una granja de cerdos y de gallinas ponedoras.\n\n\n","en":"Alejandro is 37 years old. He is a very polite and responsible person with a great personality. He is a farmer which his father taught him. He lived with his father who he helped with the farming duties every day in the mornings. In the afternoons he attended school until the 4th grade. He couldn't continue studying because his father was elderly and his health began to deteriorate and he passed away. Alejandro took over for his father and began working very hard to provide for his family which is made up of his mother and his three sisters. Since then he has done the farming duties and the butchering of pigs, which his mother and sisters also help with. He began working in farming 15 years ago and learned from his father who worked with pride.\r\n\r\nAlejandro also buys and sells vegetables and basic products. He works every weekend butchering pigs which has become his main source of income, and he's been doing this for 6 months.\r\n\r\nThe loan he's asking for from CREDICAMPO is to buy carrots, chayote, lettuce, radishes, green beans, potatoes, bananas, etc. He will also use it to consolidate a personal debt which will improve his business, increase his earnings and he will be able to provide a better service to his customers.\r\n\r\nHis future projections include having a vehicle to transport goods which will allow him to take his business to other villages within his community. He would like to make home improvements and to start a pig and hen

She makes a living doing housework in her home and she makes a living raising and selling fattening chickens.  Martha lived and grew up with her parents who were very humble and hard-working people who also made a living selling chickens and eggs since they worked in their own laying hen farm.  Her family consisted of three siblings of which she was the oldest meaning that she had to help with the chores around the house and the farm.\r\nMartha makes a living doing the domestic activities in her home, which she learned from her parents, since she was 12 and she also makes a living raising fattening chickens and selling eggs since she has a farm with 50 laying hens and 50 fattening chickens.  She has been doing this for over 10 years and will continue to do it since it has become the principal source of income which gives them profits to satisfy the basic necessities of her children.  Her husband joins her in this activity during the afternoons, since in the morning he works in agriculture.\r\nThe money will be used to buy chickens and laying hens, since those that she has have surpassed their useful lives and she has to buy more hens and chickens and also part of the money will be invested in bicycle parts since her husband has started to offer this service which will bring them new income for the family.\r\nHer dreams for the future are to have a farm with better equipment and get a new loan to buy an incubator and in this way have more income, to support  the education of her son, and to support her husband to improve the equipment in his

Murodgul's husband is a migrant worker and he is currently in Russia.  For this reason, Murodgul takes care of her children's education  alone.  At the same time, she is involved in animal husbandry at home.  She started to raise cows and young bulls for resale a year ago and was initiated into the business by her brother-in-law.   According to Murodgul, what she likes the most about this activity is the fact that it always provides her with milk and dairy products, as well as with a stable income.  Murodgul plans to use the amount of her loan to buy a few head of young cattle in order to increase her number of domestic animals.  She is hoping to receive some support, which will help her to expand her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1672336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a few head of young cattle to increase her herd.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dangara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-08-19T03:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-18T03:30:15Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Murodgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":690.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":703.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":754.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":768.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":778.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":817.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":854.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":855.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":905.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":922.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":950.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":997.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":139.9,"local_amount":690.88,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":697.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542569355},{"amount":142.47,"local_amount":703.58,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":710.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561701325},{"amount":152.74,"local_amount":754.27,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579637931},{"amount":155.72,"local_amount":768.98,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":776.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595214547},{"amount":1434.17,"local_amount":7082.29,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7150.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610609922}],"funded_date":"2014-09-17T14:22:11Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:28:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":752890,"name":"Shodigul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shodigul is a hard-working married father of three who lives in a rural area with his family.

They have an average age of 32 and two children.  They all live in the Ouolofobougou neighborhood in the Third commune of Bamako, the capital of Mali.  They met through their neighborhood savings groups and their income-generating activities.  The group members have been engaging in different income-generating activities, including the sale of onions, atikeke, fresh fish, and charcoal, for over 10 years. To expand and grow their businesses, they decided to join Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first group loan.  Ms. Ahissa (at the far left of the photo) enjoys a good reputation because onion is a very popular vegetable among women in the Ouolofobougou market. She plans to use her loan to buy three bags of onions and 10 bags of charcoal.  She buys her supplies at the main market in Medine and at the weekly village fairs.  She sells for credit to a clientele of women in Ouolofobougou. She expects to earn an average monthly profit of 35,000 FCFA that will be used to meet her needs and reinvested in her business. Her goal is to maintain a loyal partnership with Soro Yiriwaso to benefit from many loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1674166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy onions and charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"District de Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-19T12:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-18T12:30:01Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.53,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahissa                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saran      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kankou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T16:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":167286.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530210705},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167286.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542659096},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":167286.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793304},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":167286.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758210},{"amount":330.5,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":167286,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.16,"payment_id":595318761},{"amount":319.29,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":167285.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.37,"payment_id":610752558}],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T14:54:43Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T13:05:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":753350,"name":"Grupo La Gran Familia Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el departamento de Suchitep\u00e9quez, durante 4 a\u00f1os, Dalia, mujer soltera de 43 a\u00f1os, se ha dedicado elaboraci\u00f3n de cortes.

Poultry farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and can be done on a part-time basis as you do other farming activities. She always says that, \u201cto be a good poultry farmer you need to know the different breeds of chicken, chicken feeds and how to prevent disease.\u201d Emmy is confident that through the loan she will be able to sell her poultry to the ready market that is there. She believes that through poultry farming her life will permanently change because poultry farming has so many advantages. You can sell eggs, poultry meat, and poultry feathers. Marketing of poultry products will never be a problem for Emmy because the demand for chicken is always high. It is a popular meal for many people, which is proven by visiting any fast food restaurant. Emmy feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that assist aspiring women in achieving their dreams. Emmy chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on the loan is low and is on a reducing basis. She completed training through Juhudi Kilimo. During the training session, she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Profits from the business will be used to fully repay the loan, to improve her living conditions, and to assure her children of a secure future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1670240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-19T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-18T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2141.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2223.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2259.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2320.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2448.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2528.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2582.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2661.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2723.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2797.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2875.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.27,"local_amount":4823.34,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4949.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624929},{"amount":27.39,"local_amount":2347.37,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2408.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194008},{"amount":55.13,"local_amount":4725.49,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4848.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261920},{"amount":58.37,"local_amount":5003.57,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5134.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600187},{"amount":47.11,"local_amount":4241.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4351.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"payment_id":681377049},{"amount":9.76,"local_amount":884.43,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":907.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"payment_id":696586896},{"amount":17.2,"local_amount":1605.95,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.54,"payment_id":711505123},{"amount":70.09,"local_amount":6368.73,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6534.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.21,"payment_id":752110417}],"funded_date":"2014-08-19T14:30:34Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":755715,"name":"Nienta Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Constitu\u00e9 de quatre (4) femmes, les membres du groupe Nienta sont uniquement  mari\u00e9es et vie dans des m\u00e9nages monogamiques.

Meet Carren who is a wife, a mother of 3 children, farmer and a member of Kalong Vision self-help group in the Litein area of Kenya. She is very active in running her farm as well as the day-to-day activities of the group. She has 8 years of experience in farming and over the years she has enjoyed dairy farming the most because of the regular income generated. Litein area is a very remote area and Carren has been facing challenges transporting her farm produce to the market because of poor feeder roads. Milk and vegetables are perishable products and require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and because Carren has been lacking a good transportation system, she has been facing losses. Carren is seeking funds to buy a motorbike to transport her farm produce to the market.\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is a micro finance field partner that works with partners such as Kiva to afford marginal farmers access financial services that they otherwise cannot get because of the loan requirement. Through the loan Carren will be able to timely deliver her products to the market and she will never suffer losses from her milk going bad or vegetables not being fresh. Timely delivery of products will increase her earnings and therefore permanently change her life.

Reselling livestock allows Jumagul to purchase school supplies and clothing for her children. She values every earned penny. \r\n\r\nJumagul is requesting this loan to buy livestock.

Anorgul will sell home improvement supplies such as wallpaper, paint, dry mixes, putty, brushes, and so forth. Her son is an entrepreneur and will help her run the new business. She does not have the capital to purchase inventory and open the store, so she applied for a loan of $2000 (USD).

She can make ends meet only with monthly assistance from local government. Sadly, because of a lack of economic resources, Makvala was unable to follow a professional career, and she can't find a stable job. Her income is barely enough for her to confront her financial difficulties. Accordingly, Makvala decided to become involved in her own trading business. She needs financial support to purchase a stock of clothing and begin trading locally. She applied for a loan from local financial institutions several times to start up her trading business, but without any success. Her loan application was rejected every time, because the lenders did not find the existing family income sufficient to justify approving the loan. Makvala applied for a loan from Credo and was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program provides startup credit on soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products. The loan will be great support for Makvala, enabling her to generate her own income and build a  better style of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1670378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
