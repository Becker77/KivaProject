where the owner quickly promoted him to a shift manager position. Two years later, Romulo became general manager for the store. He saw that his hard work was earning the company a lot of money, and he realized that he could own his own business.\n\n\u201cI thought that with hard work and with what I have learned as a general manager, I could be my own boss and make my own money for myself and my family,\u201d he said. \n\nRomulo opened Salsas Mexican Grill last October in Haltom City, Texas. He said he and his wife chose to offer Mexican cuisine because that is what they know best, and because there weren\u2019t many Mexican restaurants in the area.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had many clients tell us that they were glad we opened where we did so they didn\u2019t have to drive so far to get to a Mexican restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, everything we serve is fresh \u2013 fresh tomatoes, fresh onions, fresh chili peppers, fresh meat, so we have lots of happy customers.\u201d \n\nSalsas Mexican Grill seats up to 50 people and offers a traditional Tex-Mex breakfast, lunch and dinner menu six days a week.\n\nHis business is growing steadily, but Romulo wanted to make an investment so he could grow it more quickly. So, he turned to a bank for a loan so he could pay for advertising and buy more equipment, including a new grill. \n\n\u201cThe bank said I didn\u2019t have enough of a credit history, and that they couldn\u2019t take a risk on me,\u201d he said. \n\nAs luck would have it, Romulo was listening to the radio when he heard an advertisement about Accion Texas. So, he applied and was able to gain approval for his loan.\n\nOpening a business is not easy, he said. \n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of patience and there are many issues to resolve, from paperwork and inspections to getting funding, but if you\u2019re going to open a business, you cannot get discouraged,\u201d Romulo said. \n\n\u201cFortunately, Accion Texas exists to help people who want to get their business started and move it forward, and the people there are willing to listen and help.\u201d \n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1668339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay for advertising and more equipment, including a new grill.

Meet Francis, who is 32 years of age, a hard worker and a very honest farmer. He hails from the rich Kisii highlands in Kenya; an area that has good rainfall patterns and is known for banana farming. There, a staple food is \u201c matoke\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. Francis has one child whom he adores and cherishes, and a beautiful wife who always paints a smile on Francis' face. \r\n\r\nFrancis has been practicing mixed farming for the past six years and through all those years he has been making great strides. Through profits he has been able to earn a decent and honest living. Francis generates income through milk selling, egg selling and personal business. Through these ventures, he has been able to send his child to school and afford a plate of food. . \r\n\r\nFrancis has planted many trees in his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow. As a result of this, Francis has been making a lot of profits through milk-selling. The demand has really increased, and he cannot meet it. That is why he is requesting kindly for a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture and Francis wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Francis is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Also, food for his dairy cows will never be a problem because he has planted Napier grass. Through increased profits, Francis is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. \r\n\r\nFrancis, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment. Juhudi Kilimo through its training has helped Francis have a saving culture and through accumulated profits, he plans to add value to his milk through packaging. Also he hopes that one day he will start manufacturing milk products such as yoghurt and cream.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1670415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is married, has two dependent children, and works as an electrician at a local factory. His wife works in a sewing shop and earns a small income. He and his wife have always dreamed of giving their children a decent education and try their best to make sure their children grow up to be educated people. \r\n\r\nNow Nasibullo's eldest son has finished high school and wants to apply to the medical college. He dreams of becoming a good doctor and helping people. The family will need to pay for the first year of his tuition, but Nasibullo does not have such a large sum of money available immediately.

She is from one of the municipalities of Chinandega, which is in the western part of the country.  Yadira is known for being an enterprising, responsible woman who has a great desire to better herself.  Additionally, she is a small business owner and operator of a restaurant located in her home where she sells a variety of common dishes a la carte, and on the weekends she makes delicious chicken soup with meatballs, beef with crab and tripe, and delicious beef with yucca, natural soft drinks, sodas, and juices, among others.  She does her buying in the markets and bulk distributors of Chinandega, which are cash-only.  She has regular and occasional customers and her sales are in cash.  She starts her day very early so she can have breakfast ready, followed by lunch and dinner, so her customers will not be waiting to try her delicious food.  She started her business as a way of getting her children ahead as a single mother and having income for her household.  One of her dreams is to be able to see her children become professionals, to improve her home, and to expand her business more so that in the not-so-distant- future she will have better income.  For these reasons, she is requesting another loan to invest in working capital to buy raw material to make her delicious dishes, such as rice, oil, beans, sugar, fruit, salt, sodas, meat (chicken, pork, beef), bananas, and firewood, among others, so she can offer different dishes and provide her customers with better service.  Yadira is very thankful for the support Kiva's lenders offer to people with limited financial resources.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1671758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials, such as rice, sugar, oil, firewood, meat (chicken, beef, pork), sodas, juices, and fruit, among other ingredients to make her delicious dishes.

Abdugaffor and his wife love their children very much and they try to give everything from their heart because they want their children to have a good upbringing.  However, their income is not enough to cover all of the family's needs, which is why Abdugaffor has started a side business as a handyman (repairing homes).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Abdugaffor and his wife want to make repairs to their home so they can improve their living conditions, but they don't have enough money for this project.

She was born and lives in a small village. She is not yet married and lives with her parents in a small house. She does not have a higher education and did not have the opportunity to go to college after high school because of her family's financial problems.

Umeda has applied for a consumer loan with Arvand. She and her family are improving their house so that they can comfortably live in it.

Ibrahim, from Suneka a remote village in the rich highland of Kisii, is an active and progressive farmer of his locality. He has a wife and four children and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops and personal business and he has been practicing farming for the past 30 years. Having done farming for such a long time he has gained so much experience and he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Ibrahim wants to take advantage of the market,  therefore he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Ibrahim has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. Ibrahim always says that, \u201cto become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers\u201d. He has planted so many trees on his farm that dairy food will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan he will not only benefit from milk but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm,  saving money that would have been spent in buying fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIbrahim has been facing challenges in accessing finances but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Ibrahim chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Ibrahim underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and during the training season, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions.\r\n\r\nThrough accumulated profits he plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. He plans that through increased income he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1670496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is married to Satyendranath, aged 54, who cultivates his land and grows vegetables. They are blessed with two sons. As Minibala and her husband could not provide a proper education to her sons, they work as masons.\r\n\r\nMinibala's husband tills his small plot of land and works tirelessly on his land to grow quality vegetables. The money he earns adds to their household incomes and is saved for their future. But it is quite insufficient. Moreover, their sons also do not have consistent income. So, in order to strengthen the family economy, Minibala started rearing cattle a few years back. She purchased one cow and started her milk supply business. Her neighbors are her main customers. She understands inflation, and the growing needs of her family and children cannot be met with their current earnings. Moreover, the demand of her customers is also increasing gradually, so she has decided to purchase one more cow to improve her milk supply business.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner), which helps the needy rural women by giving business loans. This loan amount will help Minibala to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nThe additional money earned from the business will contribute toward improving their savings and providing for her children and family.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to her generous lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1670178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow for her existing milk supply business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-20T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-19T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minibala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-20T05:18:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":753082,"name":"Ilanthendral Shg - Vadakarai Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"People Action for Transformation (PAT) manages the Ilanthendral Self Help Group, which consists of 10 members.

Hence, he has to put in extra efforts to comfortably take care of his family, but his low income is the main challenge.  \r\n\r\nSo, in order to help her husband, Suman engaged in a milk-selling business. She rears one cow and sells milk to her neighbours. She has achieved a reputation with her customers, as she sells milk at a cheaper rate.\r\n\r\nSuman is a visionary and enterprising woman and has always wanted to do dairy farming on a large scale, but one of the challenges she has faced is the lack of enough capital.

positive and responsible man.  He is 51 years old and he is married with four children.  He lives with his family in a small village, but the home in which he lives is in poor condition and was not built well enough for his family.  Mahsud's wife is a homemaker, and she is a very hard-working and caring mother.  Mahsud himself is employed in a local workshop, in which he has worked for a long time and he makes a decent living.  His income is just enough for his family to get by on.\r\n\r\nBut Mahsud has a dream; he wants to build a big home for his family.  But he doesn't have enough money to make this dream a reality.  His income is not enough to build this new home, which is why he turned to Arvand for a loan to buy the building materials to construct this home.

of Jalpaiguri. She is illiterate and can only sign her name. Her husband Arun, aged 58 years, is also illiterate. They live with their two sons. Their sons are also deprived of education due to their poor economic resources. Now one of them works in a tailoring shop and the other in a grocery shop.\r\n\r\nShe is a hardworking mother who struggles hard and tries to give her children everything they need. Saraswati and her husband both are engaged in a business of making bori (a conical ball made of pulses) used in vegetable curry in India. They sell the products in the local market and to their neighbors, relatives and friends, and earn for their family. They work hard to generate income for their everyday expenses. Yet their income is too low to give sufficient financial sustenance to their family.\r\n\r\nSaraswati is requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase ingredients for making more boris, in order to expand their business. She expects a boost in her business, which will generate more income. She dreams to earn more profit from her business and hopes to have a comfortable life and further expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to BJS and Kiva."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1670583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase necessary ingredients for their existing business of making \"bori\" (a conical ball made of pulses).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-20T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-19T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saraswati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-20T18:21:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":753166,"name":"Musarat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musarat has expertise in embroidery and has used her skill to provide for her family for many years now.

husband and two children (one son and one daughter).  She is 42 years old and illiterate, only able to sign her name. Both her children are students of different grades in secondary level.  They have a mud and bamboo-made house which lacks all the basic facilities.\r\n\r\nHer husband Narayan, aged 47 years, works as a daily laborer under a building contractor. However, the seasonal nature of this work and its unreliability leaves his family financially vulnerable.

He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of raw materials, repair the netting on his looms, and make improvements to his workshop. \r\n\r\nGregorio has been selling through NOVICA since 2004. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My grandmother would take me to buy wool. She'd wash it, card it, spin it and dye the yarn. This job is traditionally done by women. By the age of 12, I could reach the pedals of the handloom. Ever since, I've woven rugs, and now my sons have also learned our craft. My favorite patterns are of mountains and rows of diamonds because they remind me a lot of my father. I feel proud that my sons also weave.

This village is located in Myanmar's dry zone, where insufficient rainfall is very common. Most villagers are Buddhist and struggle finding access to affordable credit, as the state-owned agricultural bank is not active in the area.  Due to the lack of job opportunities in the village, some villagers will go to other countries, such as Thailand, as construction workers to support their families.  Others are forced to migrate to urban centers to become traders.  \r\n\r\nThose who stay are mainly farmers who grow wheat, sunflowers, paddy, and various beans. Sesame and pigeon peas are the highest yielding crops for farmers. These farmers aspire to use their loans to buy agricultural inputs that will boost their crop yields and, therefore, their crop sales.  The villagers hope to use their additional crop income to mend the road in the village, as the poorly maintained road makes it difficult for people to travel to their farms and other cities. \r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from Kyu Chan Village CBO: U Tin, U Win, U Sein, and U San.

They are on their fifth loan; the previous four loans were all fully repaid. Karidia, standing second from left in the photo, grows rice. With her loan, she plans to buy inputs and seeds and to pay for the labor costs and weeding of 2.5 hectares of land. After the harvest, the output is sold at the village level, in the market, to a clientele of men and women. She expects to earn a profit of 290,000 FCFA per season.

She is requesting a loan to be able to pay for her tuition fees. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Rebeca, I am nineteen years old and I live in Casa de Alto, a rural community in Pimentel, which belongs to the province of San Francisco de Macor\u00eds. I am the youngest of four siblings and we have all been living with my grandmother since we were very young because our mother died and my father does not have a stable job and cannot support us. The little money he earns comes from informal jobs.\r\n\r\nI would like to study at the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Nordestana (UCNE), which is located in San Francisco de Macor\u00eds, a bit far from where I live. I would like to study Civil Engineering, because I love that profession and everything related to buildings and construction works. Besides, I am good with numbers.\r\n\r\nI have been studying for six months now, since I received a scholarship thanks to my great efforts. However, I am not able to pay for the remaining expenses. I need this loan because I do not have enough money to finish my professional studies. This loan would have a great influence on my life because I would be able to become a professional and become a better person who can be an example for other people in the future, teaching them that in order to make one\u2019s dreams come true, one must work hard and knock on some doors.\r\n\r\nMy goals are to become a professional in order to improve my and my grandmother\u2019s living conditions. Also, to be able to help other young people like me who do not have the resources to study but really want to do so. After finishing my studies, I want to work as an engineer and my dream is to have my own construction company in the future. I would be able to employ newly graduated students and give them my hand, in the same way that, I hope, I will be given one.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1671897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Her biggest vision is to have a business selling clothes for men and women. \r\n\r\nThe group \u201cEsperanza y Progreso\u201d wants to thank the Kiva lenders that made this loan possible. \r\n\r\nElvira is in the back row, the second one from the left, she wears a purple polo and carries a baby in her arms. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5075,"image":{"id":1671908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sugar, corn, cinnamon, and disposable cups","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaycan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.083333 -76.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2014-08-20T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-19T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noemi Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Katia Sarai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helen Yulisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sol Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":14100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3525},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3525},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3525},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3525}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1268.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1268.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1268.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1268.75,"local_amount":3525,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3533.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542509114},{"amount":1268.75,"local_amount":3525,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3533.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561642534},{"amount":1268.75,"local_amount":3525,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3533.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579553030},{"amount":1268.75,"local_amount":3525,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3533.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595153593}],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T02:12:51Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Luisa Islas","image":null}},{"id":753488,"name":"Gilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Gilda works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a butcher shop business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from nipa roofing making. \r\n\r\nGilda is borrowing PHP 20000 through NWTF to purchase additional kilos of meat to sell at her butcher shop.
