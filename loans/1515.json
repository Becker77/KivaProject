However, she is only interested in working and showing that nobody knows the land better than she does. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy inputs such as fertilizer, irrigation and seeds to prepare the land. This loan is vitally important to Ana to enable her to continue working her land despite the uncertainty of it not being legalised. She is well aware that her two children of 6 and 11 need to eat and need a mother with strong drive to move forward in life. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her land legalized and move forward both economically and spiritually with her two children. \r\n\r\nPlease help this businesswoman who works every day irrespective of the weather or her state of health in search of a good future for her two children.

In February of 2011, he used the resources of his aunt to buy a display cabinet and stock it.  He began noticing that his sales went up each time and therefore he started to reinvest the profits in his business.  He has been paying back his aunt little by little, and he has been able to buy more display cabinets.  Today his goal is to expand and structure his business better and better since he has to put together enough money to study.  \r\n\r\nPresently he is applying for a loan from Kiva, the first loan that he has gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy stationary such as pens, notebooks, and school supplies, among other things, to continue to sell directly to his clients for cash or on credit.

He hails from Makimeny village in the rural town of Siongiroi. He has a beautiful wife and together they have five children whom they value and love. Being raised in a humble background has nurtured David to practice humility and patience in life, and that what it takes to be a successful farmer. David never got any formal employment and has been practicing farming as a source of livelihood for the past 20 years. Through those years he has been making good profits. Being a very ambitious farmer, all the profits that he gets in farming he reinvests back into his farm and uses the rest to support his family and parents. \r\n\r\nDavid passionately loves dairy farming and this can be shown through the nickname he has given his cow \u201ccheniaj\u201d which makes him proud whenever he is milking the cow.\r\n\r\nDavid has a very expansive land and has planted trees and Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow. As a result of this he has always wanted to buy more dairy cows but has been facing challenges of lack of funds; that is why he is seeking funds to buy a quality dairy cow. David plans not to just buy an ordinary dairy cow but plans to buy a quality breed that will be producing between 10-15 liters of milk a day.\r\n\r\nDemand for milk has gone up and David has been unable to meet the demand but through the loan he will be able to meet the milk demand in his village. David has a vision of accumulating more profits and opening a large milk-selling business where he will be selling milk products such as cream and yoghurt. Through the loan he will improve his living conditions and impact society positively through creating employment in his farm and milk shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1671251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

25 year old young man, is very well known in his community for the activity that he is engaged in.  He is a very helpful person, and belongs to a group of young persons called \u201cGuardianes Ambientalistas\u201d[Environmental Guardians, a group of children, young people, and adults engaged in preserving the environment and improving living conditions through activities such as recycling*], and serves as president of this group.  He was raised with his parents and grandparents and has devoted most of his life to his academic training.  Currently, he is enrolled in his third year of university study.  He studies three days a week and he spends the other days working in computer repair and maintenance.  \r\n\r\nEdwin has three years\u2019 experience repairing computers, an activity he learned from his older brother who now lives in the United States.  He taught him to work and, motivated by the profits and customers, he decided to continue the business that his brother left.\r\n\r\nToday, the young man is studying in his final year and will graduate with a degree in social work.  In this way, he will be able to have steady employment and improve income for himself and his family.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money to purchase tools and materials to perform his computer repair job more efficiently, and he will use the other part of his loan for the graduation expenses of his degree.  In this way, he will see his dreams become a reality.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he plans to have a bigger location stocked with supplies where he can hire two additional employees and offer better service. In this way, he will have better income and will be able to pay off the loan, and then make another application to expand and improve his business.  He will also purchase a vehicle because he has to travel to the schools that contract his services, and it is difficult to transport his work equipment.

hardworking 56-year-old man. Ibragim has a very large family. He is married and has six children. Ibragim and his family live in a rural village. He is involved in his own business to have an income for living. He has been involved in growing agricultural crops and onions for 10 years. He then gathers the harvest, takes it to a large market and sell it there.\r\n\r\nHe was previously involved in dekhan farming and then decided to sell his own harvest. Ibragim also has an additional income from another type of business. He has several heads of livestock that he fattens up for subsequent sale. Now Ibragim wants to expand his business, specifically the farming on, but he currently does not have enough of his own savings to buy seeds for sowing. This is why Ibragim came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy seeds for sowing. Ibragim hopes very much for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the support in advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1671529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

is a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is 42 years old and she is married to Edwin. God has blessed them with four loving children. Life indeed is hard. But by the grace of God, they were able to raise their children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nCrisanta owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. Here you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg, etc.  She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerbys and the people in the community. She earns Php300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting an Php 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nCrisanta hopes that her business will thrive more and that she will be able to send her children to college.

world!  Meet Nancy, a 35-year-old, very energetic, hardworking and ambitious small scale farmer.  She hails from Kiamutugu village in the rural town of Kerugoya, a very fertile place that has wonderful weather patterns that support farming. She is happily married and has been blessed with 2 lovely children. \r\n\r\nNancy passionately loves farming and has been doing it for the past 7 years and has never looked back.  The animals on her farm have been given names of \u201cwangechi\u201d which is from a person\u2019s name, and taking care of them makes her very proud. Crop farming is close to Nancy\u2019s heart but she faces financial challenges buying farm implements.  \r\n\r\nThat is why she is requesting a loan. Through the loan she will be able to buy good quality seedlings and fertilizer that will boast her crop production.\r\n\r\nNancy always says, \u201cTo be a successful farmer all you need is good quality seed, fertilizer and advice from successful farmers\u201d. Improved crop production will immediately result to more profits and hence improved living conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how this loan will benefit her your family, Nancy replied \"I will be able to educate my children and feed my family.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1671457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Lions Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsitsi is the chairlady of Hungry Lions Group. The group is based in Dzivarasekwa 3, a township in Harare. Tsitsi is a tailor by profession.  She is a widow with three school going children. Tsitsi started her trade working for other tailors until she saved up some money to buy her own sewing machines. Her progress was slow until she heard about Thrive and came to business training and was advanced a loan together with her group members.\n\nWith her first and 2nd loan from Thrive, Tsitsi has managed to grow her business and she now sews uniforms and wedding attires. Tsitsi has also established a brand name for her business, being \u201cChibvaruranhamo Tailoring Shop\u201d, translated meaning Tearing Poverty Apart Shop.

He has worked doing this for 28 years. He learned this activity from his father who taught him when he was young. The distance to his place of work is close to his house. What is more difficult is how to bring the agricultural inputs, because he lives in an area which is pretty far from the closest municipality. One of his adult children helps him with this. His work schedule is of approximately 6 hours per day.  He is requesting the loan to CREDICAMPO to buy manure so he can fertilize the already sown corn, which is now growing and in need of fertilization. This loan will improve his business since his production will improve through timely fertilization. As mentioned earlier, Luis' dreams are to keep on advancing through work and to keep on cultivating the soil. This has allowed him to move his family forward. He wishes that his children will be able to move ahead through effort and perseverance and that he can help them. The loan is a tool to improve his business' productivity and improve his earnings.

All of Malika's children are grown and live separately, and only her youngest daughter, who is a student, lives with her and helps with the household. Malika has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for many years. Thanks to Malika's hard work, today her business has 2 cows with calves and 0.54 hectares of land, where she primarily grows clover to prepare livestock feed. She also daily sells ecologically clean and delicious milk that is in high demand among the local residents.  Malika's monthly profit amounts to about 20,000 som (KGS). Malika has already started to use her savings to build a house, but does not have enough money to complete it, and this is why she requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy cement, bricks and slate. Malika plans to invest the profit from her animal husbandry business into a future expansion of her business and building a house for her son.

This area is known to be a banana-growing region and experiences one of the best weather patterns. Their staple food is \u201cmatoke,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. She has been happily married and has been blessed with 7 lovely children. She passionately loves farming and has been actively involved in farming for the past 20 years. Through those years, she gained so much experience and is touted as the best farmer in her village, so she offers free advice to young upcoming farmers. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, tea and a variety of crops.\r\nYunuke enjoys dairy farming, milking, and feeding her cows.  The biggest challenge she faces is the lack of a quality exotic breed that can produce more milk and satisfy the milk demand that is in her area. To solve this problem, Yunuke is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo so that she can buy a good quality breed of dairy cow that can produce between 10-20 liters of milk in a day. She does not have to worry about the market because the demand is so high for that type of milk and she could also sell the milk to a large dairy processing company. Through this, she will get an immediate increase in profit margins and she will improve her living conditions.\r\nIn addition to profits in milk, she will also benefit from manure (cow dung) from the cow which will boost her farm fertility and production levels. Yunuke is very visionary and in the long run, she plans that through accumulated profits, she will be able to buy more exotic dairy cows and will be able to open a large dairy shop where she will package milk and sell milk products such as cream and yogurt.  Through increased profits, she will fully repay the loan and live a financially secure life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1671504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T01:40:06Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yunuke","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2610.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3112.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3162.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3276.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3336.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3426.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3577.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3614.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3725.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3812.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3922.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4021.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.91,"local_amount":6648.09,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6672.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547648},{"amount":34.9,"local_amount":3056.51,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3067.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680651},{"amount":38.84,"local_amount":3401.6,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3414.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624938},{"amount":39.47,"local_amount":3456.66,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3469.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194018},{"amount":80.06,"local_amount":7011.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7037.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261927},{"amount":84.79,"local_amount":7426,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7453.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600196},{"amount":115.17,"local_amount":10599.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10638.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.86,"payment_id":681377058}],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T18:57:57Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bethany Katerberg","image":604977}},{"id":754446,"name":"Mujeres Guapas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"19 mujeres integran el grupo Ku\u00f1a Guapa, donde todas y cada una de ellas est\u00e1n poniendo su mejor esfuerzo para poder ayudar a sus familias por medio del trabajo unido.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

This will enable her to  increase her sales revenue and offer better prices to her customers, so that in the near future she can have a higher income."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1672434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy general merchandise including clothing, shoes, cosmetics, and other items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolonia Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":753656,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is a 35-year-old woman.

The stove can use any type of solid biomass fuel, producing 70% less smoke and using 65% less fuel than traditional mud cook stoves.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1671533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a smokeless stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Ariyalur, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santhi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalaiyarasi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kosalam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjalai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valarmathi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vembu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumathi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pushpavalli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajeshwari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saroja ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selvarani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sutha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":19600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":19600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-22T14:28:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":754489,"name":"Willian Asael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Willian, ha tenido un resultado positivo al invertir el capital anterior en su negocio, pues tuvo los recursos econ\u00f3micos para reparar el cami\u00f3n y pintar el microb\u00fas para brindar un mejor servicio y seguridad a sus clientes y de esta manera seguir generando ingresos para cancelar los gastos familiares.

They have an average of three children and all live in traditional families in Adamabougou, one of the villages in Koutiala, the third largest administrative region in Mali. The women work with the micro-finance organization Soro Yiriwaso to better operate their agricultural businesses during the rainy season. They are on their ninth loan; the previous loans were all fully repaid. Awa Tiemoko, siting second from right to left in the photo, grows groundnuts.

Meet Brighton, a very young, hardworking small holder farmer who is 22 years of age. He is happily married to a beautiful wife, and they are blessed with one child. He hails from Kapsokwony village in the Bungoma area of Kenya.

Through farming, he has been able to take care of his young family.\r\n\r\nHis main source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming, and through these ventures, he has supported his young family because he is the only breadwinner. Brighton passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of his animals \u201cBrown,\u201d which is an English word depicting the color of the cow. Brighton stated that the most enjoyable bit about farming is \u201cit gives me personal fulfillment and feeds my family.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. He has been facing challenges transporting his produce from the farm to the market; that is why he is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. The Bungoma area is a rural town and roads are very poor, and transporting goods for Brighton has always been a \u201cnightmare.\u201d He has been suffering losses because goods reach the market when they are not fresh, hence fetching a low price. \r\n\r\nVegetables and milk are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and through the loan, he will be able to achieve his dream. Brighton plans to employ someone who will be helping him in farm work and transporting the produce to the market, hence impacting the society positively through creation of employment. Increased profits from the loan will allow him to repay the loan fully and be able to permanently change his living conditions and assure his child of a secure future.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1671612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to transport his produce from the farm to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bungoma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.566667 34.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brighton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4079.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4863.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4941.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5119.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5213.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5590.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5648.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5821.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5957.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6128.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6282.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":111.39,"local_amount":9654.21,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":9791.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547649},{"amount":57.24,"local_amount":4960.87,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680652},{"amount":50.1,"local_amount":4342.04,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4403.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194019},{"amount":128.89,"local_amount":11170.17,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":11329.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823430},{"amount":56.37,"local_amount":4885.6,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4955.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264050},{"amount":59.94,"local_amount":5223.06,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5297.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"payment_id":665458799},{"amount":66.18,"local_amount":6026.54,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6112.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.36,"payment_id":681377059},{"amount":92.71,"local_amount":8500.95,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8621.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.38,"payment_id":696586902},{"amount":110.63,"local_amount":10236.56,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10382.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.48,"payment_id":731024376}],"funded_date":"2014-09-19T09:03:05Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":753764,"name":"Kevin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kevin is a married man.

Without his location, small businesses would have to travel to the city and waste time and money on transportation. \r\n\r\nNow, John is requesting a Kiva loan so that he can increase his line of products. Currently, he only stocks Coca-Cola and Fanta in glass bottles, on a very small scale. This loan will help him to add Sprite and increase the volume of his product line. This increase in volume will help John turnover more sales and earn additional income.  \r\n\r\nJohn has high hopes for the future.

grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1671639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

The above picture presents Evans, an ever-smiling 25-year-old young, hardworking and honest man. He is happily married and is blessed with one beautiful child, age 5 months. Being still young and full of energy, he has been practicing farming for the past five years, and has been making profits. His farming involves feeding and attending to his animals. His primary source of income is selling eggs, maize, vegetables and some small business he does to make ends meet. When asked what\u2019s the most enjoyable bit about farming he answered, \u201cI get food to eat and to sell\u201d.\r\n\r\nEvans has an expansive land, and has planted enough Napier grass. He has always wanted to buy a good dairy breed of cow, but the challenge he has been facing is a lack of finances.  That is why he is seeking funds to make his dream a reality.\r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, he will make his dream a reality because these institutions are all about helping small-scale farmers better their livelihood. He underwent training with Juhudi Kilimo, and has learned that microfinances help the poor access financing and help them in their projects.\r\n\r\nHe says that through the loan, he will increase his milk production and therefore increase his income levels. Profits from the loan will be used in repaying back the loan and securing the future of his young

This is because, at the time that he went to school, the schools were too far from his house.  He had to walk too far to get to one.  Also, he had to help his parents with work.  Therefore, his father decided to stop sending him to school and to have Jos\u00e9 work with him.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is married, and his wife devotes herself to the household chores.

At times he has to travel to other departments to work, and he has to travel many hours by bus.  He says that he works eight hours a day, and when he needs to finish jobs more quickly, he works extra hours.\r\n\r\nHe has also been growing coffee for seven years.  He engages in this business activity due to a coffee growing project that emerged in the area where he lives.  He has done this since then because he gets good income thanks to the coffee.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from CrediCampo is to buy trowels, tape, shovels, handcarts, and string, etc.  He needs these because he has used the ones he has for some many years that they have worn out.  This way he will be able to be more efficient in his work, and he will be able to give his family a better life.  He will also plant coffee plants on a piece of land that he has.\r\n\r\nIn the future Jos\u00e9 plans to be able to export his coffee harvest in order to get good and improved earnings when he sells it.
