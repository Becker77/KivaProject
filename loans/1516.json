She was one of the first Yellow Leaf artisans and is one of the most talented and prolific weavers. Because of her generosity of spirit and the way she bolsters the entire community, she has grown to be a leader among the village weavers. She is rich in friends and respected by her peers. \n\nYalana was born in the jungles of rural northern Thailand at the end of an era for her tribe, the Mlabri. Her father was a respected sorcerer and very knowledgeable about traditional Mlabri life. But when she was young, life rapidly changed as deforestation destroyed the jungles where they had lived for generations. Without any land rights or capital to farm, Yalana eventually became an indentured servant, along with her parents and the rest of the tribe. They worked clearing land in the fields of the more powerful tribes in the region. The back-breaking slash and burn was dangerous and the payment was meager, but there were no alternatives available. \n\nHammock weaving presented Yalana's first opportunity to build a new life and she greeted this excellent opportunity with ambition and diligence! Today she lives in the Ban Bunyuen Village and helps provide for her family by applying her traditional artisan talents toward weaving hammocks that are sold around the world. \n\nShe has acquired enough independence to be able to plant rice fields for her family, generally harvesting enough grain to last from one harvest to the next. Hunting and foraging continue to play a role in her family\u2019s daily sustenance, but they are no longer limited to what they can hunt or catch; her income from making hammocks affords them healthcare, education, and food security formerly unavailable to them.\n\nWith the hunter and gatherer lifestyle lost to the past,  Yalana has adjusted to her new situation while maintaining her pride and confidence as a Mlabri woman.\n\nThis is Yalana's second Kiva loan through the field partner program. As a member of the inaugural class of Kiva weavers, she went through a financial literacy program, improved her budgeting skills and opened her first bank account!\n\nJust a few years ago, this level of stability was out of reach for Yalana. For a woman born in her circumstances, the opportunity to earn a solid wage and be offered reliable credit is truly remarkable. With this Kiva loan, Yalana will continue to build a strong foundation for her family's future and will begin saving money in her new bank account!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1676638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to increase her production capacity by investing in raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Refugee"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yalana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T19:47:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":754036,"name":"Tee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tee is a 40-year-old, divorced woman with two children.

Although she has seen the difficult side of life up close, she continues to keep her spirits high and to believe in a brighter future.\n\nAnong is a mother, wife and member of the close-knit Mlabri tribe in rural northern Thailand. Although she now lives in the Ban Boonyuen Village with many of her fellow Mlabri, she spent years without stability. Like many of her fellow Mlabri, Anong was forced into indentured servitude as a field laborer working in slash & burn agriculture. She and her family worked in back-breaking toxic farming in order to pay off a never-ending cycle of debt to stronger clans.\n\nFor Anong and the rest of the Mlabri, the past decades have been full of heartbreak, tragedy and incredible perseverance. The gentle Mlabri once lived a peaceful lifestyle as migrant hunter & gatherers, but the teak deforestation and guerrilla warfare of the late 20th century destroyed their lifestyle forever. Impoverished, enslaved and malnourished, the tribe lost most of its members to malaria and other illnesses- with just 300 members left in the world, the Mlabri are listed on UNESCO\u2019s \u201cendangered languages\u201d list. \n\nHammock weaving is the first proven path for Anong and her fellow Mlabri artisans to break free of the cycle of debt and servitude. Although she is a skilled artisan weaver, she used to be compelled to return to fieldwork when there were not enough hammock orders. Raising three children while moving from place to place in the slash & burn fields was daunting and discouraging.\n\nThis is Anong's second Kiva loan through the field partner program. As a member of the inaugural class of Kiva weavers, she went through a financial literacy program, improved her budgeting skills and opened her first bank account!\n\nAnong is finally breathing easily and allowing herself to believe that her children will have a chance to grow up without the same fear and hardship she faced. She is very grateful to the Kiva community for supporting the stability she spent her life hoping for."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1676613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to help expand production and ensure that her family can work + learn during the slow season.

Before him, his father had known the hardships \u2013 and the independence\u2013 of a life lived mainly in the jungles. Rampant deforestation and extensive agriculture reduced forested land to a fraction of its past area. By the time Daeng was born in 1983, the Mlabri people had been reduced to indentured servitude in the slash & burn fields of other ethnic groups in Thailand.\n\nDaeng grew up in the Ban Bunyuen Village and learned to read and write at the school there. Basic education opened up many new avenues of knowledge for him, while village elders and his older relatives introduced him to the ways of the jungle. Daeng thus straddles both generations; he is an example to the younger ones, and a help in guiding the older ones through the intricacies of modern life.\n\nDaeng does not have the same fear of the outside world as the older generation does. He can hold his own in a pinch and he knows where to go for help when he\u2019s hard pressed.\n\nLike many of his fellow weavers, Daeng weaves hammocks to provide a better life for his wife and their children- he\u2019s a great dad! He is savvy enough to make wise decisions in his purchases, yet retains a uniquely Mlabri penchant for helping others \u2013 something that weaving hammocks allows him to do. \n\nDaeng was one of the first to tell about Mlabri life in his lead role in the documentary film, The Importance of Being Mlabri. He still functions as a liaison with outsiders, running interference for those with fewer skills in those areas.\n\nThis is Daeng's second Kiva loan through the field partner program. As a member of the inaugural class of Kiva weavers, he went through a financial literacy program, improved his budgeting skills and opened his first bank account!\n\nDaeng's last Kiva loan helped him save up for a new motorcycle, which gives his family more independence and mobility.

home, Chanai and her family were forced into bondage as field laborers in back-breaking toxic agriculture. Exploited, impoverished and malnourished, only 300 Mlabri survived this dark era. \n\nToday, hammocks are empowering Chanai and her family to build a brighter future. Weaving work is safe, highly paid and community-focused. Chanai is overjoyed that her children are able to attend school instead of toiling in the fields. \n\nAs one of the most outgoing weavers, she keeps the old Mlabri traditions alive with her love of storytelling. Chanai loves the freedom that she has to work at her own pace as a weaver- it suits her relaxed, fun-loving nature. \n\nChanai is also a traditional Mlabri in the sense that she puts the community first. For example, she has had several extended family members move in with her during the past year. In many cultures, this would be an unwelcome strain on finances- but Chanai sees this as an opportunity to teach her family how to weave and share more work with everyone. \n\nShe is excited to use this Kiva loan to help expand production and ensure that her family can work and learn during the slow season. They will build momentum and stockpile hammocks for a busy spring!\n\nAs a member of the newest class of Kiva weavers, Chanai also has support creating a family budget, is part of an ongoing financial literacy program and will receive assistance opening up her first bank account!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1676628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to increase her production capacity to secure consistent weaving work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T17:20:07Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chanai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-22T02:07:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":754031,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a buy and sell ready to wear business in the Philippines.

She married Daeng, a Mlabri young man who also believes in carrying on the tribe's traditions. They work as a team, each weaving hammocks and caring for the children.

Her mother, just one generation ahead of her, lived as a hunter-gatherer in the secluded jungles of nothern Thailand. The Mlabri Tribe's existence was changed forever by rampant deforestation, guerrilla warfare and the unstoppable encroachment of the modern world. By the time Jeab was a girl, the traditional lifestyle of the Mlabri had vanished. Without education, land or opportunity, her family was forced to work in back-breaking slash and burn agriculture as indentured servants for neighboring tribes. \n\nFrom a young age, Jeab battled to create new opportunities for herself. Despite her family's difficult circumstances, she persevered in attending school as often as she could. She holds the distinction of being the very first Mlabri person to reach the 6th grade in school! She has continued to take non-formal education classes even after marrying and becoming a mother herself. \n\nWhile Jeab has not lived the same life her mother did, she still feels rooted to her community and tribe. With her language and reading skills, she would probably be able to find work in a distant city. But with only a small group of Mlabri left in the world, she feels a commitment to making sure her children grow up near family and she is proud to be able to support her mother, who lives with her. \n\nHammock weaving has created an opportunity for Jeab to hold a skilled job and earn a healthy wage within her village. With her reading ability and smarts, she often helps other weavers learn new designs. For Jeab, the ability to live a stable life and be regarded as a teacher is truly remarkable. With her Kiva loan, she will be able to plan her weaving for the coming year and balance her time between work and home responsibilities. \n\nAs a member of the newest class of Kiva weavers, Jeab also has support creating a family budget, is part of an ongoing financial literacy program and will receive assistance opening up her first bank account!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1676633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to increase production capacity and secure consistent weaving work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T17:20:08Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T23:58:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":754045,"name":"Faasuamalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faasuamalie is 31 years old and divorced with two children.

live in polygamous families in Bobola, one of the villages in N'kouraba, the second largest region in Mali. They are working with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance association in order to successfully drive their agricultural activities during the rainy season. They are on their third loan with the organisation. They grow peanuts and millet via Fanta, the first person standing up on the left in the photo. With her loan, she aims to purchase fertiliser, seeds and to pay the labour costs for cultivating 1 hectare of land.

Currently he   farms two hectares of land which is located three km from his home, on the slopes of a volcano. He has to rent the land; this is how he earns money to support his family.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Gerber is seeking from CrediCampo is to buy maize seeds as well as such items as manure, fertilizer, herbicide etc. He already has some of the money he needs but lacks funds to complete his budget. Gerber also needs some money to lease the land he farms.\r\n\r\nHis greatest wish is to build a brick house as the one he has at the moment is partly made of coconut palms and partly brick. After the harvest he will be able to pay off his loan and start building the house. He knows that he will succeed with the help of the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1672611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Buy maize seeds, agricultural supplies, and pay the rent on his land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerber Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611770162}],"funded_date":"2014-09-20T17:03:48Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":756478,"name":"Djekafo  I Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les  10 membres du groupe  DJEKAFO I  sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 35 ans, 4 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles polygames \u00e0 GAMA, un des villages de N\u2019KOURABA, 2\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat de campagne avec l\u2019institution.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est  l\u2019arachide, le mil et le gombo avec  NIA, 2\u00e8me personne debout  de la gauche vers la droite  sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter des intrants, des semences et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir  2 hectares. \nLa production est vendue au niveau du village, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e de revendeurs et de consommateurs. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de  195.000FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.\n","en":"The ten members of the group DJEKAFO I are married women who average 35 years of age and 4 children each.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAna Cleta dreams of putting up her own service center and having a bigger customer connection. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1517260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional supplies and merchandise like clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cleta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.36,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T11:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4101.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530000431},{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4101.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542491954},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5126.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625143},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2050.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535290}],"funded_date":"2014-08-21T20:52:13Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Nicaise","image":1379391}},{"id":754064,"name":"Maridel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maridel has been working with her husband on their own farm for many years to make a living.

Ever since he was young his father taught him how to work the land. He had the opportunity to go to school but only for a few years. Every morning he used to leave the house with his father to help him grow maize, beans, and jicama. For the last five years  Rafael has been growing his own jicama on two hectares of land which he rents. His fields are 3km from his home which doesn't cause him a problem. He also has one hectare where he grows maize on land that a relative rents to him.\r\n\r\nThe loan money will be used to buy seeds. Last year he didn't manage to buy seeds. A neighbour will sell him the seeds he needs for two hectares of jicamas. The rest of the loan money will be used to buy agricultural supplies so he can look after the plants before selling the produce.\r\n\r\nRafael's big dream is to use the money from the harvest of the jicamas to pay for his children's education. Then they will have better opportunities to get get good jobs.

for almost a year now.  She is 41 years of age and blessed with four children. Her husband, Neri, helps her in their business and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMarcia wants to make her business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. For this reason, she would like a loan amounting to 10,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. \r\n\r\nMarcia hopes that as she expands her business, there will also a significant increase in her profit. She dreams for her children to complete their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1672029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Josefina would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. With an amount of 20,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely wants you to know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Josefina hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams to give her children a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Bahman has impressed licensed medical doctors with his knowledge of anatomy and his ability to apply that knowledge to pain cases that conventional medicine has difficulty treating.\r\n\r\nBahman currently holds a license as a Holistic Health Practitioner and is working on his dissertation for a Ph.D. in Holistic Medicine. He has chosen to specialize in sport medicine and pain management, and is able to treat cases of frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel, plantar fasciitis and range-of-motion issues using holistic methods rather than the approach called for in conventional medicine: invasive surgery.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Germany, he began his career working at German engineering giant Siemens before tiring of corporate life and moving to the US twelve years ago. He eventually got into holistic health, and also works as a yoga instructor and conducts wellness seminars with doctors and other colleagues in the medical field.\r\n\r\nBahman will use his Kiva loan to purchase equipment, such as a UV lamp, precursor and a cold laser, that will help him better treat his patients. With the help of Kiva lenders, Bahman hopes to continue to help relieve his patients\u2019 pain without the need for surgery, and thus help people lead richer, more rewarding lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1671797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to

Gissar district. Khaticha lives there with her family. Khaticha is a very kind, cute and happy young woman. She recently learned how to sew and now wants to provide seamstress services. Khaticha learned to sew women's clothing, drapes and national cotton blankets. Khaticha learned to sew with a help of an old sewing machine. Now she thinks that she has become a good specialist to independently accept sewing orders and start a new business, which would make her a financially independent woman. But Khaticha understands that she cannot advance with such an old sewing machine and intends to buy a new, modern sewing machine. However, since she is just starting her business, she does not have enough money and is asking for help.

","en":"Gulnora divorced her husband several years ago. She returned to her parents' house after the divorce. At the present time, she lives with her brothers. Gulnora had to start her own business to support herself. She leased a space and opened a cafe. Gulnora cooks national dishes and sells them to local residents.

village customers, including 6 CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. In this village, people are friendly and hospitable to everyone although they are struggling with their daily life. They are always enthusiastic to improve their living standards by finding ways to figure out business problems.  That said, this village is located in Myanmar's dry zone, where insufficient rainfall is very common. Most villagers are Buddhist and struggle finding access to affordable credit, as the state-owned agricultural bank is not active in the area.\r\n\r\nThe new loan will help this village purchase a tractor that will help with the planting and harvesting of crops such as sesame and beans. Nowadays, villagers are struggling to pay to lease a tractor from a neighboring village. It costs each farmer about $10 per day, not including the diesel fees that they must pay to operate the tractor. One gallon of diesel is $5. During harvest, villagers have to pay even more than $10 per day because of the spike in demand.  In addition to farming, villagers cultivate Thanatkhar trees, which is used as a traditional beauty product by Burmese women, and raise livestock.  They also have a long-term plan to cultivate limonia trees for timber and sap. \r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the village CBO: U Win, U Aung, U Kyaw, U Sein , U Kyi, and U Yin. Included in the photo (third from the right) is U Sein, the father of two children. As there is only a primary school in the village, his children have to go to secondary school in a nearby village. He needs additional capital to purchase farming inputs so that his crop income can support his children's education expenses.\r\n

This village is located in Myanmar's dry zone, where insufficient rainfall is very common. Most villagers are Buddhist and struggle finding access to affordable credit, as the state-owned agricultural bank is not active in the area.  Additionally, labor to help farmers during the intense planting and harvesting seasons is limited, as most of the village's young people are migrating to other cities in search of economic opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe previous loan was used by the villagers to purchase seeds such as sesame, various beans, and rice paddies. ThIs new loan will help farmers buy livestock, namely cows, pigs and goats.  These animals can help on the farm, as their manures can be used as a natural fertilizer, and their offspring can be sold for additional income.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the village CBO: U Khin, U Tin, U Than, U Min, and Daw Hnin. Included in the photo (second from right) is U Khin, who is 42 years old and the father of one child, who is in secondary school.  He purchased paddy, bean, and sesame seeds with his past loan. He is now saving money to purchase two bulls, which are more expensive than other animals. His new loan, on top of his accrued savings, will make it possible for him to buy the bulls."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5800,"image":{"id":1667881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Pakokku","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2014-08-21T22:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-20T22:00:08Z","loan_amount":5800,"lender_count":210,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wan Be Chaing Village","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":5600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5800,"local_amount":5600000,"processed_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5614400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752382}],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T14:49:42Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:57:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":754118,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence works hard to support her family.

children.  All of his children are grown and have their own families, and Uzokbek lives with his wife in a small house in a village.  Despite his age, he is a very strong and wants to work for the good of his family.  He works in a deanery and he also raises livestock.\r\n\r\nHe has a plot of land, which is roughly 12 hectares.  Of the entire plot, 8 hectares are for dry farming and the rest is irrigated.  Uzokbek grows carrots, potatoes and wheat on his land, and his wife helps him raise and take care of the livestock.

Most of his work involves corporate events, weddings, parties and other special occasions.  Now he needs a new musical instrument called a \"gonga.\"  It's a percussion instrument which is used to create more complicated rhythms with the help of drumsticks and a snare drum.  When the \"gonga\" is struck, a small rattle produces an interesting howling sound with either an increased or decreased tone.  But Juraboi doesn't have enough money to buy this instrument, which is why he is asking for a loan from Arvand and he is counting on their

They have five children, ages 20, 18, 14, 8, and 2. Only three of them are in school. The others help their father in agriculture.\r\n\r\nAna began to work with her parents planting corn and beans at the age of 12. Then she found work selling fruits and vegetables, where she worked for 7 years. Five years ago she decided to begin her own business selling tortillas and pupusas; it is located in the city market. Every day she travels approximately 10 km by bus from her house to her business. She begins her work at 7 in the morning and works until 3 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is applying for at CrediCampo is to buy corn, fresh cheese, pork rinds, beans, and oil to make the tortillas and the pupusas and to buy fruits and vegetables that she also wants to sell at her sales stand.\r\n\r\nAna has a dream of improving her house and also helping her three children to continue studying and having her other two children find worthy jobs.

hard-working man.  He is 46 years old and he is married with three children.  He first turned to Arvand when he found out that he had a chance to receive financial support.  Bahodur lives with his family in a village and he doesn't have a higher education, as he never got a chance to go to university because of his family's financial struggles.  His wife is also not educated and she is a housewife, doing work from home and looking after the children.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn a living, Bahodur has his own business raising and selling cattle.  He also works in construction and he earns a good living from these endeavors.  His wife also helps him, as she sells milk from their cows.  Now Bahodur is preparing to marry off his eldest son.  He is making plans for the wedding, but he needs to buy many things for the dowry and he doesn't have enough money in his savings.  This is why he has turned to Arvand to ask for a loan to buy a dowry for his son's wedding.  Bahodur is hoping for a good result and he thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1672245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

Meet Christine, who is a 36-year-old, hardworking mother and farmer who is easy to get along with. She hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to the world\u2019s best long distance runners, many of whom have won gold medals in international marathons. She is happily married and blessed with 3 lovely children. She passionately loves dairy farming and has been practising it for the past 5 years. She has never regretted starting to farm. Her primary source of income is milk, eggs, and crop farming. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family and she has always yearned to have more dairy cows. Accordingly, she is seeking a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She has already identified the breed of cow that she will buy. The cow will be producing between 15-20 litres of milk per day. This breed of cow will be producing milk referred to as \u201cthe ideal drinking milk\u201d, because it will not lack an adequate amount of fat and will possess desirable quantities of protein. This cow will certainly boost milk production in her farm, which will translate to more sales volume and better income for her and her family. Because of this high milk production potential, she will save more money to fully repay the loan. She believes that through careful selection and the application of the strict standard of excellence in keeping her dairy cow, she will have more income, which will improve her living standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1672170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-22T02:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-21T02:50:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2011.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2398.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2436.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2524.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2570.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2639.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2756.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2785.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2870.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3021.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3097.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.07,"local_amount":6244.73,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6429.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547652},{"amount":39.11,"local_amount":3343.02,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3442.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680655},{"amount":16.27,"local_amount":1390.4,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261930},{"amount":21.98,"local_amount":1878.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1934.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264053},{"amount":44.15,"local_amount":3773.25,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3885.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600199},{"amount":31.21,"local_amount":2678.38,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2757.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.13,"payment_id":665458802},{"amount":73.09,"local_amount":6557.07,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6751.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.63,"payment_id":681377062},{"amount":66.47,"local_amount":6184.81,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6368.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.89,"payment_id":711505132}],"funded_date":"2014-08-22T04:31:30Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Yan","image":1083582}},{"id":754219,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is a married woman.

He is living with his family in their own house in the capital city of Sana'a, Yemen. He has a university education and now, he is an employee with a modest salary in the private sector. Sami is a very talented and respected man. He is also very active and dynamic and knows how he can run his life well. He strives hard to achieve a better future for his family. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sami's salary is not enough to cover all the expenses of his family. In order to cover all those expenses, he decided to increase his income through purchasing a taxi to work as a driver to transport people from one place to another inside the capital city to earn money as another income source for his family, and to use it as transportation for himself. \r\n\r\nSami thinks this business will be very profitable for himself. He could accumulate an amount of money from his salary to purchase a taxi. Unfortunately; that amount of money is not enough. For this reason, Sami is requesting a loan of 1,330,000 YER (Yemen rials) from AMB. He will use the loan to purchase a taxi to work as a driver to earn money that will help him improve the living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nSami looks forward to purchasing another taxi besides the first one to rent it out. His dream in the future is opening an automobile

He is based in Soy Village in Eldoret, an area that is referred to as \u201cthe city of champions\u201c because it's home to the best marathon runners that the world has ever produced. He is still single and has been doing mixed farming for the past two years. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming. He passionately loves dairy farming because of the constant income that he gets and has even nicknamed one of his cows \"Karait\u201d. Dairy farming is a very profitable business venture in Soy Village and has seen an upsurge in growth but the demand has been so high that the supply of milk cannot be met. Emmanuel is seeking a loan to buy an additional good breed of dairy cow. Having understood the market requirements, he wants to take full advantage of the ready demand that is there. The dairy cow he wants to buy is a quality breed that can produce 10-20 liters of milk a day and this will boost his production level significantly. Increased milk production will translate to more profits; hence improving his living conditions. The breed of cow he will buy has so many advantages.

The eldest daughter will help the family in running the shop.\r\n\r\nThe group was formed by women of common interest who want to get a loan to elevate their economic conditions.

She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and also she will purchase additional items for her direct selling business.

5 village customers. This village is located in Myanmar's dry zone, where insufficient rainfall is very common. Most villagers are Buddhist and struggle finding access to affordable credit, as the state-owned agricultural bank is not active in the area. Additionally, the village has difficulty accessing fresh water because the land is covered with salt, which contaminates the water.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will enable the village to hire labor and pay for topsoil and the expenses of operating farming machinery. The daily cost of a laborer is $3, and day laborers are scarce because most of the young people in the village are migrating to other cities in search of economic opportunities. To supplement their incomes from harvesting crops such as sesame and beans, villagers will sell palm sugar, incense, and livestock.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the borrowers from the village: U Thein, U Tun, U Nyein, U Win, and U Kan. Included in the photo is U Kan (farthest to the right), who is 72-years-old and the father of five children. His main business is farming. His children have already graduated and now manage their own businesses. He used his previous loan to buy topsoil and hire labor to help with planting and harvesting. With his new loan, he will pay to rent a tractor and buy diesel for the machine that removes the leaves from his sesame plants, which are stored and fed to his cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1667861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to hire laborers for the planting and harvesting seasons and pay for farm machinery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Pakokku","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2014-08-22T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-21T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kyauk Hle Bee Village","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":850000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":850000,"processed_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":852411.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752383}],"funded_date":"2014-08-22T20:38:47Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:57:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C Pettersen"}},{"id":754314,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Shoes","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy dozens of shoes to add to his current stock.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2014-08-22T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-21T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-11T20:21:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":754315,"name":"Ghada And Omar Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hiyam is the featured borrower of the Ghada and Omar group.

One small goat costs $80 to purchase and can be sold for $150, a $70 profit, after nine or ten months. Raising livestock is also very helpful to farmers because animal manure is used as fertilizer to improve soil conditions, meaning that they do not have to pay for expensive chemical fertilizers. Additionally, many villagers will cultivate toddy palm trees to sell palm sugar, and many women will set up small grocery stores in their homes to generate supplementary income.\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the village CBO: U Chan, Daw Mi, Daw Nyunt, Daw Mar, U Phoe, and U Sann.

Being very pleased with the help from his first Kiva deal, he is now impatient for his second one. Henzel is 59 years old and lives alone (unfortunately his wife died 2 years ago). Their only daughter is married and she lives with her family. She tries to visit her father as often as it is possible since Henzel still has not gotten used to the lonely life after the loss of his beloved wife. Henzel works a lot, all day long. He is the head of a rural village community and he himself has his own farm and a plot of land. On his farm he has cows, piglets and chickens. On his plot of land he cultivates vegetables and greens.

Meet Judith, a single mother who is 36 years of age, very hardworking and a dedicated farmer. She is a mother of one, and she is based in Kona Mbaya, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. This area is referred to as the breadbasket of Kenya because half the food Kenya consumes is from that region. \r\n\r\nJudith has spent the last six years of her life farming. She sells milk, maize and vegetables produced on her farm. She also offers transportation services to other farmers in Kona Mbaya village using her motorbike. Being a single mother, she has single-handedly provided for her child by engaging in seasonal business to make extra money. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is close to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient values. She is very close with her cows and has made a point in naming one of them Jessy. This is short form for Jersey, which is a very exotic breed of cow that produces high quality of milk. Judith has an expansive land and has planted so many trees which beautify the environment. She also has Napier grass that makes feeding easy for her dairy animals. \r\n\r\nAlthough this ever-smiling mother has been making profits through selling milk, she lacks funds to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow and also to build a dairy unit. The excess space in her farm will be utilized properly once she acquires the dairy cow. The exotic dairy cow will produce between 15 and 20 litres of milk, and this will translate into more profits and income. Profits from milk selling will allow Judith to expand her business and start packaging milk and processing other milk products such as cream, yoghurt and cheese. In addition to milk, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow, and she projects that she will be able to start a bio-gas plant in her farm which will save her money in fuel costs. With your loan, all that Judith dreams of is a secure future for her child.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":544.28,"image":{"id":1672378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Bela requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for building a greenhouse, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. Bela requested a loan from Credo to build a greenhouse and increase her family's income. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides start-up credit soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products.

She lives with her husband, who is extensively engaged in cultivating a plot of family-owned agricultural land, where maize and nuts are grown. The family earns income only from selling these farm products at the local market. They can't cover all daily costs with this income and need some investment capital to start any other activity. \r\n\r\nLiana has requested a loan several times, but without any success. At last, her application was approved through the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up program gives rural poor people a chance to start their own businesses. With the requested money, Liana plans to start a local trading business with books. She will purchase the products at wholesale prices and will sell door-to-door at increased prices. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the future, she will be capable of expanding her business to cover almost all of her customers' needs. Liana will be very grateful for the help and will highly appreciate it.

village customers, including six Community Based Organization (CBO) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. In this village, farmers will cultivate seven acres on average. Most villagers are Buddhists and will save money to celebrate cultural ceremonies and offer provisions to monks. Although there are three wells to supply water to the village, two of the wells have broken engines, so only one is working well enough to consistently supply fresh water.\r\n\r\nA new loan would enable this community to pay for labor fees. Due to the lack of job opportunities in the village, many young people are migrating to other cities. As a result, there are not many people who are able to work on the farms, and the cost of labor has increased to $4 for one day. Those who own many acres need to hire labor to weed at least twice per season. To supplement crop income, villagers will raise livestock such as goats, work on government-sponsored road construction projects, and collect green gram from neighboring cities.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Leik Kan Village CBO: U Soe, Daw Shwe, Daw Mar, U Kyaw, U Phel, and Daw Than. Included in the photo (third from the right) is U Soe, who is 38-years-old and the father of two small children. The new loan would help him to pay for laborers to weed his farm to protect his crops. He expects to spend about $150 in labor fees this farming season.

remote village of Kona Mbaya, Kitale. He has been practicing agribusiness for the past nine years and has never looked back. For a living, Solomon sells milk and food products from his farm into the local market. He makes extra money with a business running the only diesel posho mill in his village since there is no electricity connection. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied.\r\n\r\nAlthough Solomon has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. Solomon is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kitale and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Solomon does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. With this loan, Solomon is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Solomon will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm. Through this loan, he will assure his large family of a secure future and improved living

One day she dreams of being able to stand on her own two feet and eventually pass on her business to her four children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6925,"image":{"id":1672414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase additional bags of cassava flour to make into fou-fou","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2014-08-22T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-21T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":6925,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ra\u00efssa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Placide Omer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorelle ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ferlo Maxime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Savani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabelle ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marien ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roslie Sauvel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":3400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":194700},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":197100},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":199100},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":201600},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":203900},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":206200},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":211000},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":213500},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":215800},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":218500},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":221000},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":223600},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":226100},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":228800},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":230600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":405.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":419.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":424.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":429.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":434.85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":439.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":445.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":455.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":460.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":466.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":469.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":798.01,"local_amount":391800,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T13:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":391855.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530043274},{"amount":2076.08,"local_amount":1019300,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:53:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1019445.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542536095},{"amount":1749.17,"local_amount":858800,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":858922.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561669198},{"amount":1832.06,"local_amount":899500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":899628.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579588880},{"amount":455.66,"local_amount":230600,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":230632.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.02,"payment_id":595182860}],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T02:44:25Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:17:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":754615,"name":"Makerita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Makerita is a 24 year old single woman with no children.
