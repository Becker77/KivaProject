Ade manages a small shop that sells mobile phones, mobile phone accessories, and mobile phone airtime credits. His spouse is a fulltime housewife, taking care of their children who are going to school. He began working with Ruma two months ago because he wanted to increase his income. Since then, he became more aware of how mobile technology can support his business. He is really excited to expand his business with Ruma. As the business runs, he hopes to get a Kiva loan as working capital loan in order to do more transactions on weekends, which is when people mostly buy mobile airtime.

Lutfi is a miner who lives in Serang, a small city located about two hours from Jakarta. Lutfi is married - his wife is a full-time mother taking care of the family and their little 2.5-year-old daughter. As a miner, Lutfi realized that he needs to find another source of income to support his family's needs. One day, he met one of Ruma's staff and was really interested to sell mobile airtime credits; he could see there's a market opportunity from his surrounding neighborhood who mostly have used mobile phones in their daily life. He joined Ruma 2.5 months ago and has started selling mobile airtime credits. As Lutfi's business continues, he needs a working capital loan from Kiva that will be useful to top-up more mobile airtime credits on the weekends - which is when people mostly buy mobile airtime. He hopes that he will be able to run the business sustainably as he is really excited and passionate in learning how to do business with support and assistance from Ruma."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1672727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to process more mobile airtime credits transaction on weekends.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cilegon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-08-22T21:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-21T21:30:07Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ms Lutfi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":754704,"name":"Jewander","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"To make a living, a young entrepreneur, Jewander, has been operating a general store for over four years.

They are on their ninth loan; the previous loans were fully repaid. Salimata, standing at the far left in the photo, grows rice, groundnuts, and corn. With her loan, she plans to buy inputs, seeds, and to pay for the labor costs of farming of three hectares of land. After the harvest, the output is sold in Kolondieba to a clientele of men and women.

Together they have formed a family and have two children.\r\n\r\nFive years ago Daniel was unemployed, so he and Lore decided to start their own business buying and selling junk and they made good income from the business. Soon after, Lore started another business: selling planters and plaster figurines. \u201cMy parents started to do this work, and ever since I was little I would go with them to sell their products. Now I am very happy because I have my own business.\" \r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Lore to buy clay planters, plaster figurines, and paint. At home, she always decorates everything very imaginatively. She says she always tries to use the best paint so things last longer and her customers keep coming back.

35 village customers, including 4 CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. In this village, about 90% of households own bulls that help on the farm with planting and harvesting. This village is located in Myanmar's dry zone, where insufficient rainfall is very common. Most villagers are Buddhist, so must invest in cultural ceremonies and provisions to monks.  They also struggle finding access to affordable credit, as the state-owned agricultural bank is not active in the area.\r\n\r\nThe new loan would help this community raise livestock, especially cows and pigs, which generate extra income.  Additionally, manure from the animals can be used as a natural fertilizer, thereby enriching plants without forcing farmers to spend money on expensive chemical fertilizers.  In addition to this farming and livestock raising, villagers generate income by tapping sugar from palm trees and working as road construction workers in other cities.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Nyaung Pin Thar Village CBO: U Win, U Than, U Kyi, and Daw San. Included in the photo (second from the left) is U Win, who is 41 years old.  His main businesses are farming, construction, and making teak furniture. He purchased fertilizer with his past loan and is saving money to purchase a bull, which will cost  about $600, with his next loan. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7050,"image":{"id":1670546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to help 35 villagers raise livestock that will help with planting and harvesting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Magway","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2014-08-22T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-21T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":7050,"lender_count":256,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyaung Pin Thar Village","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":6850000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6850000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7050,"local_amount":6850000,"processed_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6867997.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752386}],"funded_date":"2014-08-27T18:54:20Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:56:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":754768,"name":"Yoeng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yoeng is 63 years old, living with her husband and eight children in a rural village of the Prey Chhor district.

Interestingly, there is a community foundation to support education, health, and social welfare for villagers. The whole village is very active in celebrating Buddhist cultural ceremonies and regularly offer provisions to monks, both of which are significant household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe new loan will help this village pay for laborers who will help with weeding and harvesting crops. Their crops, such as sesame and groundnuts, have been cultivated since April for this season. Thus, harvest is coming very soon, when the need for laborers will be high. An average of 80 laborers are needed to harvest and weed one acre. These laborers each charge $5 a day. Given that most young people have migrated to the cities in search of economic opportunities, farmers have to hire laborers from nearby villages when there is a shortage locally.  The extra income from crop sales will be contributed to other village developments. For instance, they are planning to build a brick tank to store water to protect the village against summer wildfires.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Yone Taw Village CBO: U Kyaw, U Myint, U Soe, U Than, and U Myo.

He is married and has 2 children aged 23 and 7 years. He has 1 additional dependent who lives with him for schooling.\n\nIn 2008, Bernard established his pharmacy business. He began his business because he wanted to help with the smooth running of his home. His business is located on the outskirts of town and his main customers are people in the general community. Working 7 days a week and 15 hours a day, he earns about 800,000 SLL every month from this business.\n\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL.

India has one of the world\u2019s largest productions of paddy crops in the world. So, Ashpia and her husband are associated with paddy cultivation.\r\n\r\nAshpia\u2019s family comprises her husband, Rajaaul, and her two small sons. One of the children is in grade one, and the other is too young for school. In her childhood she did not have any opportunity for education because of her family's financial stringency. She is illiterate and can sign her name only. Her husband has an elementary education.\r\n\r\nAshpia and her husband work tirelessly on their farmland to grow paddy. They sell their crop locally. They cultivate high-quality paddy, and selling prices are comparatively cheaper, so their customers are increasing gradually. But, the current household income is not sufficient and with the daunting responsibilities that they will face in the future to finance their children's education, it is imperative that she exploits the land for paddy cultivation.\r\n\r\nSo, in order to generate more income, they have planned to improve their business by cultivating more paddies. Ashpia is seeking a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) for her paddy cultivation. She will use the loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, etc. She expects to reap a good profit through her loan. With her finances in place, she can expect to bring stability to her family.\r\n\r\nShe wants to give thanks to her lenders (BJS and Kiva).\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1672364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers for cultivating paddy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-23T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-22T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashpia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T13:01:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":754805,"name":"Luwin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the year 2010, Luwin signed up his membership and has accessed loans from Paglaum MPC.

Additionally, the land of this village is made up of salty sand, which makes farming and getting access to fresh water difficult. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will help borrowers hire labor for the planting and harvesting seasons and purchase high quality farming inputs such as topsoil and fertilizer, which will boost crop yields. This boost in crop yields will lead to an increase in crop sales, and this additional income will be invested in a tractor, which will cost about $2,400.  As farmers cannot currently afford their own tractor, most of the farmers have to lease a machine for $12 a day, plus diesel fees.  Mechanization is especially important in this village, as many young people who would be hired as day laborers are migrated to urban centers in search of economic opportunities.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the village CBO: U Win, U Htay, U Thein, U Aung, U Shwe, and U Zaw.

Most villagers are Buddhist and struggle finding access to affordable credit, as the state-owned agricultural bank is not active in the area.\r\n\r\nThe new loan would help this community to buy a variety of seeds, as they grow various crops such as pigeon, sesame, and paddy. Villagers also need to purchase insecticides and pesticides to protect and enrich their crops. One bag of insecticide is about $15, and the required number of bags varies by acreage and crop farmed. In this village, people generate additional income by sewing and crafting handmade products, such as bamboo chairs. About 70% of households are able to sew clothes and make handmade accessories.  They are even planning to extend sales to nearby townships.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the village CBO: U Win, U Aye, U Shwe, U Myint, and Daw Cho.

Educationally, he only reached the sixth grade. He did not have the opportunity to continue studying, first due to the war that swept through his country and second because his family had to emigrate out of the country.\r\n\r\nHe is married, a father of two sons aged 10 and 14, who are studying in school. His wife does housework at home and raises their children.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is a mason with 15 years of experience. He builds homes, floors, walls etc. He remarks that he was out of the country in the United States for five years, working in the same line of work and he was able to expand his skills and boost his knowledge of masonry. This is why he envisions himself dedicating himself to this line of work. Nowadays, many people know of him and seek him out to give him work. He always complies and leaves his home. He learned this work by working alongside his uncle. Jos\u00e9 also works in agriculture with basic grains: corn, millet and beans.\r\n\r\nThe loan funds are for planting beans, priming the soil, and for paying the labor costs, since with his masonry projects he hardly has time for agriculture, so he has to find people to help with the work. He always has had the tradition of planting corn and beans to provide food daily for his family.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to be able to return to work in the United States; he says he has better wages for his family there, or else if he can't, then he hopes to find a better job here at home, improve his crops, obtain better yields and have his children go on to study in college; he also hopes to improve his home by building two more rooms for his two children: something that he will achieve with hard work and with future loans he will request.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1673384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"for planting beans, land preparation and payment of labor, because due to his work commitments, he almost has no available time and he has to find people to help with the work.

He is married and living with his wife and his two children. Ayatulloh runs a small stall that sells snacks, drinks, and mobile phone airtime credits. He began working with Ruma a month ago because he wanted to increase his income. He feels really excited to expand his business in selling mobile phone airtime credits and serving bill payments.

Dunuk was first introduced to Ruma (microfinance institution) by one of Ruma's staff who visited her small stall and she became excited to sell mobile airtime ever since. She can see that the opportunity of selling mobile airtime to her neighborhood is huge. Nowadays, as her business continues to grow, she hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva in order to process mobile airtime transactions on busy weekends. That way, Dunuk can increase her family's income. In the photo, Dunuk is standing in front of her small stall.

Dipti's husband cultivates potatoes and gourds (bottle gourds, bitter gourds and ribbed gourds) and sells the gathered harvest in the local markets. As the income is too scant to provide the basic needs of his family, he thought of cultivating a crop that is profitable and is an all-season crop. So they have decided to grow paddy on their farmland. Because they have inadequate capital, they have decided to take some financial help for cultivation.\r\n\r\nDipti has sought a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) and the requested loan is very important for Dipti to be able to purchase fertilizer and seeds for land cultivation.

Meet Bascillisa, a 41-year-old caring, honest and very hard-working mother of 4 children.  She is based in Kologolo a remote village in Kitale area of Kenya. She is a determined farmer who easily jells with other people and has been practicing farming for the past 25 years. All through those years she has never looked back and has never regretted any single bit. Her primary source of income has been eggs, milk and a variety of food crops she sells to the local market and to her neighbors. Through income from farming she has been able to earn a living and always put food on the table for her family. Bascillisa is a very hard working woman and rises very early to go to her farm since farming is the only way she can earn a decent living. When asked what she enjoys about farming her reply was \u201cI enjoy the returns I get after hard work\u201d.\r\n\r\nShe passionately loves poultry farming because the business is very profitable and can be done on a part time basis to make extra income. She is facing challenges of lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. Bascillisa wants to buy good quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to disease and have high productivity. Through the loan she will buy quality breeds of poultry that will increase her egg production and this will translate to increased income. Other than profits she will also benefit from chicken manure which will increase the fertility of her farm and save money that would have been used in buying fertilizer. Bascillisa is very determined to succeed and be economically empowered but, being a woman, she knows that accessing funds is very challenging. However,knowing that there are partners such as Kiva and Juhudi Kilimo, she feels relieved and knows that her dream will be achieved and she will provide a secure future for her school going

After working as a volunteer counselor with Childline Zimbabwe, as a token of appreciation, World Education funded her to start a project and she thought of chicken rearing. In 2013, when she was on the third batch, her birds were affected by Newcastle - a serious poultry disease. A friend in her group (also doing poultry business) advised her to take the birds to the Veterinary Department. She then got help on how to treat various diseases that affects chickens. The business bloomed and she managed to save money for buying a residential stand in Dzvivarasekwa, Harare.  With the Kiva loan, Clara will be able to build another fowl run to have more birds reared at her place. She also hopes the in future she will be able to keep chicken layers as well as broilers. \nClara and her friends formed the Silver and Gold group. Most of the members in the group keep poultry and they help each other to market their chicken as well as bringing them up. The group continually attends training offered at Thrive and this has since helped then to prepare budget in the business before spending the money. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1675098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To expand her poultry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2014-08-23T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-22T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evidence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shiela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":316.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":317,"local_amount":317,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":317,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542672357},{"amount":316.34,"local_amount":316.34,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":316.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561806066},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":316.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":316.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579778301},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":316.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":316.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595332027},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":316.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":316.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610722284},{"amount":316.65,"local_amount":316.65,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":316.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624406524}],"funded_date":"2014-08-27T18:54:24Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T13:56:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":756620,"name":"Girabagenzi Ii Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Aisha  fait partie du groupe  Girabagenzi  et  habite \u00e0  Bujumbura.

Por otro lado, su sue\u00f1o es tener un puesto fijo o un local en donde pueda vender los productos sin ning\u00fan problema aunque tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda mejorar su vivienda.  \nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Ma del Carmen y Araceli quienes invertir\u00e1n en figuras de yeso; Feliciana, en perfumes; Guadalupe y Jes\u00fas, en la elaboraci\u00f3n de tortillas; mientras que Lizeth y Rosalba lo har\u00e1n en ropa.\n*En la foto: Abigail se encuentra detr\u00e1s de do\u00f1a Jes\u00fas quien est\u00e1 vestida con un su\u00e9ter azul.\n","en":"This group chose its name since, for its members, having received a loan from VisionFund M\u00e9xico was like a miracle to invest in their businesses. The group members are very happy people who, above all, are very responsible.\r\n\r\nAbigail is 24 years old and has lived in a common-law-marriage for the past 5 years with Luis.  Although they don't have children, the couple started their business to increase their income. Abigail's father works making clay pots, and at the beginning, they bought and resold them. With time, Abigail also learned how to make flowerpots but she has planned to increase her merchandise and begin to paint them herself. \"I am very happy and grateful to Kiva and VisionFund M\u00e9xico for the opportunity to get a loan because then I will purchase flowerpots and plaster figurines to decorate and sell them, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe challenge Abigail faces is not having a truck big enough to transport all her merchandise so that many times when she leaves to sell in other communities, she has to make several trips to carry all the necessary flowerpots. On the other hand, her dream is to have a permanent retail location where she can sell her products without any problems although she would also like to improve her house.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Ma del Carmen and Araceli who will invest in plaster figurines, Feliciana in perfumes, Guadalupe and Jes\u00fas in making tortillas, while Lizeth and Rosalba will invest in clothing. \r\n\r\n*In the picture, Abigail is found behind Jes\u00fas who is dressed in a blue sweater.

She has 15 students who are in primary school. The school gets over at 3 PM and her students come for tuition classes after school at her home. The first shift of the tuition classes starts at 4 PM and the second shift at 6 PM,  after sunset. Since there are frequent shortages of power supply in the area, the children cannot concentrate on their lessons under candlelight and struggle to share and study their lessons in the dim light. It is the tutor\u2019s duty to teach them their lesson properly so that they get better knowledge and understanding through the tuition classes. \r\n\r\nFor their better study environment, the tutor took a solar loan from WSDS. After the solar home lighting was fixed in the house, the students were able to study their lessons with comfort, concentrate more, and were more attentive to their lessons without any disturbances of power cuts. She was happy that her students could study comfortably and was grateful to get such a loan from WSDS.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1672879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy mini solar home lighting ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-08-23T12:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-22T12:50:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Themneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjavah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjoujam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaikhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60865,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60865}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-26T17:18:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":754898,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica is a  mother of nine children, seven of whom graduated from school and are working.

She is from the small village of Madhya Boragari in Dhupguri, in Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal. Her husband is engaged in agricultural activities, and she has to look after her husband and son as well as help her husband in his work. She is a very hardworking and courageous lady. One of her sons is in grade two now. The other is too young for school. In her childhood, she did not get the opportunity to get higher education due to the poor financial resources of her parents. But she is earnestly trying to provide an education to her sons.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband cultivate different vegetables on the farm in different seasons and sell them to the market for their livelihood. Anita, being a hardworking woman, works in the field after managing her all household work. With experience in agricultural work, she has been able to get ahead despite the difficulties that have risen along the way, including rising costs of inputs and the instability of the prices for buying and selling vegetables.\r\n\r\nAs her sons have grown up and the family expenses are increasing day by day, she and her husband feel likely to further improve their agricultural activities. They have decided to cultivate paddy, which is an all-season crop, the staple food of West Bengal and in much demand throughout the year, so it will be a profitable business for her to generate income.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Anita is requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers, etc., to start paddy cultivation. She has a lot of faith and hopes to get ahead because her household expenses depend on this work.\r\n\r\nHer dream as a mother is to give a good education to her sons so that they can prosper in life.

When he saw that his uncle was able to open a successful restaurant, Darel realized that it was possible to break the cycle of financial hardship, and that entrepreneurship was the way to do it. He went to college to study business but when his son was born, he decided to put his education on hold and join the Navy to support his growing family\r\n\r\nA week after returning from his most recent deployment, Darel visited his barbershop for his regular trim. In the course of conversation, his barber broke the news that she was selling the business as her husband had just been stationed in another state. Darel mentioned to her that his step-dad was a barber and with one thing leading to another, she offered to sell Darel all the tools and equipment necessary for him to start his own barbershop.  Pro Style Barbershop was born. \r\n\r\nDarel couldn\u2019t be more ecstatic to finally be starting his own business. The first barber employed by Pro Style will be Darel\u2019s step-dad, who is moving to town with Darel\u2019s mother to help get the business off the ground. He has an additional barber ready to rent another of the six stations and will be having a mini job fair to fill the rest of the stations for rent. For now, Darel will keep his job with the Navy, while managing all of the aspects of his business on his off time. However, he is looking forward to eventually working there full-time cutting hair, so that he can have a more flexible schedule to spend more time with his kids.\r\n\r\nDarel recently moved his business to a location with a more reasonable rent and is requesting a loan to pay for the flooring of the new shop. \r\n\r\nHis advice for anyone looking to start a business: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a business major or guru to live out the dream of owning a business \u2013 all you need is drive and an unwavering determination to beat all adversities.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1630.5,"image":{"id":1672660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

She hopes that this investment will give her more income and with enough savings, she will be able to construct a permanent cabin for her shop, provide sufficient financial sustenance to her family, and give a better education to the children.\r\n\r\nShe wants to buy lands in the future with the profit generated from the business.

At the time he was growing up, there were no schools in the area so he had no choice but to start work in the fields. He married at the age of 25 and had two daughters. His wife is a housewife and looks after the home. His daughters are already grown and live separately. Only he and his wife live in their home.\r\n\r\nPedro has been a farmer for more than 60 years. As a young child his father set him on a good path so he became a very responsible person. In the local area there is no work other than farming that brings in an income. The land he farms is in an isolated area about a kilometre away; he goes there on foot.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his age Pedro is in good health, as good as he could hope for. When the work is particularly hard, he pays someone to help him. He works from 6am to 9am.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is seeking will be used to pay the rent on the land he farms as well as to buy seeds, manure, pesticide, herbicide and hire workers.

Meet Priscilla a wife, a mother, and a farmer with 14 years experience in mixed farming. She lives in Kitale, Kenya, together with her five children on a small piece of land that she inherited from her parents. Priscilla completed high school thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. \r\n\r\nThrough mixed farming she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of crops to the local market and neighbours. She passionately loves poultry farming and as she likes to say \u201cpoultry is close to my heart\u201d. Although this humble and ever smiling mother has been making profits selling poultry she faces challenges of lack of funds to buy good quality breeds of poultry and expand her poultry farming. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting for a loan to buy poultry. She has identified good breeds of poultry that will increase productivity and produce quality meat. Priscilla has enough poultry feed that is maize to give the poultry energy and green grams to give the poultry proteins and this will assure increased productivity. \r\n\r\nShe chose to join Juhudi Kilimo so that she can have access to quality loans at an affordable interest rate. Through the loan she will improve her living conditions and not only benefit from profits but she will get chicken manure. She will save a lot of cash that could have been spent on buying fertilizers. This loan will be a turning point in Priscilla\u2019s life since she will improve her living standards and secure the future of her school-going children.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1673130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-23T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-22T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pricilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1882.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2244.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2280.91},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2362.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2406.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2470.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2580.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2606.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2686.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2749.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2828.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2899.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.44,"local_amount":4752.26,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4887.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547663},{"amount":29.88,"local_amount":2561.17,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2633.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680665},{"amount":26.72,"local_amount":2290.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2355.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624951},{"amount":29.42,"local_amount":2521.42,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2593.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194031},{"amount":58.97,"local_amount":5054.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5197.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261938},{"amount":61.99,"local_amount":5313.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5464.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600207},{"amount":62.76,"local_amount":5636.96,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5797.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3,"payment_id":681377071},{"amount":20.08,"local_amount":1870.04,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1923.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.74,"payment_id":711505140}],"funded_date":"2014-08-23T19:04:36Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":754974,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a married woman.

She is 43 and has three children.  She has been involved in retail since a young age, though it was difficult for her at first because she did not have start-up capital. She began working for barely enough money to feed her family, but she was gradually able to increase her sales and provide for them. Sadbarghon currently sells clothing and various items for everyday use. She wants to give her children an education so that they will not suffer like their mother. At the moment her inventory is running out and she needs money increase it. She applied for a loan with Arvand and hopes for help with this problem. Sadbarghon wants to purchase inventory items for her business such as clothing, underwear, and other everyday items.

He says that his parents used to send him to school but he never liked it, and so he didn\u2019t attend to. He is married and his wife works making petates (woven mats made out of strips of palm leaves). \r\n\r\nHe is father of 3 children. One of them is in fourth grade, the other one in the second grade, and the youngest is in kinder. He only lives with his children and his wife.\r\n\r\nSantos buys and sells cattle, and also works sowing staple grains. It is an activity that he has done since he was a kid. Since he never liked going to school, he decided to follow the steps of his father, who is a farmer. He was the one that taught him the job. \r\n\r\nHe has trade cattle for the last 5 years, and he learned this activity from a business man he used to assist. He slowly began to show some interest for the business until he finally decided to go on his own. Now, he is the one in charge of the work, and the one that works hard enough to support his family, since his father suffers a disease that makes him unable to contribute.\r\n\r\nThe place where he works as a famer is 30 minutes away going by foot. When he works trading cattle, he has to go and buy the animals to a place located 15 kms away. Sometimes he goes by foot, and sometimes he goes by car. His schedule changes depending on the activity he has to perform.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to buy two dairy cows, which will help to support his family. By having his own production, he won\u2019t have to spend on dairy products. Besides, he will be able to sell part of the production which will benefit his economic conditions. \r\n\r\nSantos\u2019 dream is to buy more cattle for grazing, keeping the animals in good conditions, sell them to get some profits and in this way improve his business. For his daughters, he wishes they can study all that they want, if possible to finish a university career, so in the future they can have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1673543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy two dairy cows.

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one packet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Meriam would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. With the 20,000 PHP loan she will purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Meriam hopes to increase her inventory and product sales. She also wants to save money for her children and give them a better future. She meets each week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 53 years old and has children who are currently in school. She oversees the operation of their Jeepney (small bus) unit, and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which she is paid boundary* (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,500 PHP every day. Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippine.\r\n\r\nMargarita is requesting 10,000 PHP in loan assistance to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her Jeepney unit. She will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants to progress through her business and hopes that there will be improvement in their life through all her hard work. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

I specialize in Indonesian batik ornaments, but focus more in the classic styles of Yogya and Solo. The color I use is 'sogan,' or brown, a trademark of the Yogya-Solo style. I enjoy my work greatly, and hope that my customers take pleasure in sharing our rich cultural heritage.<br \/><br \/>\"I want to share and sell my Javanese batik works that we hand-paint on wood.
