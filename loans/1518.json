We worked this way until I married. My husband liked to carve coconut shells, and we enjoyed developing new styles and designs together, then I would make the samples. Now that I'm the sole provider for my children, I continue to carve coconut shells, and I also carve statuettes from wood. My children are my biggest motivation to work. I always keep my spirit up and go on strong for my children. Thanks to them.

As a son, our customs dictate I must replace my father's responsibilities with my family, as well as in social traditions and ceremonies in the community. Thus, my sisters came to live with me, my wife, daughter, and son, until they got married. Growing up in Bali, I saw people carving wood every day, as well as crafting silver jewelry. As a result, I had no difficulties when I started to work as a wood carver. With my talent and skills as a wood carver, and by observing people making jewelry, I started to work with silver, so I could earn a better income than as a wood carver. Bali is very rich in culture and arts, and I began to create my own designs with the help of four friends who are also silversmiths. My designs are inspired by Balinese culture, fashion, and nature.<br \/><br \/>\"I am starting to prepare items for the holiday rush and need capital. Last year, the microcredit was a great help.

She feels excited to continue running the business with support and assistance from Ruma.

This time she will continue using the loan to buy fish food and expand her fish farming. \r\n\r\nShe hopes this business plan will improve significantly her family income so that she can afford to buy her children new toys and books, as well as purchase some new furniture for her house. \r\n\r\nIn the picture, Thom stands first from the right on the first line, with a very pretty smile on her face."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1673839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish food for her fish business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Dien Bien","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":342,"posted_date":"2014-08-23T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-22T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Hong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Thom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Bien","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Oi(Linh)","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Om","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" On","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Suong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":37000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":37000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1087.25,"local_amount":22987627,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":23028010.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665047749},{"amount":240.96,"local_amount":5094528,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5103477.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681345666},{"amount":211.21,"local_amount":4465655,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-23T12:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4473500.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696555950},{"amount":210.58,"local_amount":4452190,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-30T12:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4460011.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711470186}],"funded_date":"2014-09-03T19:11:17Z","paid_date":"2015-09-30T12:10:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":755449,"name":"Cecep","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecep is a married man who lives with his wife and his three children in Sumedang, a small city located about two hours from Bandung, West Java.

The community is located in a sugar cane area and nearby there are three sugar factories where the sugar cane is taken through a series of processes to extract the sugar that's sold in the same area, and to companies known worldwide. On clear mornings, the tallest volcano in Mexico, Pico de Orizaba, can be seen from the highway.<br \/><br \/>Gregorio, the only man in the group, has worked for four years making and selling pizza, which he makes at home with his wife's help. He says that he was inspired to start this work by his love of Italian food and so he can one day do what he sees on TV (throw up the pizza dough without breaking it). He says that, at first, he sold pizza by the slice and only made two or three pizzas every three days while he gained customers. Today, Gregorio makes 5 or 6 pizzas, 4 or 5 are sold whole and the rest by the slice. Also, when there are gatherings at the elementary school, secondary school, and college in the region, they almost always contact him with orders. With the money he earns, he pays household expenses and reinvests in his business. <br \/><br \/>Gregorio needs to buy top quality merchandise (charcoal, flour, cheese, pineapple, ham, and pepperoni).

Each one of the members has a business activity with which they get income that they use to meet their families\u2019 needs.  Some of them have stable work or for a period of time during the season for cutting sugarcane.  The community is 100% involved with sugarcane.  \r\n\r\nThe business activities in the area are divided into two important periods.  There are six months of grinding the sugarcane in the refinery.  The sugar is sold to a global soft drink cola company, and it is also sold in the area.  During the harvest the workers are given six bales of sugar.  The other period, that is to say, the other six months are for repairing, which consists of providing maintenance to the machinery in the refinery.  This is done in order to proceed with grinding the sugar.\r\n\r\nFernando is one of the members of the group.  He is married to Elvira, and they have four children.  Six years ago he established his own workshop.  At first he worked with his uncle from whom he learned the mechanics trade.  However, he decided to become independent.  He now has his own earnings.

The income is insufficient, and they somehow manage to cover the expenses. However, lack of sufficient capital is a challenge that bars her from expanding her business.  With the aim of further improvement of their business, Menakabala thought to buy one more cow, which will help her to expand the business.\r\n\r\nMenakabala is seeking a loan from BJS to purchase a dairy cow. This amount of milk will greatly boost her sales volume.

In her childhood, she did not get the opportunity to advance her education level due to the poor financial resources of her parents. So, she is earnestly trying to provide education for her children.\r\n\r\nPhulmala and her husband do farm labor, such as weeding, caring for the crop, and other tasks, before harvesting the crops. They cultivate different vegetables in different seasons. With several years of experience in farm work, they have been able to get ahead despite the difficulties that have arisen along the way, including the rising cost of inputs and the instability of prices for buying and selling vegetables. Now that their children are growing up and the family expenses are increasing day by day, they feel the need to further improve their agricultural activities. They have decided to cultivate paddy, which is an all-season crop and, being the staple food of the regional people, is in much demand throughout the year. So, they think it will be a profitable business that will earn more income.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Phulmala is requesting a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS) to buy agricultural supplies, such as paddy seeds, fertilizers, etc., to start cultivation. She has a lot of faith and hope in getting ahead because her household expenses depend on this work. Her dream as a mother is to raise her children so they will be generous and noble citizens.

Stone mining is very popular in the area, and most of the people from her village are engaged in this occupation. The stones are being used for building purposes and construction of houses. \r\n\r\nShe supports her children from the income she gets from this occupation and manages to send them to school, too. Her husband is a farmer engaged in shifting cultivation. They have been working very hard to be self-reliant. The area that they live in has an insufficient power supply, which disturbs their day-to-day life, especially after sunset. Sometimes the current goes off for two to three consecutive days, which becomes the main problem of the people. The study hours after sunset for the children are affected by the present power situation, which leads to low academic performance. \r\n\r\nAfter availing the mini solar loan for house lighting, the children are now able to study well with no more disturbances from power cuts. Nemboi hopes that her children will study well and get decent jobs in the future to support their parents. She is very grateful to Kiva for lending such a loan. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group also face the same problem of insufficient power. In order to overcome this, they want to avail the loan so that they can buy mini solar home lighting systems that will provide them light after sunset for their homes.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1673522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a mini solar home lighting system so that the children can study well after sunset.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-08-24T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-23T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nempi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneivah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":85211,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":85211}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-26T13:42:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":755588,"name":"Pacita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pacita is 50 years old and married with six children.

It currently has 29 village customers, including 5 CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. <br \/><br \/>This village usually grows sesame, groundnuts and green gram, but suffers from drought and labor shortages. Most of the young people (>200) have migrated to other cities in search of economic opportunity.  They do this instead of working on the villages' farms. Especially during the busy seasons, farmers have to pay laborers $10 per day to weed. To generate additional income, villagers will sell handmade hats and work on construction sites. <br \/><br \/>The new loan will help those villagers to purchase fertilizer and topsoil to improve soil conditions for their crops. In the future, they want to set up a small grocery store where they can sell farming inputs to avoid traveling to other cities. As it is a larger investment, the additional income from farming is really important for them.<br \/><br \/>Pictured above are the committee members from the Kyauk Pone village CBO: U Aung, U Myo, U Min, U Htay, and U San.

Another reason why he stayed to help his father is because of their financial situation at the time.  Onicio is in a relationship and his wife takes care of the household duties.  They have five children (ages 18, 16, 13, 9, and 7) who are in school.  There are seven people living in his home and all of his family members are dependent on him.  <br \/><br \/>Onicio is a farmer who cultivates staple crops such as beans, corn, and sorghum.  He learned this trade thanks to his father who also planted these crops.  Using what he learned, Onicio is able to support his own family and look after them.  His crops are located near his house, so he does not have to walk very far.  Even though Onicio does not work on a set schedule, his crops need a great deal of care.  They must be protected against pests, so the crops must be fumigated and have fertilizer applied.  The crops must also be watered during times of drought.  Onicio goes about maintaining his crops to keep them free of pests, which will help to generate good seeds that he can sell for a profit in order to support his family.  <br \/><br \/>The loan he is requesting from CrediCampo will be used to buy staple products such as corn, beans, and rice because of the drought that the country is experiencing.  His harvests were not favorable, so he needs these staple goods to feed his family.  He will also buy seeds, compost, fertilizers, and pesticides for his new round of planted crops.  By obtaining the seeds, he can plant them and sell the output.  <br \/><br \/>In the future, Onicio plans to buy a plot of land for planting his crops.  This will allow him to produce more grain and generate more income.  He also wants to buy a calf that he can raise so that he can begin owning cattle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1673393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds, compost, fertilizers, and pesticides for his new crops, as well as staple goods for feeding his family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-24T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-23T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Onicio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":225.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":274.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":156.62,"local_amount":156.62,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":156.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611770164},{"amount":79.22,"local_amount":79.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":79.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832799},{"amount":264.16,"local_amount":264.16,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":264.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711453687}],"funded_date":"2014-09-22T21:32:11Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:50:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":755415,"name":"Maa Laxmi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maa Laxmi Self Help Group (SHG) was formed in May 2014.

Her family belongs to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day. Her children are continuing schooling in the village school. \r\n\r\nPriyabati has been running a spice selling business with items like onion, garlic, chili, cumin seeds, coriander, etc., for the last eight years. Her husband goes to five weekly markets of her locality in a week with the bulk of the items on a bike and sells in the market. Apart from this, she also cultivates vegetables and has a vegetable vending business. Her monthly income from the existing business is 5,000 rupees. Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses and spent some income for the education of her children in a very cut short manner. \r\n\r\nShe wants to increase stock in her business to earn more income for the better livelihood of her family. So the loan will be utilized to purchase more of the items like onion, garlic, chili, cumin seeds, coriander, etc., she sells in bulk to keep the stock up for a month. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she will replenish her stock frequently, and she can add a substantial income to her present income. Priyabati hopes to provide a better education to her children and construct a good house.\r\n\r\nThe other ten members of the group are doing milk businesses, footwear selling, a general store, vegetable cultivation, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1673752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing onion, garlic, chili, cumin seeds, coriander, etc., to earn more income for the better livelihood of her family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Thakpali,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-08-24T06:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-23T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"At        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chhamedei ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gitanjali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gulamani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayamani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pankajini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priyabati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sajani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shakuntala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Umakanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":152000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":152000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":757162,"name":"Benkadi 5 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les 10 membres du groupe  Benkadi 5  sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 42 ans, 3 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 Kolomosso, un des villages de Koutiala, 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali.

Chandrakala, the straightforward and positive lady, is one of them. She hails from a middle class family. The lady standing fourth from left in the photo raising her hand is Chandrakala. She is 42 years old and lives with her husband and two sons, aged 10 and 5 years. \r\n\r\nChandrakala has been running a press paper plate making unit in her house for last five years with the help of her husband. She has a couple of leaf plates pressing machines. She supplies her products to the retailers of the same town and other villages within a 20 miles radius. She also takes orders for making plates for different social ceremonies like marriage, festivals, etc.\r\n\r\nShe purchases raw materials like paper and polythene from the nearest wholesale market 200 kilometers away on a monthly basis. She gets a monthly income of 6,000 rupees from the above business. Out of this income, she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. Due to the better quality of her product and timely delivery, the demand for her units is on the rise. But to meet the orders of the purchasers, funding was a problem for her. So she desires to spread out her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. From the present loan, Chandrakala has intended to purchase a volume of raw materials like paper, polythene, plates, bowls and glass frames, and to buy a press machine for making plastic glass. This will help her to decrease her purchasing and transport expenditures as well as catch the attention of more clients. Chandrakala hopes to accumulate a sufficient amount for construction of a good house and provide a better education to her sons. \r\n\r\nThe other 11 members of the group are running general stores, vending vegetables, vending groundnuts, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1673771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of a volume of paper, polythene, plate and bowl frames, glass frames, etc., and buy a press machine for making plastic glass.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-08-24T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-23T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhumi      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrakala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanamati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Drupadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haripriya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunjalata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madhabi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumukhi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":172000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":172000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-31T22:33:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":755573,"name":"Asri Lestari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The result from the pig sales of the Asri Lestari group is very good.

Meet Mary, 56 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Mwitha, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and is blessed with seven adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 15 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Kitale area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 40,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":469.66,"image":{"id":1674066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Benedate, 50 years of age, a very hardworking, progressive and honest farmer from a very remote village in Ndalu in the Kitale area of Kenya. This area is very fertile with favorable weather patterns that support farming activities. She is happily married and a proud mother of 3 children, and together they live on a small piece of land that she really treasures.\r\n\r\nHer primary source of income has been eggs, milk and a variety of food crops that she plants on her farm. She also engages in transportation and some small business so as to make ends meet. Although this humble and industrious mother makes profits, she faces the challenge of not producing enough to meet the ready market that is already there.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking funds from Kiva lenders to put up a greenhouse. Greenhouse farming is a very profitable agricultural venture in Kenya. Greenhouse farming is the production of crops within sheltered structures, and Benedate plans to grow crops within controlled conditions, thereby protecting the crops against the vagaries of weather and against pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will increase her yields and will have continuous harvest of crops. A greenhouse will enable Benedate to grow and harvest crops within a short time, and this will improve her income because, after a short time, she will be able to gain more income. Through the loan, she is going to permanently change her life, and challenges such as pest and disease will never be a problem because of the sheltered nature of the greenhouse. This loan will make Benedate realize her dream of getting out of poverty, and she will be able to secure the future of her

Francisca quiere invertir su pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda como leche, productos enlatados, refrescos, sal, az\u00facar, etc.\nAs\u00ed como Do\u00f1a Francisca, los dem\u00e1s miembros est\u00e1n muy contentos porque su pr\u00e9stamo ayudar\u00e1 a su respectivo negocio: Reyna invertir\u00e1 en rebosos; Maria Guadalupe R, Ma Guadalupe C y Tomasa, en borregos; Gloria y Miguel, en reces; Benita y Diana, en su tienda de abarrotes; Patricia, en pollos y Ma Cristina en su cibercaf\u00e9. Adem\u00e1s de las actividades antes mencionadas, todas ellas elaboran servilletas, artesan\u00edas que venden para obtener dinero extra.\n","en":"The members of this group are very cheerful and responsible people. They live in a very tranquil community in Mexico State. \r\nFrancisca, who is the group representative, is 38 years old and has been married to Victor for 23 years. Together, they have raised a family of three children who are in school. Francisca opened a grocery store 10 year ago. Back then, she only sold sodas, candy, and snacks. The quantity and variety of her merchandise wasn't outstanding, and neither was the number of customers she had. Later, she heard a talk by VisionFund M\u00e9xico and decided to request a loan to invest more strongly in her business and to buy other products. This is how she started to grown her profits. Francisca commented \"I wanted  to start this business because it is more convenient for me, I don't need to leave the house to earn a living for my family. Raising animals is also a very good option but I like to have contact with people.\" The challenge that she faces is the lack of a good electricity source for selling cold meats. She says that, in her community, the electricity service goes out often and her refrigerator can't keep these products in a good state. Francisca wants to use her loan to buy more merchandise such as milk, dairy products, sodas, salt, sugar, etc.\r\nLike Francisca, the other members are very happy because the loan will help their respective businesses: Reyna will invest in scarves, Maria Guadalupe R. and Maria Guadalupe C and Tomasa will invest in sheep, Gloria and Miguel in cows, Benita and Diana in their grocery store, Patricia in chickens, and Maria Cristina in her cybercafe. In addition to the activities already mentioned, they all make napkins, crafts that they sell to make extra money.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6975,"image":{"id":1671824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, dairy products, sodas, salt, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Lagunita, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-08-24T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-23T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":6975,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":54.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":91000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10521.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10754.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10993.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":11236.81},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11485.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":11740.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":12000.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12266.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":806.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":824.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":842.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":861.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":880.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":899.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":919.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":940.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":806.46,"local_amount":10521.5,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10539.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530255716},{"amount":1667.01,"local_amount":21748.86,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":21786.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690534},{"amount":1741.71,"local_amount":22723.41,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":22763.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561823514},{"amount":1773.75,"local_amount":23741.98,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":23783.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":46.03,"payment_id":579807723},{"amount":931.73,"local_amount":12264.25,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":12285.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.31,"payment_id":595349823}],"funded_date":"2014-08-24T14:10:43Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":755538,"name":"Denis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr Denis tiene 24 a\u00f1os proviene de una familia muy trabajadora y sacrificada.

She is originally from Chinandega, located in the west of the country. She is characterized as being a hard-working, responsible woman with the desire for personal improvement.  Because of a lack of resources, she couldn't finish her schooling, ending only at the secondary level. Due to this, since she was very young, she has had to work to help with the household expenses. Thanks to her spirit and her desire to get ahead, she decided to open a general store where she offers products for daily consumption such as packets of coffee, packets of shampoo, rice, sugar, milk, beans, bread, eggs, detergent, tomato sauces, oil, frozen products, soft drinks, juices, cookies, and candies among others. The store is located in her house, and for 18 years she has worked in this business, which also offers general merchandise such as lingerie, barrettes, glue, shampoo, talcum powder, an assortment of clothing, notebooks, diapers, perfumes, and sandals among other products. She makes her purchases in cash and has regular and occasional customers. One of her dreams is to be able to expand her business and in this way get more profits to be able to do other future projects. The goal of this new loan is to invest in her business due to the increasing demand. For this, she needs to stock more inventory in both businesses by purchasing products for household consumption such as basic grains, frozen products, soft drinks and general merchandise such as an assortment of clothing styles, bed spreads, perfumes, and shampoo among others. In this way she will offer a better service to her customers so that in the not-so-distant future she can have increased income. Juana del Carmen is grateful for the help that the Kiva investors offer to people of limited resources and in poor countries such as Nicaragua in order to have a dignified means of work.

is a 32-year-old married woman who lives with her family near Lahore, Pakistan. She is the mother of five children, three of whom go to school. One of her sons helps his father with raising cattle. Her husband is a cattle trader and does most of his trading within his home area. He breeds cattle in his yard and sells them at a local market. He has to feed each calf for one or two years until it is grown up and healthy, which is a very lengthy and expensive process. He wants to buy a heifer to continue breeding cattle, but he already invested his all savings to build a cowshed. Therefore, Rubina has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner Brac Pakistan, so her husband can buy bull calves and heifers for his cattle farming. Fetal diseases are the major challenge for him. He hopes that he will pay all the installments on time. With the profits he will buy fodder for his cattle and cures for diseases. Rubina is very pleased after receiving this loan and thankful to Kiva and Brac Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1674126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy bull calves and heifers for her husband's cattle farm.

They are applying for a loan of 290,000 YER from AMB. Mawaheb is the leader of the group. She is a 40-year-old married woman with three children. Her oldest child is 12 years old, and the youngest is 5. They live together in a rented house in the capital city, Sana'a. She has a secondary education certificate. Now, she is an employee in a private sector since she has that certificate. Her husband works outside the country. He rarely calls and connects with his family, and he does not spend much on it. Mawaheb cannot depend on the support of her husband. Mawaheb\u2019s salary is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family, and her house lacks many home appliances.

families in KOMALABA, a village in Commune de KOUORO, Cercle de SIKASSO (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali.) The women are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their farm work during the rainy season. They are on their third loan with the institution. The previous loans were indeed paid back.\r\n\r\nThe crop grown is peanuts, as is the case with Ms. NOUMOUSSO (standing first at the right in the photo of this women\u2019s group KILEKANI 6). With her loan, she intends to purchase two 50-kg sacks of fertilizer and 2 containers of herbicide and to pay for plowing to maintain 0.5 hectare.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest, the produce is sold to a customer base composed of men and women paying with cash or credit in the village and in SIKASSO. She plans on making an average profit of 74,000 francs CFA per planting. This profit will enable her to pay back her loan and also to help out her husband in covering day-to-day family expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1676244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for fertilizer, herbicides, and plowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Komalaba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-24T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-23T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":45.43,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noumousso\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":175000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":329.57,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-29T11:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":184815.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":45.43,"payment_id":636515507}],"funded_date":"2014-08-24T23:23:55Z","paid_date":"2015-04-29T11:02:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":755708,"name":"Mercyline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercyline is 32 years old.

He is considered a pacesetter when it comes to farming in his village of Bosamaro in the Nyamira area of Kenya. Having done mixed farming for the past five years, he has gained much experience and he offers free extension services to young upcoming farmers. He is happily married and is blessed with two lovely school-going children. \r\n\r\nJared enjoys generating income from selling milk, his harvest, and produce from his farm. He finds dairy farming very fulfilling but the main challenge he faces is not being able to properly feed his dairy cows. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan he will be able to cut hay into small pieces before mixing it with other forage to feed his cattle. The chaff cutter will aid his cattle in digestion and will prevent his dairy cattle from rejecting any part of their food. Proper feeding of your cattle is one of the most important factors in maintaining high yield production of milk. Through proper feeding, his cow will produce more milk and this will translate to more profits and improved living standards. \r\n\r\nWhen he was asked how this loan will benefit his family, Jared said \u201cmore income\u201d. Profits from the loan will be used in fully repaying the loan and improving standards of living for his parents, family, and his school-going

Meet Joel, a husband, a proud father of five lovely adorable children, a farmer and a member of Tuiyobei self-help group in the Kitale area of Kenya. Being a small-hold farmer, Joel practices mixed farming on his small piece of inherited land. He has seven years of experience in this field, and his primary sources of income are milk, crops and some personal business that he does to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nJoel passionately loves poultry farming; as he likes to put it, \u201cpoultry is close to my heart\u201d. He would like to buy more poultry, but raising money to do so is a challenge for him. Juhudi Kilimo is a micro finance organization that works with partners such as Kiva to help aspiring people like Joel improve their living conditions through training and financial support. \r\n\r\nJoel is seeking a loan from Kiva to buy more poultry in order to take advantage of the ready market that exists. Through the loan he is expecting to collect between three to five crates of eggs daily, and this will immediately increase his profit margins. As well, his family will benefit from an improved diet. Joel's farm will also benefit because poultry manure has high nitrogen, which will increase crop productivity. This will relieve Joel of the heavy burden of buying expensive fertilizer. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Joel's family will never lack their basic needs, and they will have improved standards of living. He waits for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1674282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

When asked what he enjoys about poultry farming he replied that he enjoys \u201cpicking the eggs every day in the morning.\u201d However, this humble and honest man faces challenges of not meeting the demand for eggs and also not satisfying his ever-increasing client base. That is why he is requesting a loan - to buy good quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture and the demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for so many people. Other than increased profits he will benefit from poultry manure hence saving more money that could have been used in buying fertilizer. Through increased income from egg, poultry meat selling and feathers he will permanently change his living conditions and secure the future of his school going children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":529.34,"image":{"id":1674344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural
