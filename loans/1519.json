Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about Le 2,300,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

He entered this line of work to honor his grandparents, and because it was part of his inheritance from them. Today he wants to leave the business to one of his grandchildren whom he has raised and cared for and who helps him in his work.\r\n\r\nThe loan money will be used to buy improved vegetable seeds and to set up a greenhouse, since he's receiving help from a personal farming technician.

He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of silver for his designs.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWayan has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I was born in a village called Banjar Apuan Singapadu, Sukawati on the island of Bali. I am the eldest of three children from a family of artists, but I was the first in my family to work with silver. I started to learn at the age of fifteen as an apprentice in my village with a good but strict teacher. If I made one piece just a little bit wrong he would be so angry with me, but he also taught me how to work under stress and short time limits. A good foundation, if you ask me! After five years I started on my own to produce original pieces that I sold to local shops. And slowly I was able to save enough money to make my own workshop at home, where I work still until this day. My main inspirations come from nature and the daily life around me. Flowers and animals are my favorite subjects, but sometimes abstract geometrical shapes come into my mind, even though they are inspired strongly by nature originally.

There are now three water basins which are still in need of repair that supply water for the entire village. Especially in the hot summer, the whole village suffers from a lack of reliable water supply.  Additionally, the village does not have a health clinic, so villagers need to travel to neighboring towns for medical attention.\r\n\r\nThe new loan will enable this community to purchase fertilizer, compost, and topsoil to improve soil conditions and increase the production and quality of crops. Farmers mainly cultivate sesame, groundnuts, millet and pigeon pea. With extra income from crop sales, they usually buy goats to raise at home. Some people want to increase their incomes by opening a small grocery store in the village, working on construction sites, or tapping toddy-palm trees for sugar.  Additionally, the CBO committee members are planning to purchase a small truck for the village's common use in order to solve transportation problems in getting harvested crops to markets.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the CBO village: U Khin, Daw Win, U Win, U Myo, and U Aung. Included in the photo (third from the right) is U Win, who is 38 years old and married.  His main income is farming, but he also works as a broker in off seasons. He has five family members, and three of them are still students. Two students are attending middle school in the village.  He used his past loan for farming inputs and will use his next loan to buy pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":11025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":11025,"image":{"id":1673018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to help 54 villagers buy fertilizer, compost, and topsoil to improve soil conditions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Magway","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2014-08-25T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-24T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":11025,"lender_count":332,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":79.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hpa Lan Pin Village","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":10650000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":11025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":10650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10945.96,"local_amount":10650000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10672200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":79.04,"payment_id":636452253}],"funded_date":"2014-08-27T03:00:37Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:56:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":757867,"name":"Wuyetegue 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les 7 membres du groupe  WUYETEGUE 2 sont des hommes mari\u00e9s  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 46 ans et ont en moyenne 8 enfants et vivant la plupart  dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e0 N'GOLOKO un village dans la commune de DOGONI dans le cercle de SIKASSO 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nIls  collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nIls sont \u00e0 leur deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00eat de production de ma\u00efs avec l\u2019institution de microfinance soro yiriwaso, les pr\u00eats ant\u00e9rieurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement rembours\u00e9s.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est de ma\u00efs  avec monsieur SILAMENI d\u00e9bout \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me position de la droite vers la gauche sur la photo dans ce groupe d\u2019homme  WUYETEGUE 2. \nAvec son pr\u00eat, il compte acheter  8 sacs de 50 kg d\u2019engrais, 10 bidons d\u2019herbicide de qualit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente, payer les frais de labour  pour entretenir  1 hectare. \nApr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte la production est vendue au niveau du village, \u00e0 SIKASSO \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019homme et de femme au comptant et \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit. \nIl compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de  160 000 FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer d\u2019une part son pr\u00eat et son int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u2019autre part de contribuer  les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes de la famille.\n","en":"The 7 members of the 'Wuyetegue 2' Group are all married men who are, on average, 46 years old and have 8 children.

The village always celebrates Buddhist cultural ceremonies, such as offering provisions to monks.\r\n\r\nThe new loan will enable borrowers to hire laborers to help with harvesting and to purchase high quality seeds for next season. Capital for harvesting expenses is essentially needed because the farmers have to harvest the crops very soon. For next season, additional capital is needed to purchase quality seeds for crops such as groundnuts, pigeon pea, and green gum. One grain of those seeds costs, on average, $50. They also have to cultivate millet to feed their cows. In addition, the village is now raising funds to build a well at the monastery, where every household can get enough water for domestic use. Currently, the village has only one old well to supply water. \r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from Myin Su Village CBO: U Win, U Thein, U Than, U Kyaw and U Than.

He and his wife are working together to provide for their family. Aside from his tricycle, he also has a farm and a variety store for additional income.\r\n\r\nHe would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of their tricycle unit. His profits from his business will definitely help him to sustain their daily needs and the educational expenses of his children. He looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in his heart.\r\n\r\nDaniel hopes that his business will last longer and dreams to give his family a better living. He meets up every week with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work. It is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

It consists of four women, living in Sana'a, Yemen. They asked for a loan of 220,000 YER from AMB. Nada is a 31-year-old married woman with four children, living with them in their own house. She is the leader of the group. She works as a housewife, and she is very dynamic and vigorous. Her husband works as an auto mechanic. He is the sole breadwinner of the family and his income is not enough to cover all the necessary needs of the house. The house where Nada and her husband live is very old and needs a renovation and the doors of the rooms and the bathroom are very old and need to change. Nada's husband is unable to change the doors because his income is very low. He needs financial support. For this reason, Nada decided to help him in that responsibility.

This is why Adelio is requesting a loan to buy a fishing boat, so he can improve his family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1674525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a fishing boat and improve his family's quality of life.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-08-25T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-24T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":325.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":332.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":366.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":370.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":386.29},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":407.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":413.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":449.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":464.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":481.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":497.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":505.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.19,"local_amount":325.42,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-22T09:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":326.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":531211407},{"amount":48.18,"local_amount":332.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":333,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542512664},{"amount":53.8,"local_amount":371.02,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":371.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561645969},{"amount":52.97,"local_amount":365.26,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":365.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556461},{"amount":56.1,"local_amount":386.93,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":387.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157150},{"amount":466.76,"local_amount":3219.02,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554055}],"funded_date":"2014-08-30T20:16:29Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":756294,"name":"Emerlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emerlinda is a 50-year-old married woman with four children (2 attend school).

She was born in one of the municipalities in the north of Chinandega, located in the western part of the country. She is known for being a hard working and responsible woman, with a strong drive to get ahead. She is an entrepreneur and administrator of her own business, a tortilla shop; she also sells baked beans and nacatamales (Nicaraguan tamales). She does her shopping in markets in this area and in neighbouring regions; her sales are done in cash and on credit which she gets daily. She\u2019s had her business for more than 12 years located in her house. She has regular and potential clients. Because of her lack of economic resources, she wasn\u2019t able to go to university and she began working at a young age, as her parents were limited financially and she had to work with them. She had younger siblings and this was a way to help a little with household expenses. \r\n\r\nNowadays she strives daily to provide her children with a better future. She began her business with her own money. Her day actually begins from the previous day, cooking maize. Later she wakes up at 4 am, washes the maize and grinds it and makes the first batch of tortillas. Later she cooks the other maize at 9 am to prepare the tortillas at noon and the last batch is cooked at 4 pm. The beans are put in the first and last batches. On the weekends she makes delicious nacatmales (Nicaraguan tamales), which she sells on the streets or in her own house.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is that her children can have the opportunity to study and be professionals. Also she wants to make some improvements in her house, to give her children better security. That is why Dania is requesting a loan to invest in capital for her work and stock her supply of raw material to make tortillas such as corn, firewood, lime, gas, matches, hotplates, plastic bags, leaves, achiote, potatoes, yerba buena (mint) rice, rope, beans, garlic etc...\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1675245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They live in a rural village, Mouyamari in Jalpaiguri district.\r\n\r\nTapasi's husband, aged 31 years, is engaged in a shuttering business. Tapasi acknowledged the fact that the income from her husband's business was barely enough to meet the daily expenses. She started rearing cattle to provide a good education to her children and to support her family financially. She purchased a cow and supplies milk to her neighbors. Despite her childhood being ruined, as she could not get a good education and only attended school till primary level, she never gave up her fighting spirit and became financially independent. She is a young, courageous woman who is willing to work harder.\r\n\r\nShe seeks a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy a dairy cow and increase her dairy business.

She is a 40-year-old single mother of two children who are in school. Betty operates a restaurant located in Nateete in a market stall and has been in business for the last 10 years. She saved some money when she was working for a friend and began her own business. Betty believed that working for others could not generate enough income to support her family very well.
