He is married and has 3 children, ages 12, 8, and 6. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mayah established his beverage business. He began his business because he wants to generate funds to further his education and that is his only source of income. Working 7 days a week and 20 hours a day, he earns about 1,200,000 SLL every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL in order to buy soft drinks, stout, Maltina and parrot brand drinks. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 200,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mayah plans to further his education, take good care of his parent and to give his children a quality education. The persistent increase in the general price level is his major business challenge. He thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":813046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy soft drinks, stout, Maltina and parrot drinks for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-07-20T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":375000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226991381},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232750505},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239736537},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244513836},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721657},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124575},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505495},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":377562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974629}],"funded_date":"2011-08-15T18:07:09Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":322052,"name":"Hieng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Both Mrs. Hieng and her husband support their family by fishing in the Basaac River.

He is a hardworking man and aggressive with the principle of truth on his lips; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. \r\n\r\nKaplamai in the local dialect means valley. In this valley are a people who, in their totality, constitute wrenching statistics. Hardcore poverty pervades every homestead, yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about two thousand bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. \r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, James has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past seven years. His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry and some \u201cside hustles\u201d he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. The Kaplamai area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a sea of people but the mill keeps breaking down; hence farmers are not able to grind their maize. James intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill, which will grind corn or maize into flour. \r\n\r\nMaize meal is very common in Kenya and is a staple food for many communities. Many Kenyan families consume the maize product \u201cugali\u201c (hard porridge) regularly. The market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. Through this loan, James will be able to grind maize faster because he will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be long history because electric posho mills are more reliable. \r\n\r\nThis loan will assist James to permanently change his life and achieve his life mission of driving economic development and poverty alleviation in communities in arid and semi-arid areas. Profits from the posho mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan, which James promises to fully repay on time. In the next two years, James sees himself as a very established businessman who will be running more than one posho mill in his remote village. James patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1813274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Kim Th\u1ecb (0) is a 32 year-old woman who lives in the town of \u0110\u00f4ng anh - H\u00e0 n\u1ed9i. V. is the leader of a two-member loan group sponsored by SEDA. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is M\u1ea1ch Tr\u00e0ng (1).\r\n\r\nV. is married and has 3 school-aged children. To making a living, V. operates a family member's general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. V. has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, V. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. V. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.028.000 VND from SEDA that she used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 5.450.000 VND to purchase additional products to sell. This will be V.'s 5th loan from SEDA. V. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her house.\r\n\r\n<P>&nbsp;<\/P>\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\u0110\u00e0o Th\u1ecb P.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n<P>&nbsp;<\/P>\r\n<P>&nbsp;<\/P>\r\n<HR>\r\n\r\nV.

She needed to establish herself in this line of work because she had to move to this area due to her oldest son\u2019s health problems\r\n\r\nShe used to travel to Lima constantly to bring merchandise to fill orders she had.  However, now she is exclusively dedicated to raising animals and to a small store that she is starting to set up.\r\n\r\nShe usually raises barnyard fowl and guinea pigs, which she then sells to merchants that visit the area where she lives. She sometimes sells to her neighbors, as well.  Her duck production has increased recently so she needs to expand.  She is asking Edpyme Alternativa for an initial loan of 1000 new soles that she will use to buy nutritionally balanced feed.\r\n\r\nAnny is an active, very hard-working woman.  Her greatest wish is to have her business grow so that she can finish building her house and offer her children a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":483706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy nutritionally balanced animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Guayaquil - Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-02-05T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anny Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":74.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":76.76},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":78.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":81.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":82.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":87.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":89.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.95},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.07},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":101.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.19},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.39,"local_amount":41.12,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":41.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934576},{"amount":26.03,"local_amount":74.36,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":74.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662181},{"amount":26.86,"local_amount":76.76,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":76.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694884},{"amount":27.43,"local_amount":78.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":78.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877931},{"amount":28.62,"local_amount":81.76,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":81.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617965},{"amount":28.8,"local_amount":82.3,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":82.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832365},{"amount":197.87,"local_amount":565.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":565.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098983}],"funded_date":"2010-02-05T22:06:53Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":178356,"name":"Laurencia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mrs. Laurencia G. is 52 years old, married, and a resident of Minsubong, Tangub City.

He is 35 years old, married, and has two children who are nine and 12 years old.  Reuben was only able to attend school through 10th grade due to a lack of support. For five years, Reuben has been selling jeans at the Red Light Market in Paynesville, which is near Monrovia.  He says he sells the jeans in an encouraging manner, which keeps customers returning.  One of the challenges he faces is that there are many competitors in the market. Reuben plans to use his 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more jeans.  His goal is to open a beauty salon one day. In the photo that accompanies this profile, Reuben is the one holding the sign. \r\n \r\nAbout LEAP:\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His mother was not able to provide them with all the necessary things and this is why he started to do business early. He was helping his relatives by selling merchandise and making money. Besides that he learned to grow agriculture crops and animal husbandry. At this time he buys and sells food products. To increase his working capital he has been taking out the loan for the third time. His previous loans gave a big effect as he has grown his business a lot and improved his living conditions. Azizbek wants to get a loan in the amount of $1,500USD to buy agriculture crops.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

Although his farm is small, it has been providing for him and his family for about 20 years. He is now seeking to make an investment in order to make his lands become more productive. He wants to invest in fertilizers and pesticides in order to improve the rice he grows. William and his family also raise pigs on their farm, only selling them when they are in need of money. William has his rice processed and commercialized at his association\u2019s facilities. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> He is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

She lives in the Jesus neighborhood in the municipality of Juticalpa and makes and sells corn tortillas.\r\n<p>\r\nLeniz graduated with a degree in business administration and was looking for work for several months but wasn\u2019t able to find anything.  Then, since she had an urgent need to help her family support the household, she decided to start her own business.  That\u2019s how she began her tortilla shop, and, although at first it was a small business, today she already has two employees.  She began the business two years ago.\r\n<p>\r\nHer work day begins at 4:00 a.m. and ends at noon.

His wife helps him on the weekends which are always busier at these markets. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He needs this loan in order to fix up his stand. He will also buy much larger quantities of fish at discount prices. He believes that this will help him increase his revenue and profit. With the increased money from the loans he plans to also fix up the run down walls and floor of his home. He is also planning on converting the rooms where his kids lived to an apartment he can rent out for a complimentary source of income.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jose is 56 years old, is married and has three children. His wife has been his right hand for the business as she has always had the capacity to take lead as well as assist. He has three college aged kids who have jobs but who he still helps financially.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

She also works every day to ensure that the people who depend on her are satisfied. She has always been characterized by her immense thirst for knowledge and it is thanks to this that in her younger years she decided to study sociology. She always had a desire to observe and help others in building a better society; it is because of this that she chose the same course of study as her husband. A few years later, when her husband retired, they received a pension for his years of service. After analyzing their community, they saw a demand and decided to open a small business to continue to meet their needs successfully and quickly. Rosa began work on a grain mill and her husband on a plant producing herbs. Through their tireless efforts they have been able to provide for education and wellbeing of their daughters and hope to continue with their youngest daughter who is 14. Now she would like to begin and increase different services in her mill to be able to continue offering excellent service to the local families who depend on her, besides the usual discounts and promotions, with the hope that they too might benefit from the final sale of their products.

He has experience in this business as he has always helped with the cultivation of crops in his home community of Istaravshan, Tajikistan. Now he is the father of two kids who are the main motivation for him.  Bunyod has managed to improve his family\u2019s economic situation thanks to the help received from  IMON International through a loan that he has used directly for his agricultural business. On this occasion, Bunyod is looking for IMON International\u2019s help so that he can benefit from technical assistance in his farming so that when harvest time comes around he can improve his economic situation.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\n<p>Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For now, the engine of their boat was badly destroyed and a loan with small interest is \nreally  a big help to buy new one to help them continue their family

P. is 41 years old and lives with his wife and their two children in Los Tijos de Upala, located in the province of Alajuela.  It is a rural community with a relatively large area and somewhat mountainous topography, located in Costa Rica.  The community works especially in the agriculture of basic grains, and on a lessor scale, raising livestock.\r\n\r\nFor 3 years Angel has worked sowing papaya seeds.  Therefore, he says he possesses quite a lot of experience in the care and maintenance of this kind of cultivation.  He has a small plot of land in which he has planted papaya previously and has had very good results.  Because of this, he wishes to expand his plantation.  Thanks to this business, his family's quality of life has improved considerably.  \r\n\r\nWhat Angel is currently requesting is a loan of \u00a2680,000 colones to buy fertilizer, seeds, and different materials in order to give the best maintenance and assistance possible to his harvest.  This way he will be rewarded and will be able to have a very good production.\r\n\r\nAngel is a part of the Empresa de Credito Comunal de Los Tijos, one of 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his third credit, and he says that with it he hopes to continue growing as a small entrepreneur and keep his business moving forward.  He also emphasizes that thanks to these types of organizations and means of facilitating credit, he is able to dedicate more time to productive activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Valeriana has been engaged in her business for over 10 years already.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Valeriana joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan  from CEVI. Valeriana is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support her family. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She wishes to increase her income in order to offer a better education to her children, and this is why she would like to buy more products and expand the production of her homemaD. bread, which sells very well in her neighborhood. The other members dedicate themselves to different activities such as the sale of chocolate bars, meat pies, meals, meat pies, soft drinks, manicure services and renting out of weeding carriages. As it happens with every job, these women face a hard competition: some days they earn money, and some others they don\u2019t, but thanks to their experience they know how to get by.

city of Temuco. These individuals have diverse livelihoods. Some sell things like vegetables, sausages, and salads; others sell new and second-hand clothing items.There is an owner of a local grocery store, a clerk, and a hairstylist. Still others produce and sell things like pastries and apparel.\r\n \r\nRosa is the treasurer of the group. In the photo Rosa can be found in the third row and third form left to right wearing a red jacket and her hair is loose. Rosa\u2019s business is of apparel of various items, for example formal clothing and sport outfits, costumes and curtains, and other things. Rosa studied hemming and costumes for three years and she has made it her profession for the past 25 years. Rosa\u00b4s workshop is located in her house, where she counts on three machines and works on set orders from clients. Rosa plans to use this loan to generate more items such as the traditional Chilean outfit of a huaso y huasa chileno, being that September is the month when Chile hosts various patriotic parties. Rosa also plans to purchase some fabric to fabricate polar shirts, as she has already collected some orders for this type of material. \r\n\r\nRosa\u00b4s goal is to purchase a sewing machine that does intrinsic borders; she also dreams of one day extending out her workshop.

Her husband, Antony, who is 22 years old, works abroad as an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) to support his family. They have a 2-year-old child. \r\n\r\nMarites joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marites has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, lifting her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000. She intends to use this to purchase dry goods for her store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Marites C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

T. lives with his wife and two children in Talin city. The main income for the family comes from agriculture and exploiting Gagik\u2019s truck. The truck was obtained thanks to Gagik\u2019s savings and the loan he took previously from SEF. Although Gagik only uses the truck for four months during the agricultural high season, the profit from that period helps the family a lot. Gagik has also acquired a good reputation as a mechanic and is able to earn some income from providing services in that field too. Gagik and his wife take care of their small farm and also cultivate land. To increase their number of cattle and maintain the machinery, Gagik has applied for this loan.

Her husband is a trader. \r\n\r\nShe is a housewife who sells shoes and jewelry, both door to door and from her house where her merchandise is readily available to customers. She takes cash and also credit, but only in two installments.

She lives in the town of La Playa with her spouse and her two children, aged 5 and 15. She has a business offering telecommunications services and video games, called \u201cComun\u00edcate ya\u201d [\"Get in touch now\"]. She opened the business after receiving severance pay from a company where she used to work. She started with two computers and two simple tables in the city of Santa Marta, where she lived at that time, and she worked alongside her daughter while also pursuing her household activities. When she moved to the city of Barranquilla, she set up the same business, and she gradually added more computers. Later, she added more services: online video games, photocopying, scanning, fax and transcriptions. Currently, her business has expanded and she is renovating her shop to better organize her business and offer better service. Her goal for the future is to continue studying, since she is a college student and dreams of studying computer programming and systems analysis so that she will know more about the subject and can improve her business. She is currently applying for her first Kiva loan, financed through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which she will buy two computers, two tables and two chairs, because vacation time is approaching and she wants to offer better service since demand will be increasing. Her greatest challenge is the lack of working capital that would let her achieve her goals rapidly and keep working. With the Kiva financing, she can increase her opportunities to invest and multiply her investment. Currently, her financial indicator of profitability on sales is 56%, and she maintains a contribution margin of 64.28%, and she is planning for growth on that basis."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":856311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy two computers, two tables and two chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-03T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114744},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122055},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":124394},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":126778},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129208},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131685},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":134209},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136781},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":139403},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142074},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":144798},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":153871}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.97},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.54,"local_amount":114744,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":114758.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803765},{"amount":68.66,"local_amount":122055,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":122070.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614835},{"amount":69.97,"local_amount":124394,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-22T08:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":124409.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568790},{"amount":71.31,"local_amount":126778,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":126793.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780114},{"amount":72.68,"local_amount":129208,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":129224.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188508},{"amount":74.08,"local_amount":131685,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":131701.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324725},{"amount":75.49,"local_amount":134209,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":134225.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038782},{"amount":76.94,"local_amount":136781,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":136798.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650943},{"amount":78.41,"local_amount":139403,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":139420.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140548},{"amount":247.92,"local_amount":440743,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":440798.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100478}],"funded_date":"2011-09-04T17:49:16Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":334403,"name":"Rodelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodelyn is 31 years old and married with two children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

In order to do so, she would like to borrow money from TYM Fund.  Her husband, Ngo Dinh Thoa, a security officer, also gives her a lot of support.  According to him, TYM Fund does not only lend people money but also teaches them how to use the money wisely and helps them increase social knowledge.  Having been a TYM member for 10 years, he knows that what he believes is right.  Now total income of both T. and Thoa is $130 per month, which is a big improvement compared to theirs before joininng TYM.  Their sons, one is 15 and the other is 12 years old, also help their mother with the store during their free time.  She is looking forward to borrow $575 to expand the store and increase the number of goods sold everyday.    \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nM\u1eb7c d\u00f9 l\u00e0m 5 s\u00e0o ru\u1ed9ng, 5 s\u00e0o c\u00e2y \u0103n qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 m\u1ed9t ao c\u00e1, ch\u1ecb \u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ecb Th\u1ecbnh, 33 tu\u1ed5i, v\u1eabn quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh m\u1edf th\u00eam m\u1ed9t c\u1eeda h\u00e0ng t\u1ea1p h\u00f3a. \u0110\u1ec3 c\u00f3 ti\u1ec1n mua h\u00e0ng ch\u1ecb tham gia vay v\u1ed1n Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng.

I now sell not only women\u2019s clothing, but also men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing and also clothing for special occasions. I also sell phone cards. I now have a good number of people who order things from me. Because of this, I have had to hire two people in order to distribute the orders and tend to my store, since I have to go to the capital to buy. <p>Through much hard work, I have been able to buy the store that I used to rent.

She started her business 21 years ago selling cassava flour, yams, and corn.  Currently, she makes her own cheese, and she buys soybeans and cassava at the Dantokpa Marketplace.  Before Kiva loans, she bought at the retail level, but thanks the loan, she can buy wholesale.  Her loan will enable her to reserve her income for covering schooling costs.

It is located in the San Pedro de Quinego parrish, Nonad\u00e9 community, Rosas sector.  In their temple they worship an effigy of Christ Crucified.  It is very visited and well known as the Lord of the Miracles.  In this parish, the fighters were celebrities.  During Carnaval, they held the games of Pucara, which means strength.  The fight was between two rivals, who were generally very strong, but short indigenous people.  They had metal weapons, which they threw at their opponent.  They defended themselves by wearing a leather hat with large flaps, which they lowered to protect their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe members and the current coordinator of the Espoir Foundation, who was making a supervisory visit, are in the photo.  \r\n\r\nThe community\u2019s inhabitants work in agriculture, raise animals, and weave panama hats.  The people are hard working and responsible, as you will see in the examples of this group:\r\n\r\nCarmen Leonor S. C.\r\nCamren is from Quingeo.  She is 38, divorced, and has two children ages 14 and 10.  The 10 year old goes to the Rumipamba school, which is located in Quingeo.  The older helps her mother with the daily work and household chores.  She lives in her parents\u2019 house together with her siblings.  Even though they are grown and married, they still live with their parents.  Carmen, with her lack of education, says that there is nothing else for her to do but work in the fields.  She has not found other work.  She does more than farming.  She weaves hats, and after two or three days she finishes them.  Then she sells them in her own neighborhood for $12 or $15 each, depending on the difficulty in making them.  She has chickens at her house.  She would like to sell them, but she has very few.  She has asked for a loan for $440 to buy more chickens.  That way she could work more at home and not have to leave to work in the fields.  Her goals are to be able to become independent, build her own home, and be able to set up her chicken business there.\r\n\r\nEva Beatriz S. C.\r\nEva has been a member of the ESPOIR Foundation for a long time.  This is her third loan.  She is 27, single, and has a 7 month old daughter.  She lives with her siblings.  Even though they are older than she is, they continue living with their parents.  Due to her lack of education, she says that there is nothing else for her to do but work in the fields.  She has not found other work.  She does more than farming.  She weaves hats, and after two or three days, depending on how she makes them, she finishes them.  Then she sells them in her own neighborhood for $12 or $15 each, depending on the difficulty in making them.  She has chickens at her house.  She would like to sell them, but she has very few.  She has asked for a loan for $330 to buy more chickens.  That way she could work more at home and not have to leave to work in the fields.  Her dream is to be able to be a big chicken farmer and to buy milking cows.  Milk sales are good in her sector, and her parents have good, grassy fields.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":396960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-30T18:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Severina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868331},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757527},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146621},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984766},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015439},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740445}],"funded_date":"2009-10-01T03:32:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":145153,"name":"Tomas Benjamin","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Tomas es chofer propietario, y esta inscrito en el sindicato 16 de julio, su negocio es sacrificado porque el tiene que trabajar desde las primeras horas de el dia hasta muy tarde, solo asi puede tener un ingreso significativo; su dia de descanso es el dia jueves, ese dia es su restriccion del centro de la ciudad o sea no puede entrar al centro de la ciudad, ese dia aprovecha para realizar la reparacion de su movilidad, su esposa se dedica a la venta de ropa  en la feria 16 de julio, de la populosa ciudad del El Alto.

She is 29 years old, married to Roger S., who is a tricycle driver, and also serves as one of the elected Barangay (village) Councilors. The couple is blessed with two young children who are 8 and 9 years old. Their common dream is to improve their business, be able to send their children to school and have them graduate with bachelor degrees, and to be able to buy a truck so that they can earn a good living for their family.\r\n\r\nEven before she married, Mary Grace already had a general store which helped her support her parents. When she got married, she knew that she had to earn more to continue helping her parents as well as help her husband provide for their family.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, to get additional capital, Mary Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could expand her business operations. With more capital to use, she is able to maintain a wider inventory for her general store, which effectively earns her a bigger monthly income, which is now averaging PHP 14,000 per month.\r\n\r\nMary Grace borrowed PHP 22,000 in her previous loan, which she used as additional working capital for her general store. Now that she has fully repaid that loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000 for her 17th loan to use as working capital for her general store so that she can offer a wider variety of goods to her regular customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":413223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She was able to run the business very well and at the same time take care of her three children.  That is what Nelly J., president of the group, tells us.  One of the things that pleases her about the business is the beauty trainings like how to take care of the skin, the body, hair, and other things.  She is a very enthusiastic member, and she shares all of the information with her colleagues.  She also helps them so that they can sell products and receive the benefits.\r\n\r\nNorma L. makes clothes.  She tells us that she has high seasons when she has to invest a lot in materials.  This does not discourage her, because she has her objective of creating her own shop to give work to other people.\r\n\r\nAnother member who makes clothes is the treasurer, Esperanza Baz\u00e1n.  She has a shop in partnership with a friend.  She says that you need to sacrifice in this work, but it has its rewards.  For a long time she could help her children in their education.

Elle connait, ainsi, bien la gestion de groupe, entreprenariat \u2026etc.  Les membres du r\u00e9seau sont extr\u00eamement d\u00e9vou\u00e9s et se rencontrent une fois par mois. Ainsi, apr\u00e8s des frais d\u2019adh\u00e9sion au groupement, chaque membre est tenu de cotiser mensuellement 200 FCFA pour une caisse de solidarit\u00e9.\nSouhaitant se financer, elles d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent  d\u2019adh\u00e9rer \u00e0  U-IMCEC. C\u2019est ainsi que,  leur r\u00e9seau se voit scinder en 19 sous groupes de 5 personnes  pour un meilleur profit des financements. Elles sollicitent pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois un pr\u00eat de 100 000 FCFA par membre,  soit 500 000 FCFA par sous groupe afin de d\u00e9velopper leurs diverses activit\u00e9s.\nCependant, les r\u00e8glements sont vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente assist\u00e9e par la tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re du groupe, Madame Coumba Seck, pendant leurs r\u00e9unions mensuelles et ces deux se chargent \u00e0 leur tour de rembourser U-IMCEC. Ce r\u00e9seau qui, dit la pr\u00e9sidente, n\u2019a qu\u2019un seul et noble objectif : combattre la pauvret\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9nages. Actuellement, le r\u00e9seau compte 19 sous groupes avec chacun une pr\u00e9sidente et une tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re.\nLe sous groupe Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b013 est dirig\u00e9 par Madame Khady N.. Elle commerce du ma\u00efs, riz et du gombo. M\u00e8re de 8 enfants, Madame Khady N. partage ce sous groupe avec Madame N\u00e9n\u00e9 D. vendeuses de poissons frais, Madame Fatou N.  vendeuse de poissons s\u00e9ch\u00e9s, Madame Fatou Y. qui vend des l\u00e9gumes, Omo et Madame Ndeye F. vendeuse de fruits et d\u2019arachide. ","en":"As its name suggests, the Femmes Commer\u00e7antes group (F.C.) is a network of businesswomen. It is based at Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, its current president. She got the idea of forming the network after receiving training from the NGO OXFAM at Thi\u00e8s. Thus she is knowledgeable  about group management, running a business, etc. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a collective fund.\r\n\r\nSeeking financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people to take better advantage of funding. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various business activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Mrs. Coumba Seck, during their monthly meetings. These two, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group has only one noble goal -- to fight family poverty. \r\n\r\nThe sub-group Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b013 is led by Ms. Khady N.. She sells corn, rice, and okra. Mother of eight children, she belongs to this sub-group which includes Ms. N\u00e9n\u00e9 D., who sells fresh fish; Ms. Fatou N., who sells dried fish; Ms. Fatou Y., who sells vegetables; and Ms. Ndeye F., who sells fruit and peanuts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robin Clochard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":518878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Develop their respective businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-06T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e9n\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nd\u00e9ye ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759343},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790862},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971295},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-23T09:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708571},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922615},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189123},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484551},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620796}],"funded_date":"2010-04-18T18:26:41Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robin Clochard","image":830278}},{"id":195087,"name":"Germ\u00e1n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Germ\u00e1n tiene   31 a\u00f1os de edad,  est\u00e1 casado con Vilma, tienen tres hijos de los cuales uno est\u00e1 en la escuela,la familia viven en casa propia.\nDesde  muy  joven  se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar arduamente  para  poder  llevar  un mejor  nivel  de  vida, se inici\u00f3 como  vendedor ambulante en una empresa con un t\u00edo de quien aprendi\u00f3 la profesi\u00f3n.

Last year she grew tired of sharing her earnings with salons that did not share her vision. She declared, \u201cI want do something innovative, fun and my own\u2026it is my turn.\u201d\n\nOne day, rather than just passing by the shabby hair salon, Georgia marched in and asked to buy the space. From this bold move, \u201cPretty Pretty Collective\u201d was born.\n\nIt is no secret that Georgia loves to create fantasy and imagery. She grew up in England and Canada, left home when she was 14, and has been styling and modeling ever since. Georgia\u2019s vision for \u201cPretty Pretty Collective\u201d is to create an imaginative venue where she can style clients during the day.\n\nIn addition to serving her own client base, Georgia will proudly rent out the space to five other stylists who share her passion and her vision. To help keep overhead costs low and to maximize the real estate, at night the space will transform into a setting for art shows and fundraisers featuring local artists and popular neighborhood vendors. She hopes to host a fundraiser for her son\u2019s school, which, like other schools across California, faces serious budget cuts.\n\nUpon purchasing the salon space last year, a friend referred her to the small business section in City Hall where she found Women\u2019s Initiative for Self Employment, and Opportunity Fund. Georgia will use this $10,000 loan from Opportunity Fund to become an authorized vendor of the Bumble and Bumble product lines and to purchase salon furniture.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":553394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Even though she and her partner are not married, they have two children as a result of their relationship.  For this reason, she has not been able to work outside of the home.  She receives a pension in the amount of 70,125 CRC, which is a very small amount for her to provide a decent quality of life for her children.  Five years ago, Elba looked for a way to supplement the family income so she decided to raise pigs.  She buys the animals when they are small so that she can fatten them. Elba raises them for a period of six months before selling them and starting the process over again.  Her business is located in an area behind her house that is well-suited for keeping her pigs.  She was able to construct a pig sty by reinvesting the profits from her previous sales.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Elba has a viable business that she can develop from her home.  She also has land on which she planted bananas and plantains.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nVictory learning Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

For the last 10 years she has worked selling yogurt. She was assisted by a cousin who taught her the craft, using milk as the principal ingredient. In the beginning, before she could make her product at home, she had to purchase milk from various people and dairies. As she saw that the cost of these purchases was very high, she decided to save her money to purchase a small milk cow. Over time, and through her the hard work caring for the animals, her cow had a calf, which increased her livestock population. Currently, she has three cows, which allow her to produce a greater quantity of yogurt and to increase her profit. Juana is very satisfied with what she has been able to accomplish; nevertheless, there are many more goals that she would like to reach.

With loans, she was able to buy more products to satisfy her customers' needs. She is a married woman with four children who help her with her business so she can go out shopping in the market. With this loan, she would like to establish a larger grocery store. She also does mobile sales in Managua, offering spices like cinnamon, cloves and chamomile. \r\n\r\nJusta Pastora is a single mother who lives with her two young children. They help her with her business, which is making brooms. She learned this activity from her parents and she has taught it to her children. She dreams of having a good workshop and giving her children a secondary education. She sells her products in Managua, Tipitapa and other departments in the region.\r\n\r\nDigna Marina sells corn products like p\u00ecnolillo\/pinol (a traditional sweet cornmeal and cacao-based drink), tortillas, tamales, etc. She brings them to various customers who buy in bulk. She makes these products at home with her five children, taking advantage of the family's manual labor capabilities. Her young children are in school and also help her with the business. Her husband works in a shoe shop and helps her with household costs. With this loan, she hopes to buy raw materials like corn, sugar and firewood for the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThey live in humble conditions, and came to work with Adim because of a regional advertisement. They like this way of operating because before they couldn't get guaranteed credit, but Adim gave them confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":327402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase spices and brooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-06-03T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justa Pastora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889228},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889229},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110554},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110555},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531989},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531990},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531991},{"amount":80.56,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963503},{"amount":80.52,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963504}],"funded_date":"2009-06-13T15:31:10Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:40:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":116403,"name":"Ronnie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronnie O. is from the village of Pigsag-an, Cagayan de Oro City.

Yadira competed in a haute couture competition at province level this year and she won first place.\r\n\r\nYadira has a small dressmaking workshop where she has been sewing all kinds of clothes (15th birthday dresses, bridal gowns, etc.) for many years.  However, she says that she loves making children's clothes.  She works on orders from individuals and also makes clothes for a store in the city center.  She works with the help of another person who she pays a monthly salary.\r\n\r\nYadira has been a member of her community bank for four years and she is very happy because it has helped her a lot.  She will use this new loan to buy fabric and other materials for her dressmaking business.  Her dreams are to have a bigger workshop in the city center where she can also sell her clothes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":661717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabric, thread, zippers, buttons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-12-10T21:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yadira Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683465},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422589},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841355},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283737},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151663}],"funded_date":"2010-12-12T10:38:13Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":260663,"name":"Ahmed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmed is a young man from Tulkarem, Ahmed and his brothers own a carpentry shop where they make furniture such as tables, chairs, beds, doors and windows. \r\n\r\nAhmed took a loan from the FATEN branch in Tulkarem (where he appears in the picture) to buy wood and make more furniture.

","en":"Martha Luz is 45 years old and lives in the city of Cartagena with her husband and three children who range in age from 4 to 14.  There she has a business called \u201cConfecciones Aldescu\u201d, which she started 10 years ago as a way to help support her household and cover some of the expenses since only her husband was contributing at the time.  Soon after her business was started, she began offering sewing services from her home.  Her business grew, but her customers did not provide her with the fabrics and supplies that she needed to make a particular dress, so she began producing at all costs and also started exhibiting dresses of different sizes.  Martha gradually acquired more merchandise such as cosmetics, lipsticks, perfumes, and other items so that she could increase her sales.  At the moment, she is taking advantage of the time of year when her sales rebound by stocking her business with products that she knows her customers will need.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason Martha is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy raw materials for making dresses, as well as perfumes, cosmetics, shoes, and other items in time for the Day of Love and Friendship (the Colombian equivalent to Valentine\u2019s Day).  Martha will take advantage of this time to make many sales.  Her dream is to have a larger space where she can relocate her workshop so that she can create jobs and position herself within the community.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":856369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sewing materials, perfumes, cosmetics, shoes, and other items.

From this income, Ni Nengah Nerti could meet her household needs, including education of her 2 children, and repair her simple home. Ni Nengah Nerti also sees an opportunity to expand her business, by being a red sugar distributor,  buying sugar from others, and resell it to a large vendor.

Dengan modal Rp. 700.000,- Ni Nengah Nerti dibantu suaminya memulai usaha pembuatan gula merah dengan memanfaatkan 15 pohon kelapa  yang ada di kebunnya.

Dari pendapatannya  inilah Ni Nengah Nerti memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya termasuk menyekolahkan ke dua anaknya dan memperbaiki keadaan rumahnya yang masih sangat sederhana. Ni Nengah Nerti juga melihat peluang untuk mengembangkan usahanya dengan menjadi pengepul gula merah yaitu dengan membeli gula dari orang lain dan kemudian  dijual lagi kepada pengusaha besar tapi karena keterbatasan modal yang dimiliki Ni Nengah Nerti tidak bisa leluasa mengembangkannya.
