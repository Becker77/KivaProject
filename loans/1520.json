Kavitha has been taking loans from the PAT and she is regular in her repayment of the loan on time. \n\nKavitha wants to buy a smokeless stove for her family. The stove is manufactured by Greenway Grameen Infra Pvt, Ltd. It costs INR 1400. It is more efficient than the traditional mud stove. Traditional stoves consume more time and money.

For them, \"Flor de Campo\" [Flower of the Field] is a way to express the freedom they feel because they live in a community surrounded by trees and hills. One of the attributes and benefits of the region is the cultivation and harvesting of coffee and sugarcane, which allows the inhabitants to make their living in these areas of business. The majority of the inhabitants plant coffee on their small pieces of land for their own consumption.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: Maria--grocery sales; Alejandro--sandal sales; Tomasa--grocery sales; Aurora--food sales; Paula--sweets sales; Juana--bread sales; Grisel--clothing sales; Tirso--watch repair; Minerva--snacks sales; Emma--snacks sales.\r\n\r\nTirso is a very hardworking person who has worked for the past 6 years at selling and repairing wrist watches and wall clocks. He also weeds yards and coffe farms. To do his work, his main tool is his lawn mower, which he uses to tidy the land. When he's done cutting the weeds, he rakes them and leaves things ready for planting. In this way he satisfies his customers, who seek him out because of his quality service. With his earnings, Tirsa provides for his household's expenses and covers each one of his loan payments on time. He explains that sometimes he works in the coffee harvest by picking the beans, which means another source of income for his family. He wants to use his loan this time to buy more wrist watches for men and women, and also more wall clocks.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Tirso is wearing a striped polo shirt.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1673636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy wrist watches and wall clocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Paraiso la reforma, Tezonapa,Ver.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-08-25T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-24T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Blanca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grisel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tirso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma Eloy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":656.26,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-09-17T17:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8567.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":530255717},{"amount":656.26,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8567.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690536},{"amount":984.36,"local_amount":12750,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12850.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561823516},{"amount":319.46,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4283.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.66,"payment_id":579807725}],"funded_date":"2014-08-25T21:35:14Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T16:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":756334,"name":"Marianne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marianne is 39 years old, married, and has four children.

She tells us she is 27 years old and has been married to Samuel for nine years. They have formed a family with two children, only one of whom is currently in school. Graciela has been raising and fattening sheep since she was 7 years old. She buys them when they are young, and with the earnings from their sales she helps out with the household and education expenses. \"I started the business because it was easier to raise young sheep than to go out to work; I don't like to leave my children alone without my care.\" \r\n\r\nGraciela is requesting a loan from VisionFund Mexico to buy more lambs because she doesn't have any right now. She recently sold all the ones she had to pay for her daughter's medical expenses because she suffered an accident. Because of the this, the little one is now better. Graciela says she has very good luck with this type of business because the sheep don't die on her, nor do they get sick. They grow very quickly and, also, she loves to raise animals.

With this new loan that he is asking for, he will invest in the purchase of products to sell in the cafeteria that he has with his wife in a school. He has had this business for some years. They began with a basket outside the school, and they have managed everything through the loans that they have requested and the efforts that they have made to have better administration.  Gilberto continues working in photography, also, but this business is sporadic, only when events come up or at the end of the year, for school graduations.

It consists of four women living in Sana'a, Yemen. They asked  for a loan of 170,000 YER from AMB. \r\n\r\nNadia is a 31-year-old widow, living in her own house which is uncompleted. She is the leader of the group. She works as a cleaner in the streets with a small salary, and she is very dynamic and vigorous. Her husband passed away several years ago. When he was alive, he and Nadia shared in accumulating an amount of money and built their own house on the land they purchased. That building cost them a lot of money. \r\n\r\nNadia's husband passed away before completing the building of the house. Now the house is not renovated from the inside and most of the rooms are without doors and windows.

It is composed of eight members and is headed by a board with Nelly as the President. The business that the members of the communal bank have are varied and among them are: food sales, fabric sales, tableware rentals, gift shops, beauty salon, chocolate sales, hardware sales, and car washing.\r\n\r\nThe loan they are taking out will benefit micro-entrepreneurs where Nelly is a member. She says that it is the first time that she has partnered with Pro Mujer,  joining through an invitation from a counselor who visited her home. Currently she has a tableware renting business. She tells us that she learned this business two years ago beginning with flower decoration of living rooms, and established the business with a little accumulated capital.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is taking out now is for an increase of capital (to buy tableware at wholesale) which she will buy from the wholesalers of the city of LaPaz and later she will add it to her service area. This type of work allows her to generate income to support her family financially, as she lives with a life partner.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she said that she likes the training the institution offers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1675348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy tableware at wholesale price","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-08-26T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-25T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16068,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1700.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1872.12},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1922.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1975.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2020.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2090.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2140.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2345.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":273.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":288.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":305.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":313.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":248.68,"local_amount":1700.32,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1718.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522427},{"amount":554.98,"local_amount":3794.64,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3834.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561656070},{"amount":1546.34,"local_amount":10573.04,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10685.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579575056}],"funded_date":"2014-09-24T15:41:15Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":756398,"name":"Lita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lita is from Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte.

They are requesting a loan of 200,000 YER (Yemen rials) from AMB.\r\n\r\nAmira is the leader of the group. She is a 26-year-old single woman. She has three sisters and six brothers, and is living with her family in their own house. She is an elementary student. Amira's father has a taxi and works on it as a driver. He also has two rented apartments inside his building. He is the sole breadwinner of the family. \r\n\r\nAmira is a very active and dynamic young woman. She wants to help her father with the expenses of her family, and she has a great motivation to learn the sewing. She thinks the sewing business is a suitable business for her.

She was guided in this by her mother-in-law, who is a merchant with a lot of experience. She learned this business activity in order to help with the expenses of her household, which is made up of her husband and her little 2-year-old daughter. Currently, the products she offers are jeans, sweaters, shirts, shoes, colognes and perfumes. She sells these items directly to her customers, through credit arrangements tailored to the payments each client can afford. Natalia works every day on her business, from 8 in the morning until 7 at night. Her steady customers are friends and those referred by them, and with these customers she has been able to sustain her business. Her goal for the future is to open up a shop to sell to the public, and eventually to buy an apartment. Her greatest challenge is to keep her customers loyal, so that she can expand her sales and build up her savings.

They find it is hard to depend on his income, as it depends on the availability of work. So Kalpana has been actively involved in cattle rearing.

Having an additional cow will provide her with a lot of practical benefits. She will be able to produce more milk and increase her sales volume. In the short run, she will be saving the returns to send her sons to a better school. In the long run, she will have saved enough money to go for better breeds of cows.

Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are all ages. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,185,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Mariatu requires a loan in order to buy additional ladies' dresses and children's clothing. She hopes that this loan will increase her stock and raise her income. In the future, Mariatu plans to educate her adopted children and build a house with the proceeds of the loan. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1675192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

Munira lives with her small child, mother-in-law and father-in-law in the Qubadiyon district. She learned how to resell almonds from her mother-in-law. Munira has been already involved in this business independently from two years. She buys almonds from nearby villages and then resells them at a market.

The group is composed of eight members and is led by a board of directors, of which Lidia is the President. Lidia became a member of Rosas Lindas four years ago, when she was invited to join Pro Mujer by a friend who is also a client. The members of Rosas Lindas run a variety of businesses, including: gift sales, cocoa sales, corner market, furniture sales, carpentry, bakery and cosmetic sales. The loan that they will receive will benefit microentrepreneurs like Lidia.  Lidia is the owner of the gift business, a trade she learned from her parents who have the same sort of business.\r\n\r\nLidia requests this loan to increase her working capital, namely, to purchase domestic appliances on wholesale through the markets in El Alto. She will then decorate the appliances to sell them in her shop. This business allows Lidia to generate sufficient resources to support her family (she is married and has three children). When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Lidia said that she likes the training offered by the institution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":1675427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase domestic appliances on wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-08-26T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-25T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesusa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yola\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marielena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizeth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20076,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3144.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3298.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3388.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3479.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3553.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":480.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":507.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":517.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925.98,"local_amount":6355.53,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6398.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542522431},{"amount":480.58,"local_amount":3298.48,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561656074},{"amount":493.67,"local_amount":3388.36,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3411.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579575060},{"amount":1024.77,"local_amount":7033.63,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7081.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168891}],"funded_date":"2014-09-05T02:47:13Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:03:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":754608,"name":"Telma Seleyma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Telma de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con sus 2 hijos de 6 y 3 a\u00f1os de edad y su esposo.\nTelma  se dedica al negocio de pupusas desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, ya que sus padres no pudieron darle su estudio.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a CREDICAMPO,  es para comprar sillas y mesas para que los clientes coman alli mismo las deliciosas pupusas. \n\n Telma en un futuro se ve con un puesto de pupusas muy amplio y con mucha demanda  y un buen servicio al cliente y as\u00ed obtener mejores ingresos  para darle una buena educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos para que sean personas de bien en el futuro.","en":"Telma is 33 years old and lives with her husband and two children, ages 6 and 3.

14 years with a company Lara had loved and respected as well as having managed a consistently successful office and top recruiters in the company year after year, Lara found that she was unable to manage and lead her office and staff the way they wanted her to, so she knew it was time to leave.  \r\n\r\nShe never had a doubt that she was ready and could be successful and she was excited to start her own company and to give the opportunity she had enjoyed so much to others by creating a company that she would want to work for that valued hard work and mutual respect among all of the contributors and an environment where recruiters had the support and tools to be successful as well as the freedom and autonomy to do what they do best.  Lara loves what she does and she loves sharing the opportunity with others and touching the lives of so many people out there looking for their next job and career.  \r\n\r\nShe works with all types of companies and people to make employment matches and help others grow their business and develop their careers.  It\u2019s hard work, challenging, exciting, and very rewarding.   \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenges have been that everything comes from Lara. All of the corporate and administrative work is done by her; she does all of the accounting and negotiating and working with vendors, payroll, advertising, and HR; she doesn\u2019t have a corporate office to handle any of that. It\u2019s all her, but she loves that side of it as well.  It\u2019s been exciting and she has learned so much and learns more every day.  \r\n\r\nGrowing the business is a challenge, hiring takes money, and managing the company\u2019s cash flow has challenges at times.  Lara is using the Kiva loan to hire, and this hire will increase the company\u2019s revenue and cash flow for more hiring and growth in the very near future!  Lara hopes to see Aym Alliance continue to grow and she has no limits in mind!  She hopes Aym Alliance is a place where people love to work and find a home where they can reach their goals in their careers and that she continues to help client companies and client candidates grow their businesses and develop their careers as well!

Since then, she has started a new business sewing women's dresses to order and she is very satisfied with the work she does.  But there is one problem related to Parvina's work that bothers her - it's her sewing machine.  Her machine has become old and it often gets in the way of her working process.

The loan will be used for increasing the number of piglets, renovate the barns, and purchase superior feed. The group still needs a loan until they have enough capital to run the businesses by themselves. Now they already have been saving and using it for capital.\r\n\r\nNi Made and the members of Tegal Badeng Indah group feel happy to receive support from lenders, Kiva, and MUK.

","en":"Carmen lives in a municipality close to the city of Barranquilla, with her husband and their three children who are 12, 13 and 17 years old. Her husband, owning a motorbike and seeing the need for constant maintenance of these vehicles, decided in 2010 to sell it and take advantage of the opportunity to sell parts for motorbikes. Carmen took over, and so generates an additional income for their home.\r\n\r\nThe main items she offers in the spare parts business are light bulbs, chains, tires and accessories, which they have added to their business little by little. Their sales are by cash or credit, every day from 8 in the morning until 8 in the evening, buying from warehouse suppliers in the city.\r\n\r\nHer aim going forward is to have a store to offer many more items associated with motor vehicles, and to see her children study a profession, so her greatest challenge is to maintain high sales in her business.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy  breakdown kits, chains, cable locks, tyres and other spare parts that are in high demand in her business. With this investment her business will improve as she will have a very good inventory which will lead to increased sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1675469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy breakdown kits, chains, cable locks, tyres and other spare parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sabanalarga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-08-26T18:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-25T18:40:07Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":83.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87839},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95068},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97682},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100368},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":103128},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105964},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108878},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111872},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114949},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124252}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.1,"local_amount":87839,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":90745.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518328},{"amount":50.02,"local_amount":95068,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":98213.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.04,"payment_id":562430954},{"amount":46.16,"local_amount":97682,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100913.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.33,"payment_id":579566681},{"amount":47.01,"local_amount":100368,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":103688.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.95,"payment_id":595164196},{"amount":48.21,"local_amount":103128,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":106539.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.27,"payment_id":611789106},{"amount":45.13,"local_amount":105964,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":109469.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.9,"payment_id":624849315},{"amount":49.37,"local_amount":108878,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":112480.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.26,"payment_id":636603397},{"amount":53.18,"local_amount":111872,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":115573.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.08,"payment_id":649571626},{"amount":51.41,"local_amount":114949,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":118751.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.54,"payment_id":666497001},{"amount":52.59,"local_amount":124252,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":128362.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.45,"payment_id":681350123}],"funded_date":"2014-09-22T12:57:31Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:53:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharine Urwin","image":1602057}},{"id":756899,"name":"Everlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everlyn is a hardworking entrepreneur who has been selling veterinary products in the Philippines for three years now.

village customers, including 9 CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. Currently, this community is having difficulties with drought. Mostly, they have to rely on rain water for their animals and home. Water supply from the well is not enough for the entire village. This year, due to the weather inconsistency, villagers' yields of popular crops such as sesame and green gram are lower than expected.<br \/><br \/>This new loan would enable this community to invest in raising and selling livestock, such as pigs. Villagers prefer to raise pigs and sell them back for profit. One small pig is about $50 and can be sold back at $120 after raising it for about one year. This profit would help them buy farming inputs, such as seeds or fertilizer, or support family expenses, such as health emergencies and school fees.  Livestock is their second source of income after farming for these villagers and is less reliant on weather.  For additional income, villagers will operate small grocery stores and send their children to the cities to work in ports.<br \/><br \/>Pictured above are the committee members from the village CBO: U San, U Kyaw, U Aung  (leader), U Win , U Zaw , U Chit, U Hla, U Kyaw Kyar, and  U Khin. Included in the photo is U Aung (third from the left), the 61-year-old father of one child. His main business is cultivating paddy, millet and sunflowers. As his son is a university student, he has to support his educational expenses. This new loan would help him to purchase two small pigs to raise and sell back for profit. He will use some parts of the loan to buy high quality seeds."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6075,"image":{"id":1668022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to help 31 villagers raise and sell livestock, such as pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Pakokku","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2014-08-26T19:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-25T19:20:08Z","loan_amount":6075,"lender_count":228,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shwe Su Village ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":5900000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":6075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":6075,"local_amount":5900000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T11:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5917051.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752394}],"funded_date":"2014-08-28T22:13:16Z","paid_date":"2015-02-21T11:15:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":756954,"name":"Khalida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalida is 37; living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a plumber; he has been providing services for many years and fulfilling all the expenses of his family alone.

has 27 village customers, including 4 CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. Farmers usually grow groundnuts, sesame, millet, and pigeon peas. As most of them are Buddhists, the village must save for regular cultural ceremonies, such as offering provisions to monks.  Additionally, access to finance is limited in this region, as the country's largest provider, the state-owned agricultural bank, is not active in this region.\r\n\r\nThe new loan would enable borrowers to purchase pesticides and vitamins in order to produce high quality crops. They usually have to spend about 40 USD to buy the pesticides and vitamins needed for one acre. They also raise cows to help on their farms, and goats to resell for a profit. With profits from these income-generating activities, villagers hope to address the community's social issues, such as providing access to cheap clean water, as buying water to drink costs about 3 USD a week, and buying a solar light to utilize at night, as there is no electricity supply in the village.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Kyar Kan Taltike Village CBO: U Myo, U Aye, U Yin, and Daw S.

As the area is suffering from uncommon rainfall and a lack of water in the community water basin, crop yields are lower than expected and households must buy drinking water, costing them about $3 a week.  The largely Buddhist community is also raising money to renovate the monastery and pagoda in the village.\r\n\r\nThe new loan will help these borrowers raise livestock, which is the secondary income source after farming crops such as millet and green gram.  Villagers would like to use this loan to buy pigs and goats. Some people who have chicken farms can also invest their loan to expand their business, as the upfront costs are very high.  There are other income generating businesses in the village, such as tapping toddy palm, selling groceries, tailoring at home, and seeking formal employment in urban centers. \r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Tat Won (S) CBO: U Aye, U Khine, U Zaw, U Aung, and Daw Mya. Included in the photo is U Khine, who is a thirty-two-year-old farmer.  With his new loan, he will purchase crop seeds such as sesame and groundnuts. As he is also planning to start a chicken farm, part of his loan will be used to buy chicken feed, which sells for about $40 a bag.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6025,"image":{"id":1672997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to help 30 villagers to raise pigs, goats, and chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Magway","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2014-08-26T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-25T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":6025,"lender_count":187,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tet Wun (South)","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":5850000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5850000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":6025,"local_amount":5850000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-25T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5868351.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626234116}],"funded_date":"2014-09-02T16:10:27Z","paid_date":"2015-03-25T09:59:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":756961,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a single woman.

The condition of his house is not up to the mark for living. He would like to reconstruct his house but he needs to save enough money to do so. This is why he needs to earn more.\r\n\r\nAnwer has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so her husband can increase the inventory on daily basis and consequently save more as well.

Meet Zipporah, a mother of two lovely children and a very hard-working woman. She is based in Gesoni, a remote village in the rich Kisii highlands, an area with fertile soils and famous for banana growing. Their staple food is \u201cmatoke,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from banana. \r\n\r\nZipporah has been practicing mixed farming for the past four years.  Selling eggs and milk has earned her a decent income. She also engages in another business to make ends meet. Zipporah passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nZipporah is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. Through the loan she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1675730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-26T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-25T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zipporah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3916.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4669.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4744.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4914.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5004.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5139.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5366.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5588.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5718.99},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5883.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6031.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.58,"local_amount":9431.84,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":9670.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547670},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":4588.89,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4705.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680671},{"amount":58.36,"local_amount":5022.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5150.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624956},{"amount":56.71,"local_amount":4881.25,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5004.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194036},{"amount":58.44,"local_amount":5029.72,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5157.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261943},{"amount":126.68,"local_amount":10903.4,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11179.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264064},{"amount":180.37,"local_amount":15547.42,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":15941.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":665458812},{"amount":77.12,"local_amount":6994.7,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7171.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.15,"payment_id":696586911}],"funded_date":"2014-08-26T23:47:06Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":756978,"name":"Nabeela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nabeela\u2019s husband has been driving an auto-rickshaw and pays a daily sum because this rickshaw does not belong to him.

For this village, rainfall is uncommon, which threatens crop yields.  Additionally, as the community well is not functioning properly, villagers have to pay about $3 for water each week.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will help the community purchase a small tractor, which costs about $7,000. In addition to expediting the planting and harvesting processes, owning a tractor will reduce villagers' current expenses, such as renting tractors from nearby villagers, leasing bulls from neighbors, and buying animal feed for these animals.  Some parts of the loan will be used to raise livestock, such as goats or pigs, which provide natural manures to replace expensive chemical fertilizers and can be resold for a profit. In the future, villagers also want to set up an ice machine and drink business to generate extra income for their families. \r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Tat Won (North) village CBO: U Tun, U Hla, U Tin, U Aung, and Daw Aye. Included in the photo (third from the left) is U Tun, who is a 36-year-old father of one child. His new loan will help him raise livestock. Sometimes, he also works as a mechanic and sells livestock feed to other villages. With his additional income, he wants to purchase a handset phone, which will help him speak with his customers and monitor market prices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5925,"image":{"id":1673003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones","Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to help 29 villagers buy a small tractor for village use.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MM","country":"Myanmar (Burma)","town":"Magway","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22 98","type":"point"}},"partner_id":416,"posted_date":"2014-08-26T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-25T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":186,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tet Wun (North)","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MMK","disbursal_amount":5750000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5925,"local_amount":5750000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-25T09:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5770951.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626234115}],"funded_date":"2014-08-27T21:48:09Z","paid_date":"2015-03-25T09:59:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":756786,"name":"Ana Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad y habita en casa propia junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida y su hijo de 12 a\u00f1os de edad quien se encuentra estudiando.
