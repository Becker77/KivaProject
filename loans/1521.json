The area is mainly covered with sand soil.  Thus, farmers have to rely on expensive fertilizers and compost in order to get high quality crops. Fortunately, the weather is also fine for this year and thus farmers only have to provide enough nutrients and manure for crop production. As most of them are Buddhists, the village must save for regular cultural ceremonies, such as offering provisions to monks. \r\n\r\nThe new loan will help borrowers purchase fertilizer and compost to improve the farms' soil conditions.  As livestock is their secondary income source, villagers raise cows, goats, pigs and chickens at their homes. For next season, the new loan would be invested to buy farming inputs and high-quality seeds such as groundnuts and mung beans. \r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Nat Ywar Village CBO: U Hla, U Kyaw, and Daw Aye. Included in the photo (farthest to the right) is U Hla, a 38-year-old father of two daughters. His children are studying at the primary school in the village.

He feels that most of its parts are out of order, so he is unable to generate any amount of income. \r\n\r\nHe wants to buy a new auto rickshaw.

area of Kenya. For the past six years, she has been engaged in mixed farming: selling milk and growing tea and a variety of food crops. Although this humble mother has been making profit through selling crops, she has been having poor harvests because of lack of proper farm implements. She is seeking a loan of 20,000 Kenyan shillings to buy good farm implements. Through the loan, she will double her production because she will buy good quality fertilizer and good seeds. Modern farming practices entail using good fertilizer and good seeds to reap more harvest, and Pauline is on the right track. Profits from an increased harvest will be used to repay the loan and improve her living

As they have a big family, it is very difficult for them to meet their daily expenses.  Due to regular driving, the taxi needs to be repaired so that it drives smoothly. As the entire family depends on this single source of income, its proper maintenance is very necessary.

Meet Rose, a mother of one lovely daughter who is 8 years. Rose is based in Tambalal, a remote village in Litein area of Kenya popular for tea farming. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past 4 years and she has made great strides in terms of profit margins. This small scale farmer generates income through selling milk, tea and some personal business that she does, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it. She passionately loves poultry farming and the best part is when she wakes up every morning to collect eggs. The main challenge facing Rose is the constant perennial shortages of eggs and poultry products in her village and local market. She seeks to change this through borrowing a loan and buying more poultry. \r\n\r\nRose is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. With the loan, Rose will increase her income through selling eggs, poultry meat and also poultry feathers. The demand for poultry products in Litein area is very high and through the loan she will be able to satisfy the demand. Other than profits from poultry farming, she will also benefit from poultry manure, hence saving money that would have been used in purchasing fertilizers. The additional income from this expansion will permanently change her life and improve her living

Meet Nancy who is 30 years of age, very hardworking, and a dedicated and honest farmer. She hails from Endebes, a remote rural area in Kitale. She is happily married and blessed with three lovely and adorable children. She practices mixed farming and has been doing it for the past three years and she has never looked back. Her primary source of income has been eggs, milk and crop farming. She also owns a motorbike that she uses for transportation of farm produce to the market. When asked what she enjoyed most, she said \u201cpoultry farming.\u201d The Kitale area is a very populated region, and demand for poultry and poultry products is high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable and fulfilling, but the biggest challenge she faces is meeting the demands. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry, so that she can be able to satisfy the demand for eggs from her neighbors and the local market. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture, and the demand for chicken is always high because it is such a popular meal for many people.\r\n\r\nWith the loan Nancy will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high resistance to diseases and have high productivity.  This will assure her of high profit margins. Through your loan, you will be investing in an aspiring woman who wants to increase her poultry farming and sell to other towns and in the near future increase to neighboring countries. Increased profits will be used to pay back the loan and get out of the poverty bracket that she is in right now.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1675939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She offers many items such as rice, flour, pulses (peas and beans), sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap and biscuits. \r\n\r\nShe has been running this business for many years, and it is the major source of income for her family, because her husband's income is very poor. Now she wants to grow her business because of an increase in her family's needs. Shazia decided to contact Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, for receiving a loan.

He lives in the town of Puerto Salgar.\r\n\r\nHe works spectacularly in the kitchen, because his business is making food on request: tamales, chorizo, empanadas, traditional Colombian dishes, and other food.  Carlos sells these dishes mainly to neighbors in the area who are familiar with his seasoning and who know they'll always get delicious, well-prepared food.\r\n\r\nCarlos wants to increase his food sales and improve his service.  He's requesting a loan to buy a grill as well as supplies and ingredients to keep on making his recipes.

There is a good market for milk in the neighboring trading centers. He hopes to  be able to earn enough income to educate his children through the university level.  With this loan, he believes his production will improve and so will his income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1675953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Meet Jane, a hardworking and dedicated mother of six lovely children from Chebuyo, a remote village in the Siongiroi area of Kenya. Her determination, self-drive and passion have seen her practice farming for the past 15 years. Being a small-scale mixed farmer, her primary source of income is milk sales, crops and some personal business that she does to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what she enjoys most, her reply was \u201cselling milk and feeding my dairy cows\u201d. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mother makes profit through selling milk, she is faced with one big challenge: lack of a dairy unit. She is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Dairy cows require a proper dairy unit, where they can comfortably rest and feed so that they can produce the maximum amount of milk. Also, a dairy unit is used to protect animals from diseases that are caused by harsh weather conditions. Jane dreams of developing her milk-selling business into a large enterprise and keeping more dairy cows. With this loan, she will have no challenge milking and feeding her cows. Through financial solutions from Kiva lenders, she is going to achieve her dream and improve her living

hardworking man. He is 53, married, and has two children. He applied for a loan with Arvand for the first time when he learned it was possible to receive financial support. Otabek and his family live in a small village. He has a university education and has taught at a local school for 16 years. His wife does not have an education and takes care of their home and children. \r\n\r\nIn order to be able to buy food, Otabek has his own a grocery store. He earns a good income and his wife helps him by watching the store when he has to work at the school.

In spite of the competition, she has managed to maintain her clientele, offering variety and low prices for her customers. Her daily work begins very early, opening the doors of her business and offering a good service. One of her dreams is to be able to grow in her business and make certain improvements in her house. Nowadays Narcisa has managed to increase her income a little thanks to the loans that have been granted to her. For this reason, she is applying for new financing in order to invest in working capital to purchase products for household use such as rice, oil, candies, detergents, and frozen products, among other additional items, and in this way to offer new products to her customers, as well as improving her income. Narcisa is very grateful for the help that the Kiva investors offer to people of scarce resources and poor countries such as Nicaragua so that they can have a dignified means of work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1675542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

To provide her family with a decent living, Nelly is deeply engaged in mixed-faming. Her primary income sources are milk, tea and crops. She also holds a salary-paying job besides farm activities. \r\n\r\nNelly is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. The change from the purchase will go to purchasing dairy meal. The dairy cow obtained through your loan will produce an average of 10-15 litres of milk per day. This quantity is sustainable daily for both family consumption and sales. The proceeds from sales will take care of the loan repayment.\r\n\r\nOnce Nelly is done servicing the loan, the proceeds from the sales will take care of her family expenses which are soaring by the day due to inflation. Her mission is to continue to work hard to improve her income and keep providing her family with a better quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1676055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3288.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3921.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3983.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4127.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4202.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4315.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4506.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4553.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4693},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4802.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4940.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5064.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.04,"local_amount":8474.66,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8568.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547681},{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":4663.95,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4715.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680682},{"amount":57.76,"local_amount":5044.64,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194049},{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":5078.19,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5134.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823450},{"amount":69.73,"local_amount":6089.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261950},{"amount":125.38,"local_amount":10950.19,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":11071.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600219},{"amount":86.37,"local_amount":7890.17,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7977.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.98,"payment_id":681377087},{"amount":44.42,"local_amount":4208.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4255.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.77,"payment_id":711505154}],"funded_date":"2014-08-27T17:25:06Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":756800,"name":"Maria De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 48 a\u00f1os de edad habita en vivienda propia.

Here is Beatrice, a dedicated, hardworking and passionate farmer who is 26 years of age. She is based in the remote village of Chebuyo in the Siongiroi area. She is happily married to a very handsome man, and together they have been blessed with six children. \r\n<p>\r\nBeatrice\u2019s primary source of income comes from selling milk and eggs. For the past fifteen years she has been practicing mixed farming on her small piece of inherited land. There she keeps poultry and dairy cows. Since childhood she has loved taking care of cows and running a dairy, so she is well experienced in all farming skills. Of all the activities she is involved in she feels most proud of taking care of her cows and loves waking up to milk them every day.\r\n<p>\r\nThe biggest challenge Beatrice faces on her farm is the lack of a proper dairy shed where the cows can rest and eat properly before being milked. In the past she has had to spend money on treatments for her cows when they were affected by harsh weather conditions. For these reasons Beatrice is kindly requesting a 20,000 KES loan to build a dairy shed.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this investment in her cows, Beatrice will see them yield more milk. This will translate into a higher income, improved living conditions and a secure future for her school-going children. Her dream is to increase her herd, and through Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders she believes that her dream will come to pass.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1676124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Palm Kennel Shells are waste products from her oil processing which she is currently fighting with the disposal of the waste. Monica will use this byproduct from her oil processing and will not incur any fuel cost when she adopts the use of Elsa Stove hence she will save some money for her household. This stove is the product of a research project supported by the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States Science and Technology Programme and the European Union (EU)to eliminate both indoor and outdoor air pollution and to reduce deforestation.  The adoption and the use of the stove means end to cutting down of trees for fire wood and charcoal for cooking and heating water in their community. \r\n\r\nMonica is now applying for a loan of GHS 170.00 to purchase the improved stove to protect her family from indoor air pollution.

This is Fredie. He is the Head Teacher of Amka Classic School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Mutungo in Kampala with 544 students. Amka Classic School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining an Ultra water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase an Ultra water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nAmka Classic School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

This is Diana. She is the Head Teacher of Naguru Parents School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Naguru in Kampala with 600 students. Naguru Parents School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining an Ultra water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase an Ultra water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nNaguru Parents will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank.

He is a widower and he lives in Imperial with his family.  He has two marvelous children who are the most important thing in the world to him, and for whom he has fought since they were young to make them into good people.  Now that his children are older, they support Maciano unconditionally.  Despite the pain he has suffered from losing his beloved wife, he has learned how to move forwards.  For more than 4 years, he has worked as a bricklayer on construction sites, which is going well for him since he always does excellent work.  \r\n \r\nMaciano wants to bring better security to his children, and therefore he would be very grateful for a Kiva loan since it would enable him to construct a path around his house and a wall in the rear of the house.  These will improve the quality of life and well-being of his family.  This will allow him to continue to work hard for his family, and he wants to continue to enjoy spending time with his grandchildren for many years to come.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1676189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to construct a wall and a path for his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maciano Gilmor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":124.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":128.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":134.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":93.35,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":98.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542485279},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":114.95,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":121.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562396964},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":118.51,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":125.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579528211},{"amount":252.44,"local_amount":673.19,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":711.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595127582}],"funded_date":"2014-09-25T16:41:09Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:46:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Swett","image":null}},{"id":757303,"name":"Kenan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kenan lives in Hoima, Uganda.

He also engages in other businesses outside but related to farming to earn extra shillings.\r\n\r\nSimon is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. Like many farmers, he is only planning to keep single poultry: chickens. From the hens, he will be able to sell meat and eggs to the local hospitality industries.\r\n\r\nThe demand for chicken products in Kitale has never been higher. With your loan, Simon will be in a position to acquire several chickens and establish his mark in this lucrative space.\r\n\r\nHe stated that the money from the new venture will be dedicated to the education of his children.

She lives in a small rural village, and has dreamed of working in healthcare ever since she was young.  With the help of her parents, she was able to see her dreams to fruition and currently works as a nurse in a local hospital.  She and her husband do everything they can to provide for their children; in her free time away from the hospital, they raise cattle, selling their meat and milk to earn some extra money for the family.  Her husband also works in a local workshop to help make ends meet.  Their combined income allows them a modest standard of living, and they have trouble paying for many of the things they need.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nargiza is seeking to buy more cattle for fattening, and she's turned to Arvand for a loan to do so.  She would like to thank Arvand in advance for their help; help which will allow her family to have a better quality of life.

She has only a third grade education but she is a smart businesswoman who is proud of selling slippers, which she has done for four years. Her husband works as a construction worker and helps her support the family.\r\n\r\nHer group has learned many useful things in the various loan levels, such as how to keep their sales and expenses in a notebook, and how to separate personal money from business money. Using the advice from her Business Adviser, she grew her business dramatically. Her goal for this cycle is to buy more slippers to sell to customers. Another goal is to increase the net income of her business and create better living conditions for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1675998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Sabina is very positive about the prospect of her businesses. Sabina's most recent effort is to use the ELSA clean-cook stove, which was developed through the research of ACP Science and Technology Programme\/European Union to reduce deforestation and indoor and outdoor air pollution. Sabina has virgin pellets as a by-product from her oil processing as fuel for the stove; hence she will no longer spend long hours in the forest looking for firewood to cook for her family. A loan of 170 GHS will help Sabina to achieve this vision. She is pleased with her micro lenders for their kind support.

However, she is entrepreneurial.  Several years ago, with support from her family, she started a small pharmacy in her home because she had many years of experience and knowledge about drugs.  This combination was excellent for achieving growth in her business.\r\n\r\nWith rising drug prices, Antonia needs to have a new investment to grow her small pharmacy.  For that reason, she is a member of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cPaxixil\u201d.  Antonia is asking for a loan to invest in her pharmacy to purchase popular medicine and sundries that the customers in her community want, such as serums, syrups, vitamins, syringes, thermometers, cotton, alcohol, etc.\r\n\r\nAntonia sincerely believes that being a client of Friendship Bridge has been a wonderful experience that has allowed her to grow as a person and has enhanced her self-esteem.  She is a very grateful beneficiary of the Friendship Bridge Education Program that empowers poor or extremely poor women in Guatemala to become successful.\r\n\r\nWith empowerment, Antonia is open and has become a leader of the Paxixl Trust Bank.  She has motivated more than four women to get a first loan.  They too are extremely grateful to be able to acquire more knowledge that then helps them strengthen their businesses.  Eleven Paxixil Trust Bank members from Francisco El Alto in Southwestern Guatemala send their greetings to the Kiva investors who are providing the tools they need to eliminate poverty in their lives.

She anticipates increased sales during her town\u2019s festival season.\r\n\r\nSandra and the other members of the Virgen del Rosario Trust Bank have strengthened their businesses because they receive monthly education services from their Trust Bank Officer who provides beneficial information through the Friendship Bridge Education program.  This very beneficial information positively impacts their lives by helping them with accounting, budgeting, administration, and good customer service.

It is also the name of the village where they live. The determined ladies in the Trust Bank are seeking solutions to aliviate poverty in their lives by working hard and educating themselves.  The women are on their very first loan cycle! They have a variety of small businesses including sales of fruit and supplies as well as handicrafts.\r\n\r\nLucia is the President of the Trust Bank. She is 28 years of age and married with two children.  She was unable to access formal schooling as a child but intends to give her children an education so that they can enjoy lots of opportunities. Lucia has an orchard with \u201cJocote\u201d trees.  The Jocote is a popular fruit in Central America and the Caribbean. The fruit has a thin skin which is purple-red or yellow when ripe. The flesh is juicy and acidic and can be eaten fresh (ripe or unripe), squeezed for juice or preserved.  Lucia has two workers who help her in the orchard pruning the trees, picking the fruit and packing it in boxes to sell in a large market. She is requesting a loan that she will use to plant new trees, increase sales and generate more income.\r\n\r\nThe women in the Trust Bank \u201cTzunun\u00e1\u201d will benefit from the monthly educational seminars given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. They will learn how to effectively manage their loans with newly acquired knowledge about effective business practices (accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing, pricing). The ladies will also learn about hygiene, health and nutrition as well as self-esteem and violence against women. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. \r\n\r\nKIVA investors play an important role in the lives of Lucia and her friends in the Trust Bank by providing essential capital for the small loans.

She is committed to her three children and understands that education is an essential key to a brighter and more successful future.

They see themselves as empowered women eliminating poverty.\r\nAntonia is the Treasurer of the Trust Bank. She is 48 years of age, married and has three years of formal education. She has eight children, four of whom are in middle school. Antonia is keenly aware of the value of education and is motivated to seeing that each of her children completes school. Antonia has a handicraft and textile business. She is requesting a loan to buy beads, needles, thread and other supplies. Antonia feels that her sales will increase and the family will realize additional income.\r\nAll of the women in the Trust Bank have benefited from the monthly educational talks given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. They acquire essential knowledge about health, hygiene and nutrition, as well as self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. The women are anxious to learn how to manage their loans effectively, and so they are pleased to learn about business planning, budgeting, accounting, customer service, marketing and pricing. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the education and small loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it works well. \r\nIn providing capital for the small loans, Kiva investors are valued partners with Friendship Bridge for these women. We look forward to providing a follow-up report on Antonia and her friends in the Mujeres Lago San Jorge Trust Bank. Thank you, Kiva investors, from the women in the Trust Bank for your kindness in funding these essential loans!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1676554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

He has earned a living in a security company for three years.  His wife is a homemaker and he has three children, two of whom attend school.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in security out of necessity, but he also rents three rooms in his house.  He's requesting the loan to buy cement, sand, and cinder blocks to build more rooms and earn more income, because he thinks it's an easy way to earn money.  And because he has the opportunity for people to seek him out, in the future he might support himself exclusively on the rents.  His job is very risky because of the crime situation in his country and particularly the area where he lives.\r\n\r\nHis dreams for the future are to have his land completely constructed, to live comfortably with the rent income from his rooms, and for his children to be professionals and work in more secure jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1676202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Most of them live in traditional families in N'Goloko, a village in the Dogoni commune, Sikasso Circle, the third administrative district of Mali. They are working with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to be able to carry out their agricultural activities during the rainy season. This is their 5th loan from the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, and they have properly repaid their previous loans.\r\n\r\nSalif, standing on the right in the group picture, grows maize. He plans to use his loan to buy 8 50-kilo bags of fertiliser and 10 cans of herbicide of varying quality, and to pay the labourers needed to cultivate 1 hectare of land. After the harvest, the produce is sold for cash or credit in the village and in Sikasso, to a client\u00e8le made up of men and women. He expects to make an average profit of 160 000 francs per crop cycle. This profit will enable him to repay his part of the loan and its interest and to contribute to the family's daily expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1678014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fertiliser and to pay the labourers' wages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Goloko","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":217.63,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amidou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daouda N ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sidiki ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salif ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1607.37,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2015-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":901375.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":217.63,"payment_id":636515533}],"funded_date":"2014-09-25T23:31:31Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T15:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":757644,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edwin is from San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

Gulzar hopes that her husband will use the loan in positive way, so that these funds will help him to meet demand. With increased sales, the profits will automatically increase, and she will be able to save more for her family. Gulzar is very happy and thanks Kiva and its field partner, Brac

","en":"Sergei has had greenhouses and grown vegetables on his own piece of land in the village of Vodyanoye for 15 years. He has lived and worked in this village his whole life. He worked in the garden with his parents, and they helped him buy his house when he got married. Everything else he did on his own. He has developed quite a good business and has a decent income. At the moment he has three parcels of land, two owned by him and one by his wife. They have 12 large greenhouses on the land and two for seedlings. Everything is heated and covered with three layers of plastic film.

","en":"Sergei has big plans for his second harvest and hopes to double his revenue. He has been investing everything back in his business. He recently inherited a piece of land from his parents, who weren't working it anymore. It has two big greenhouses which he has spent time and money fixing up so that he can use them.\r\n\r\nThis year prices have risen and continue to rise, and therefore Sergei put all his money toward buying fertilizers and plastic film as well as helping his son and his sister, whose daughter got married. Seeds have gotten more expensive too and he now has the ability to buy good ones, so Sergei decided to turn to Kiva, so he can borrow some money and buy seeds both for this year and next year. The sum he needs for this is 15,000 grivens."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1675143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

The first 3 children already have their own families, and the last two are students in the school in their community. (Diego can be found first from the right in the orange coloured t-shirt).\r\n\r\nHe obtains his earnings through the production of bananas, an activity which he has been doing for 50 years. Diego has taken life's obstacles as a challenge in order to overcome his situation and things have gone well for him thanks to his father who taught him this work, which generates for him the earnings and income to be able to improve his family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nHe has become an exemplary leader in his community and it is because of this that a group of people have joined with Diego to together undertake banana production in order that they too can improve their living conditions in the future. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used for the maintenance of his banana crops because for him it is very important that the banana plantations which he counts upon yield better fruits, to then be able to open more fields and sell even more. One of his aspirations is that the plantation yields more banana plants in order to grow his production, and also to see that his children become professionals in the future. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":1676252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to maintain his banana crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Suchitep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diego","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baltazar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":17500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":469.74,"local_amount":3653.57,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3673.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579464005},{"amount":213.55,"local_amount":1660.95,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1669.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070752},{"amount":200.78,"local_amount":1561.6,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1569.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612113803},{"amount":65.7,"local_amount":510.98,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":513.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624777163},{"amount":450.91,"local_amount":3507.09,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134599},{"amount":206.46,"local_amount":1605.81,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1614.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489815},{"amount":642.86,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5026.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972375}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T20:26:48Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:14:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Thompson","image":1511903}},{"id":756730,"name":"Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 31 a\u00f1os de edad,  es padre de  2 hijos en las edades de 3 y 6 a\u00f1os. \u00c9l tiene 2 a\u00f1os de experiencia en la preparaci\u00f3n de comidas r\u00e1pidas, negocio que inici\u00f3 observando lo concurrido del sector, donde hoy esta ubicado, pues a su alrededor existen estaderos, discotecas, viviendas y con ello surgi\u00f3 la necesidad,  de dar respuesta a todos los que disfrutaban de actividades sociales en este sector.

He has been driving the auto rickshaw for many years using petrol, which is very costly. \r\n\r\nDue to the increase in the cost of petrol, Zahida's husband sold his old rickshaw and wants to buy a new CNG rickshaw. With the contribution of savings and the selling price of the old rickshaw, they are still short of the amount needed to buy a new CNG rickshaw. Therefore, Zahida contacted Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan. Through the loan amount her husband will buy a CNG rickshaw, so he can minimize fuel expenses and grow his income.\r\n\r\nZahida seems very happy after receiving this loan.

village customers, including three CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. This year, rainfall is erratic, threatening this season's harvest. Sesame is the main crop for this village. Additionally, access to credit is quite limited, as the country's largest provider, the state-owned agricultural bank, is not active in this region.  The village is quite small, as there are only about 80 households. They earn money mainly by farming and raising livestock. Although the village is small, it regularly celebrates Buddhist cultural ceremonies, such as offering provisions to the village's 40 monks. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will help this community purchase farming inputs, such as fertilizer and high-quality sesame seeds. Sesame grains are $60 and groundnut grains are $40 for one acre. The extra income will be used for household expenses and community development projects.  For example, villagers are raising funds to complete the construction of the village's primary school, which is in need of floors.   \r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the Kan Kyi Village CBO: U Tin, Daw Mar, and Daw Than. Included in the photo (first from the right) is U Tin, the father of three children. His children are still students.

Meet Carolyne, a 29-year-old farmer from a remote village in Kwanza, Kitale area. She resides with her 40-year-old husband with whom she is blessed with three boys and a beautiful daughter. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 10 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs and various varieties of food crop at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry, sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality which will translate to more income. Apart from increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that could have been spent in buying fertilizer. Your loan will bring joy to his family because she will be able to support her family and improve her living

She is married and is blessed with five children who she treasures and cherishes. She has been practicing mixed farming on her inherited small piece of land for the last 38 years. She is considered among the best farmers in her rural village because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, and she offers advice to young, upcoming farmers. \r\n\r\nHer primary source of income has been milk, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer hobby is milking Wanja and Njeri (the names of her dairy cows). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. \r\n\r\nProfits from selling milk will be used in repaying back fully the loan, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nNancy is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also start a selling dairy product such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1676758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T17:50:05Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":67600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4101.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4998.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5086.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5289.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5395.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5638.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5760.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5896.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6096.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6253.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6452.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6631.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.84,"local_amount":7661.74,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7756.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547685},{"amount":94.84,"local_amount":8272.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8374.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680686},{"amount":65.45,"local_amount":5709.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5779.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624972},{"amount":66.08,"local_amount":5763.63,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5834.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194057},{"amount":134.35,"local_amount":11719,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":11863.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261956},{"amount":322.22,"local_amount":28105.75,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":28451.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600225},{"amount":3.89,"local_amount":368.26,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":372.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"payment_id":711505158}],"funded_date":"2014-08-29T15:00:40Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:48:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":757391,"name":"Melvin Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Melvin, es propietario de una granja de gallinas ponedoras, su negocio lo estableci\u00f3 hace 3 a\u00f1os, para tener una fuente de ingresos con los que puede costear sus gastos personales y aportar en otros gastos del hogar; Melvin es soltero, no tiene hijos, actualmente vive con uno de sus hermanos. \nSe ve en la necesidad de solicitar capital para hacer mejoras en la infraestructura de la granja, esto le servir\u00e1 para tener en mejores condiciones a las gallinas y a aumentar la producci\u00f3n de huevos, espera mantener su negocio funcionando y lograr estabilizarse econ\u00f3micamente. \nSus proyectos son mejorar sus ingresos, cancelar sus deudas, de esta manera tener un patrimonio cuando llegue el momento de formar su propia familia.  \n\n","en":"Melvin is the owner of a farm of laying hens.
