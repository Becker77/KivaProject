","en":"Nadezhda has been involved in growing vegetables on her own plot of land in the Vodyanoye village for 14 years. Because Nadezhda's parents are from Vodyanoye, she too has been familiar with agriculture since childhood. She and her husband used to live in Energodar, both of them worked, but did not have enough money. Then, they sold their apartment and purchased a house in the Vodyanoye village. Nadezhda and her husband built greenhouses together and continue to develop their business. They have 4 heated greenhouses for tomatoes, 10 small ones for radishes and two greenhouses for seedlings. They installed another greenhouse this year and need to cover it.\r\n\r\nNadezhda hopes to install another greenhouse and needs 40 000 hryvnia for this purpose. Nadezhda has about a hectare of land, so she has space to grow her business. She wants to expand her business and build more greenhouses. In the meantime, they grow wheat for their animal husbandry business, but plan to build greenhouses there and expand more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3075,"image":{"id":1675151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to build a new greenhouse and expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1082.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nadezhda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1537.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000.87,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20107.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":536.63,"payment_id":682004330},{"amount":991.89,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-20T12:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":20107.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":545.61,"payment_id":697342864}],"funded_date":"2014-08-31T16:48:59Z","paid_date":"2015-08-20T12:14:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":757742,"name":"Mkombozi Mwenge Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Levina, who is in her late 20s, is married with two children who are still at school.

Meet Tarasila, a very hardworking mother who is 62 years of age. She is a small holder farmer from Mburi, a remote village in the fertile Kerugoya area of Kenya. This charming mother of five has been engaged in mixed farming for the past 41 years. She commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in her village. Her main source of income has been eggs, milk, tea, and a variety of food crops that she plants. \r\n\r\nTaking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kerugoya. Tarasila has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nAccessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Tarasila will achieve their dreams and goals. Tarasila believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan.

The group consists of eight members and is led by a board of directors, with Sandra as secretary. \n\nThe members of the communal bank run a variety of businesses, including selling stockings, selling underwear, providing transportation services, selling lubricants, selling clothes, selling food, and selling traditional Andean skirts.\n\nThe loan that the group will take out will benefit small micro-entrepreneurs, one of whom is Sandra. She says that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago and that she became a member at the invitation of an outreach officer from the institution who went to visit her at her home. Currently, Sandra has a business selling clothes; she mentions that she learned the business two years ago, with the first loan received through Pro Mujer.\n\nThe loan that she will take out now is to increase her capital to purchase clothes wholesale, which she will acquire from the wholesale vendors from the city of El Alto.

The group has eight members and is directed by a committee, whose president is Sintia.  The members of the association run various businesses, among these a bakery, and sales of clothing, food and groceries.  \n\nThe flood that took place in Guayaramerin affected many small businesses, since they lost much of their merchandise and tools of trade.  Sintia says that she joined Pro Mujer four years ago, invited by a friend who is a customer of the organization.  After the natural disaster struck her family, she decided to return to her work, since this was her own way to contribute financially.  Her business is selling clothing.  Sintia wants it known that she began this business three years ago in her home, first as a hobby, since she could talk with her girl friends ad sell things.  With time it became her means of financial support.  \n\nThe loan she is taking out now is to increase her capital goods  through a purchase of clothing wholesale.  She will buy from the wholesalers in the city of Santa Cruz and then sell the clothes in her business.  This form of work allows her to generate income to support her family since she lives with her partner and has two children.   When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Sintia answers that she likes the help  in rebuilding her business and the care for her  and  her family's health offered through the doctors' offices.

","en":"Alexander is 31 years old and lives in the Vodyanoye village. At one point in time, he worked at a nuclear plant, but the salary was low, and he decided to be exclusively involved in farming. He started with two greenhouses that he got from his wife's parents and grew tomatoes there. The business grew in 6 years, and they saved enough to buy a house. They bought a house last year and built 3 large greenhouses on their land and installed heating for them. This year, Alexander bought a more powerful boiler and moved the old one to his parents land. To-date, Alexander has been involved in growing vegetables on his own land for 10 years. He has five heated greenhouses. He works on plots of land - his and a second one given by his parents. Alexander primarily grows tomatoes and cucumbers.\r\n\r\nAlexander wants to use the sum of 30 000 hryvnia to buy fertilizers for the second crop, repair a greenhouse, buy plastic for greenhouses and pay a salary to his workers. With time, Alexander wants to expand his business and build more greenhouses. In the near future, he plans to build two additional greenhouses. Alexander is active, hardworking and loves to achieve everything on his own.

Meet Mary. She is a very humble smallholder farmer with big ambitions. She hails from a small village in Karumandi, which is in the central parts of Kenya. For the last 25 years, the mother of two has been doing mixed-farming on a small piece of land she owns. With time, she grew very passionate about dairy cattle farming and horticulture. For a living, she sells milk and tea among other varieties of crops and flowers from her farm. She also diversified into a small business that deals with offering transportation services. \r\nMary is seeking a loan for two things: to purchase a hybrid dairy cow and to construct a dairy shed. She loves raising cows. However, over the years the biggest challenge for farmers has been diseases. For this reason, most rural farmers would rather keep traditional breeds that are resistant despite being way less productive.  Traditional breed is simply not an option for progressive farmers like Mary. \r\nWith your loan, Mary is going to buy a high quality breed that is very productive.  To curb diseases, she is going to tighten her belt as far as dairy management in the farm is concerned.  An efficient management of cattle will be incomplete without a well-planned and adequate housing of cattle. The new durable cattle shed shall provide comfortable accommodation for the cattle with proper sanitation and good arrangement for the production of clean milk under convenient and economic conditions. The cattle will have constant access to feed and an abundant supply of fresh, clean water.\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo, rural farmers\u2019 microfinance, believes in innovation and transformation. We hope the cowshed will protect Mary\u2019s cattle from weather, improve hygiene and provide an environmentally efficient method of recycling stock effluent, saving her the cost of artificial fertilizer, money which she could use to educate her children.

He got a job at an open-air mechanic shop near one of Nairobi's informal settlements. As the days went by, he noticed that there were no toilets at his work site.

She has 3 children. For the last 7 years, she has been doing mixed farming. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, and other crops.\r\n\r\nShe states that she finds dairy goat farming and horticulture to be the most enjoyable farming activities. The biggest challenge, however, is the prevailing animal and crop diseases in the region.\r\n\r\nLydia is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements and some dairy goats. The additional goats will boost the milk production volume of her farm. The new farm implements will help Lydia till, plant, cultivate and harvest crops, significantly reducing the time she spends to accomplish farm tasks. In addition, it will decrease her need for farm workers. She will be able to use the money she would otherwise pay in salaries to purchase and maintain the farm equipment.\r\n\r\nAdditional income earned as a result of these developments will go to her children's education.

She enjoyed her work and feels the joy of serving her customers every day with varieties of seasonal vegetables including cabbage, mustard leaves, cauliflower, peas, beans, ginger, onions, etc. She is the featured borrower of the group, and is shown with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nBy engaging in this occupation, she supports her children and sends them to college. She never feels discouraged by the loss and profits she has made every day for the past 15 to 20 years, and continues to be self-reliant. She has been in this business since her husband passed away 15 years ago. Being a widow and jobless does not narrow her mind to raise her six children alone and give them education. She has been giving her best to educate her children despite the hardship she faced, and feels content with her life. \r\n\r\nThe village they dwell in does not have a public transport system. She carries the stock of vegetables in a sack on her back and walks to the main market for selling early in the morning. As soon as she finishes selling, she rushes home, spending her time to collect and prepare varieties of vegetables for the next day. There is no proper power supply in her village, which is the reason for availing the solar energy loan. With much difficulty, she used to arrange her vegetables in a candlelit room, since she had bad eyesight. After availing the loan, she can arrange her vegetables in the evening with better sight and prepare them to sell the next morning. She arranges the vegetables in small bundles and ties them together with equal portions so that they will be easier to sell in the market. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to WSDS for breaking the barrier between her bad eyesight in dim light and her business by lending the solar house lighting system. Now she comfortably arranges her vegetables after sunset.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1675748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a mini solar home lighting system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T20:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T20:00:14Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pachoicham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chekneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rengneikham","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunkanchim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kipneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roikholem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thanglenchim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Droirem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoitaknei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":121730,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":121730}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-02T20:17:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":757835,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is a single mother of three children and all her children go to school.

James has been able to sustain the livelihood of his family of two children for the last five years by selling milk, eggs, tea, and other crops produced from his farm.\r\n\r\nMany farmers are just like James in Kerugoya; they practice mixed farming. Most of their problems are with crop farming. They take too much time to accomplish their tasks. They also need a lot of effort and labour to plough and cultivate land. Machinery and equipment come in handy to reduce all sorts of costs. \r\nJames is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. Old or poor farm implements usually result in high costs and poor quality of work. This is a clear recipe for losses. \r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, he joined a group named Kabuit Elder in order to access Juhudi Kilimo\u2019s agricultural loans.

","en":"Gulmira is 52 years old, married and has a son. Gulmira has a secondary-specialized education. Her husband and son help her with the household. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry, farming and selling milk since 1996. Thanks to Gulmira's hard work, today her business has 3 dairy cows, 3 calves, 3 bulls, 30 sheep and 1 horse. Gulmira also grows potatoes, cereal crops and sainfoin. She also sells milk both from her cows and bought from neighbors. She sells about 50 liters of ecologically clean and delicious milk per day to city stores. Also, she sells clothing (stockings, socks, pantyhose, etc.) at a clothing market. All together Gulmira's business yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month. To further develop her business, Gulmira requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy dairy cows to increase milk volume. Gulmira plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding her business and goods turnover.

She is very responsible at her job and has kept it even when the government has changed. Catalina lives with her husband and is expecting a baby that will be arriving soon. They are both very excited and a couple of months ago started building a new small room in their house where the baby would sleep once he grows. Unfortunately, they did not made the right calculations and materials and money ran out before they finished. They have been saving to finish the room and request a credit to finish buying the materials needed. Catalina's husband is a farmer and they are not able to prove his income, so getting a credit only with her income is very expensive. Although the room is not needed immediately, Catalina and her husband know that once the baby gets here they will have to cover many expenses and will never get to finish the room.

is a young women from Totolapan, Morelos. She works as a seamstress 6 days a week from 8 am to 8pm. She loves her work and imagines one day creating her own clothes. Paula is really excited because after years of saving she bought a piece of land near her parents' house. She now wants to start building little by little but wants to do it right.  She wants to build a house that will last for years to come and maybe some place where she can have a family in the future. Paula has worked many years to be able to do this. She wants to be supervised and be sure that the first room she builds complies with all the safety and quality standards. Paula is asking for a credit to buy the necessary materials to begin construction. She cannot ask for a credit someplace else given that she works from her house through an informal job, so a proof of income is impossible to get. Paula will receive visits from Ecoblock's certified technicians as well as training. Paula is really excited about this opportunity and making her dream come

They have a variety of businesses, such as food sales, cosmetics sales and clothing sales. They are based out of the central market of Antigua, which is a central sales point in the area. They are eager to not only receive FNGs loans but also to learn more about business administration and financial literacy. \nOne outstanding member of this group is Liliana (second from left) who is the leader of the group and helps the business advisor with organizational tasks regarding payment meetings and educational sessions. \nLiliana is 37 years old and married with three children (ages 10, 14 and 15), who are enrolled in Primary and Middle School. She is a bilingual secretary, but prefers to work in her own business. Her husband is a male nurse in a laboratory in Antigua. They are a good team and both support their family economically and emotionally. \nHer business is the sale of tights and other beauty items in the central market of Antigua. She wants to invest her loan money in higher quality products due to her clients \u2018demand. She is currently counting on monthly sales of 8200 Guatemalan Quetzales with net earnings of 3280 Guatemalan Quetzales.

She is a 50-year-old trader who has been selling materials, African wax-prints, for 16 years. Victoria wants to continue to support her children so that they can continue with their studies up to university level. Victoria has a textile business and she buys materials, African wax-prints, at a wholesale price and sells to customers. \r\n\r\nShe has made tremendous improvement in her business and so have the other members. The majority of the ladies do not know how to read or write and so the training sessions are essential to their success as caretakers of their family members and business entrepreneurs. The training is given in the indigenous language of the women, often with pictures, and covers a variety of subjects including effective business management practices, nutritional and health tools, and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe seven women look forward to creating a brighter tomorrow as empowered women eliminating poverty.

They live in a small village, Gosairhat, in Jalpaiguri district.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is an activity suited only to those who love the earth as a mother and as a provider of future life - a good future full of hope for future generations. This is Tarapada's (Aduri's husband's) work. He plants potatoes, carrots, beans, and gourds. He does this activity in the locality where he lives, and he sells his products in the local markets. He chose this work because he inherited a good knowledge of vegetables from his father. Now, with the growing needs of the family, he needs to increase his cultivation. So he has decided to cultivate paddy: the much demanded crop in his region.\r\n\r\nSo Aduri has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS). She will use this loan to purchase paddy seeds as well as chemical and organic fertilizers so that her husband has a good harvest this year. Some of her biggest dreams are to build some rooms for the children and to provide them with adequate living conditions.

Her children are in different grades in primary and secondary school. They live in their own house in Khalaigram.\r\n\r\nAleya's husband strives hard to make a living. All his life, he has worked in agricultural pursuits growing different crops. He has worked in unity with his wife. With the profits obtained from their farming, they have managed to build their modest little house. First, he wants to get a good harvest from the land and continue to save up other earnings little by little to cover household expenses. Right now, the need that has arisen is the cultivation of a profitable crop as his present income is insufficient to cover all the expenses of his family. He decided to cultivate paddy but lacks the capital.\r\n\r\nAleya is requesting this loan from Kiva's partner Belghoria Janakalyan Samity (BJS) to buy fertilizers, paddy seeds, and herbicides. She wants to take advantage of the rainy season to obtain a good harvest with all the care and management possible to achieve her intended future earnings, which will allow her to meet the needs of the family.\r\n\r\nAleya thanks BJS and Kiva for their financial support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1677019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and fertilizers to grow paddy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-08-27T21:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-26T21:50:07Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aleya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-28T01:21:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":754190,"name":"Seang's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seang\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kompong Thom province in Cambodia.

Antonio community, which has begun to populate little by little. He has lived there all of his life. He attended elementary in the community school. He learned how to work in agriculture when he was 12 years old with his father when they harvested beans, maize, and coffee. In this way, he learned how to be a good man from an early age and earn an honest living. He puts effort into improving the lives of his wife and two kids, who are his reasons for living. \r\n\r\nThe community does not have any electricity because it is very far from the power network.

Cercle de SIKASSO (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali.) The women are collaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to carry out their farm work during the rainy season. They are on their sixth loan with the institution. The previous loans were indeed paid back.\r\n\r\nThe crop grown is rice, as is the case with Ms. DJENEBA (standing in the middle in the photo of this women\u2019s group BENKADI 2). With her loan, she intends to purchase two 50-kg sacks of fertilizer and two containers of herbicide and to pay the cost of plowing to maintain 0.5 hectare.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest, the produce is sold to a customer base composed of men and women paying with cash or credit in the village and in SIKASSO. She plans on making an average profit of 74,000 francs CFA per planting. This profit will enable her to pay back her loan with interest and also to help out her husband in covering day-to-day family expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1678163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for fertilizer, herbicides, and plowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Nielepebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-28T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-27T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maminata\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mafoune","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarah\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokiatou Y","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maminata \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":415000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":415000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":748.64,"local_amount":415000,"processed_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":419818.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.36,"payment_id":636515541}],"funded_date":"2014-09-26T00:20:36Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":758009,"name":"Renida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Renida is a married woman with three children.

Patrick, 34 years, is a mixed farmer from Kitale, a rural town in Kenya. He has been practicing mixed farming for the past two years. This hardworking father of six earns his livelihood through selling milk, crops and some personal business he engages in when the harvests are low. \r\n\r\nHe passionately loves poultry farming, and rearing chickens is his hobby. Every day he wakes up in the morning to collect eggs and feed his chickens, and he finds this very fulfilling. Neighbors have been flocking to his compound to buy eggs, and through word of mouth, news has spread like fire in the whole village that he has quality eggs. The demand is so high, he cannot fully satisfy it. He is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, he will be able to satisfy the demand, and this will translate to increased income level. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, Patrick believes that small-scale farmers like him will be able to benefit from financial solutions. Poultry meat is a very popular meal among many people in his village, and this translates to improved income and better living standards. Patrick will sell eggs for commercial purposes and for home consumption. Increased income will allow Patrick to provide nothing but the best for his family and improve his living conditions. Other than profits, he will benefit from poultry manure and poultry feathers, which will help improve his life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1677163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

It is one of the most populous in Guatemala. The population is Maya-Kich\u00e9, a proud and traditional indigenous culture. The economy of the area is based in agriculture, fishing and handicrafts. There are many commercial ventures as well.\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres Comerciantes\u201d or \u201cWomen in Commerce\u201d is located here. There are seven enthusiastic ladies in the group. Delfina is the President of the Trust Bank. She is 46 years old, married and has four years of formal education. Some years ago, she began a food-selling business that was soon transformed into a restaurant. Due to her hard work and what she has learned from the Friendship Bridge trainings, Delfina has been very successful. As she was unable to handle the workload in the restaurant by herself, she employed three women to help her. Each of them has their own families to support and so it is a wonderful \u201cwin-win\u201d situation for all of them! Delfina is requesting a loan to purchase essential items for the restaurant including an additional stove, pots and dishes. She will have enough to cater big and special events like birthdays and weddings.\r\nFriendship Bridge believes that the combination of small loans and education, called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d, is a combination that yields very positive results.  Delfina and the ladies in the \u201cMujeres Comerciantes\u201d Trust Bank meet each month with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who shares timely and useful information with the ladies on a variety of subjects like health, hygiene and nutrition as well as self-esteem and violence against women. The ladies learn about effective business management practices as well and gain essential knowledge about business planning, budgeting, accounting, customer service, marketing and pricing.\r\nEach of the ladies in the Trust Bank clearly envisions a future as an empowered woman eliminating poverty. The small loans and educational seminars are an effective pathway to this goal. Thank you, KIVA investors, for your kindness and generosity in providing capital for these

alegres, pero sobretodo muy amables quienes desde que escucharon hablar de KIVA se entusiasmaron y fueron muy accesibles al posar para tomar la fotograf\u00eda y aparecer en la p\u00e1gina. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque uno de los integrantes se dedica a vender sombreros en las comunidades. \nJosefina tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en uni\u00f3n libre desde hace cinco a\u00f1os con su Patricio, juntos han formado una familia con dos ni\u00f1os los cuales asisten a la escuela. Jose, como le dicen de cari\u00f1o, se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de chalecos desde hace 16 a\u00f1os, cuenta que la actividad la aprendi\u00f3 de su pap\u00e1: \u201cdesde que tengo uso de raz\u00f3n, mis padres siempre se han dedicado a la elaboraci\u00f3n de chalecos y para m\u00ed no fue nada complicado iniciar con mi propio negocio\u201d. Desde hace 16 a\u00f1os, Jose tiene su propio taller de costura donde elabora los chalecos, inici\u00f3 solo con una m\u00e1quina de coser y muy poquito material, pero ahora ya cuenta con tres maquinas y adem\u00e1s da empleo a otras personas. Afortunadamente, Jose tambi\u00e9n cuenta con clientes que compran pedidos para revender sus creaciones. \nCon su pr\u00e9stamo, Jose comprar\u00e1 tela, cierres e hilos que es el material principal de su producto, de esta manera atacar\u00e1 la \u00fanica dificultad que se le llega a presentar: falta de materia prima y dinero para surtir. Su sue\u00f1o es invertir cada vez m\u00e1s, tener m\u00e1s m\u00e1quinas y m\u00e1s empleados para tambi\u00e9n ayudarlos econ\u00f3micamente.  \nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son: Eduardo quien  invertir\u00e1 en videojuegos; Adilene y Candelaria, en su negocio de chalecos y Lauro, en la venta de sombreros. Todos ellos est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con KIVA y con VisionFund M\u00e9xico por sus pr\u00e9stamos porque es una oportunidad de mejorar los negocios.\n","en":"The \u201cEl Sombrero\u201d group is made up of five very happy persons, but above all they are very friendly.  When they heard of Kiva, they got excited and were very available to take the photograph and appear on the page.  They chose the group\u2019s name because one of the members sells hats in the local communities.\r\n\r\nJosephina is 42 years old and has been living in a common law marriage with Patricio for the past five years.  Together they formed a family with two children who attend school.\r\n\r\n\u201cJose,\u201d as they call her, has been making vests for 16 years.  She learned this from her father.  \u201cMy parents have been making vests as long as I can remember and it was not difficult for me to start my own business.\u201d  Jose has had her own workshop for 16 years, where she makes the vests.  She started with a single sewing machine and very little material, but now she has three machines and provides employments to others.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Jose also has customers who buy from her to resell her creations.  She will use the money from this loan to buy fabric, zippers, and thread, which are the main materials for her product.

He and his wife manage their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRonaldo runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Ronaldo\u2019s case, he is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since his stall is located in an urban poor public market, his business flourishes. He earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him expand the business, he is requesting for a PHP 10,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. He plans to add more pants or jeans and also used bags and footwear. If he can roll the profits from this loan, he can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, he can expand his business and boost his income.\r\n\r\nRonaldo hopes to have his own space for his business so that there is no need for him to rent. He dreams of expanding it for he desires to give his child a better future. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and were he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1677643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

Currently, he is rendering taxi service to local people for a living. His wife grows vegetables in four greenhouses. He is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT to buy bricks, an oven, foam, cement and sand in order to modify the greenhouse for winter.

She buys different items which she thinks are saleable, and then sells them at a small profit. Her products are glue, band-aids, batteries, ballpens and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy from her due to her low prices and the many options she offers. Aside from this, she runs a direct selling business for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional merchandise to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she increases her sales.\r\n\r\nGloria hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years. \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has a university degree and is a high school chemistry teacher. She also raises livestock in order to earn additional income for her family. She started out in animal husbandry in 2010 with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Zhazgul currently has two cows, one calf, two horses, and eight sheep. In order to expand her business, she applied for a loan with Bai-Tushum Bank for 50,000 som (KGS) to buy feed and hay. Winter is coming soon and the animals will stay in the barn, so Zhazgul will need to be able to provide all of the necessary conditions for their well-being. She plans to use the profits from the loan to invest in the continued expansion of her business and to purchase a plot of land to build a house for her son.

This is her sixth loan with BRAC Pakistan and her first with Kiva.\r\n \r\nHer son owns a recycling shop and deals with scrap iron, aluminum, plastic bottles, and other materials. He buys scrap goods and sells them to the recycling factories. Due to current household expenses, he does not have enough money to buy scrap goods. He also does not have scrap to sell to make more money. Therefore, Mukhtar has requested a loan for her son, so that he can buy scrap goods, establish his enterprise, and save some money to meet sudden needs or incidents.\r\n \r\nShe is very impressed with this honorable support and has expressed an interest in taking more loans after the payment of this loan.

She has been doing embroidery by her hands at home for many years to support her family. In fact, her husband remains sick most of the time and is unable to do a job. For the sake of her children, and to meet household expenses, she started embroidery at home. A supplier comes to her home and provides her all the raw materials for doing embroidery; she completed her tasks along her daughters over a wooden frame. She wants to sells her handmade embroidery directly into the market so that she can earn more profit for her family. She has become expert in her art, and wants to buy raw materials her own so that she can sell her handmade embroidery in her hometown.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Bushra has requested a loan to buy raw materials so she can do more embroidery dresses to sell, and can generate maximum income. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of five daughters and two sons.

A modern dairy unit will assist him to properly feed his cows and also be able to milk them properly. Through the loan his cows will not be affected by harsh weather conditions because they will have a comfortable place to stay.

She learned this business by herself. Since there was no mill in the community, she and her husband decided to put one in, and they have had great results, since they are in the middle of a village at the entrance to the canton where many people visit. Because of this she opened the store so the people who come to mill can buy their products. She mills two days a week on a schedule from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy some spare parts for the mill, since her husband is going out of the country and right now it is the only income she has to support the children.

Today, he boasts of the great strides he has made in dairy farming. This ambitious father of three earns his livelihood through selling milk, eggs and tea produced from his farm. He also does a transportation business with his motorbike to make extra income. \r\n\r\nAlthough he makes profits from dairy farming, he is faced with challenges that might put him down. Cows in his farm are affected by harsh weather conditions hence they become sick, and also he faces challenges of properly feeding and milking his cows. He is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Cows require a proper resting place and proper food so that they can produce the maximum amount of milk. Without a proper dairy unit cows will be affected with diseases and also they will not have a good place to rest and feed hence low production of milk. \r\n\r\nWesley feels relieved knowing that there are partners such as Kiva lenders who assist aspiring men such as himself to achieve their dreams. With your loan Wesley is  going to change his life permanently, and increased income from high milk production will be used in paying back  the loan fully and improving his living

Ever since she was a child, she has lived surrounded by animals for fattening, because this was one of the only options to generate income for her household.  Maria Isabel is a member of one of the communal banks working with Fundacion Mujer.  Previously, she requested an individual loan for 600,000 Costa Rican colones, which she paid off on time, although the amount she requested previously was not as large as sum as she is currently requesting.  She needs this larger sum to invest again in her business, buying bulls to keep in the corral that she built 2 months ago.  She and her partner have 6 years of experience in this line of work.  In recent years, with the experience she has acquired keeping bulls of varying weights, she's been able to sell between 8 and 12 bulls a year in the auction in her area.\r\n\r\nIsabel will buy bulls between 350 and 400 kilos in weight, so that she can later sell them at a weight between 700-750 kilos in the Coto Brus cattle auction that takes place every Thursday.
