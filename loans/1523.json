Previously, she requested an individual loan for 600,000 Costa Rican colones, which she paid off on time, although the amount she requested previously was not as large as sum as she is currently requesting.  She needs this larger sum to invest again in her business, buying bulls to keep in the corral that she built 2 months ago.  She and her partner have 6 years of experience in this line of work.  In recent years, with the experience she has acquired keeping bulls of varying weights, she's been able to sell between 8 and 12 bulls a year in the auction in her area.\r\n\r\nIsabel will buy bulls between 350 and 400 kilos in weight, so that she can later sell them at a weight between 700-750 kilos in the Coto Brus cattle auction that takes place every Thursday.

His partner of 7 years takes care of the housework. They have two children who live with them.\r\n\r\nElmer has worked in agriculture for 12 years, although his father taught him how to grow corn and beans from a very young age. Elmer also works as a fisherman, when he is not working in agriculture, in order to earn an additional income. Elmer's work is just a few minutes away from his home, and his wife helps him out from time to time. His work day starts from 6 am.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan in order to buy compost, seeds and fertililzers, as well as other necessary products for corn production. This loan will help him to have the supplies to sow and therefore ensure that his children have food to eat.\r\n\r\nElmer's dreams are to continue working doing what he likes and which has always been the way he gets his family ahead. He also wants to install a sales point for his grain, since currently he goes out to sell his produce which increases his costs. He hopes that his children study and will have a better way of earning a living.\r\n\r\nElmer will invest the income he generates from this work into sowing other agricultural products, in order to increase his income and have a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1676450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy compost, seeds and fertilizers, as well as other necessary products for corn production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-28T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-27T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmer Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":36.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":40.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":42.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":41.77,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":41.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501678},{"amount":78.89,"local_amount":78.89,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":78.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420479},{"amount":31.73,"local_amount":31.73,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":31.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145585},{"amount":43.62,"local_amount":43.62,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":43.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769154},{"amount":39.08,"local_amount":39.08,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":39.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832826},{"amount":43.48,"local_amount":43.48,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":43.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200609},{"amount":221.43,"local_amount":221.43,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":221.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536381}],"funded_date":"2014-09-26T11:33:17Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:18:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Brown","image":1233582}},{"id":758517,"name":"Emely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emely is 32 years old and single.

This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg, or other things. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price, and  then she will sell them per piece for a higher price to make a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby, and the people in the community. She earns PHP 500 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a PHP 30,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nGerly hopes to have an expansion of her business. She only dreams to improve the general living condition of her family.

One is still at school and the other one is still small.  She has been selling rice, cooking oil, maize flour, backing flour, sugar, and beans for seven years now.  She works from 7am to 4pm daily and is able to make a very small monthly profit. <br \/><br \/>This will be Mwanaisha's seventh loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

Meet Peter, who is a very hard-working, passionate and dedicated small-scale farmer. He is based in Chemoge, a remote village in Bungoma. He is happily married and together with his beautiful wife are blessed with five children. For the past six years he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. He sells milk and farm produce to his neighbors and to the local market but has been facing one big problem and that is timely delivery of the products to the market. He is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that would solve his transportation problem. Chemoge is located in a very remote area that has a poor road network and the terrain is very bad. The only mode of transport is Boda Boda (motorbike).This loan will be of great help because it will allow Peter to transport his farm products to the market and deliver them timely. Milk and vegetables are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch high prices. Through the loan, Peter will not be worried because he will always deliver the products on time and gain more profits. This motorbike will be reliable for quick transportation for both long and short distances. Through the motorbike, Peter's life is going to change and his standards of living are going to improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1677902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bungoma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.566667 34.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-28T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-27T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.81,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4079.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4863.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4941.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5119.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5213.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5590.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5648.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5821.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5957.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6128.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6282.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.41,"local_amount":6361.86,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6488.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547695},{"amount":42.07,"local_amount":3646.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3719.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680701},{"amount":74.45,"local_amount":6452.21,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6581.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624992},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":5065.78,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5166.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194072},{"amount":129.45,"local_amount":11218.61,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11442.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823472},{"amount":85.13,"local_amount":7378.05,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7525.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264096},{"amount":73.78,"local_amount":6394.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6522.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600244},{"amount":30.72,"local_amount":2662.7,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2715.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458833},{"amount":112.56,"local_amount":10262.78,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10467.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.86,"payment_id":696586935},{"amount":59.17,"local_amount":5557.06,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5668.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.95,"payment_id":711505168}],"funded_date":"2014-09-26T21:03:59Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":758569,"name":"Rasoolan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasoolan belongs to Lahore.

At home, she is a lovely mother of three dependent children and two married children. To make a living, she manages and operates a rice farming business in a small farmland which is located near her house. So far, she has been involved in this career for twenty five years. \r\n\r\nUk wants to have household energy at a reduced monthly cost by purchasing a solar energy home system.

She is single and the mother of three children.  Her business involves making knitted baby blankets out of alpaca wool.<br \/><br \/>Virginia is a person who is enterprising, determined, strong, decisive, responsible, and extremely hardworking.  She goes about her work in the community of Batallas, which is known for having scarce vegetation and for also being an arid land that undergoes erosion.  All of these factors contribute to the cool, but humid, climate that is also influenced by Lake Titicaca.  The evaporation from this body of water helps to create a more pleasant climate than that experienced in the highlands.  <br \/><br \/>Virginia is tan-skinned and has long black braided hair.  She wears traditional clothing and her native language is Aymara.  However, she speaks Spanish for her business and when traveling to the city.  Virginia makes hand-knitted traditional blankets from alpaca wool.  Alpaca fibers are considered to be one of the finest and most luxurious materials in the world.  This material is scarce in the market, not only for its physical qualities, but because of its capacity to keep things warm, its softness, and its resistance.  Products made from this material are exclusive.  Virginia collects the wool from her own animals, but she also buys wool in order to continue her production.  She has been in business for seven years and needs to improve her quality of life.  Therefore, she needs to buy a knitting machine and more alpaca wool.  <br \/><br \/>For these reasons, Virginia is requesting a loan.  The money will be used for the purchase of a knitting machine and additional alpaca wool.

The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family expenses. He needs to improve his income level, and that is why he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nJoseph passionately loves dairy farming and as he likes to put it \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart\u201d. He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow but to buy a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and also towards the education of his children. He will also benefit from cow manure which will be used in increasing the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan he will also be able to build a biogas digester that will be helpful in saving energy.

The biggest challenge he has encountered is getting access to funds, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, he feels relieved and knows his dream of improving his living conditions will come to pass. Through the loan he will buy good quality seeds, fertilizer and implements that will increase productivity in his farm. Increased productivity will translate to more income and hence, more profit margins. He plans to reinvest the profits back to the land, so as to ensure continuous improvements.

He will be starting his 3rd year this year, and his family has to pay for the new school year. Mislima does not have enough savings and sees obtaining a loan as the only solution. When she came to Humo for the loan, she was offered an education loan with a low interest rate. She liked this loan. The entire loan amount - 1200 US dollars - will be used to pay the tuition obligation.

This will let him offer a greater variety of products to satisfy the immediate needs of his customers, increasing sales and the income he receives for his labor.\r\n\r\nCarlos has the spirit of overcoming and the desire to move ahead with his family that push him to continue fighting and to advance in order to meet the goal of acquiring his own home, in which he can enjoy a better quality of life in the company of his family and provide his daughter with a good education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1676492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for his business such as groceries, grains, soft drinks, fritters, liquors, and other food products to stock his store and give his daughter an education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sahagun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-08-28T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-27T19:20:09Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":88.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71321},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73308},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75351},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77451},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79609},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81827},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84107},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86451},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88860},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91336},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93881},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96498}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":70715,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":73953.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542542752},{"amount":79.88,"local_amount":149850,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":156712.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.54,"payment_id":561675667},{"amount":36.45,"local_amount":76866,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80386.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.83,"payment_id":595189488},{"amount":36.75,"local_amount":77665,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":81221.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.97,"payment_id":611814768},{"amount":269.43,"local_amount":624904,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":653523.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":74.26,"payment_id":624864495}],"funded_date":"2014-09-26T23:15:11Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:31:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":757552,"name":"Martha Elisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha es una se\u00f1ora colombiana, es casada y tiene 3 hijas, Martha juntamente con su esposo se dedica el jornal y tambi\u00e9n cr\u00eda chanchos que los tiene en un pedacito de terreno que lo cerr\u00f3 con alambre junto donde vive su madre, Martha se dedica a la crianza de chanchos desde que era muy joven, comenta que es su madre quien le ense\u00f1o a esta actividad, con el dinero del cr\u00e9dito va a comprar chanchos para incrementar su negocio, con el que espera progresar y a juntan un poco de dinero para comprar una casita.","en":"Martha is a Colombian woman.

She is single and lives with her small one year old daughter.  Wara tells us that her life was difficult because her parents decided to separate when she was seven.  She and her three sisters were left to live with their mother.  Later, two of them left home because they got pregnant and decided to live with their partners.  This situation greatly affected her mother, who took to drink and lost her job.   Shortly after, the household economy was affected and they even had to go to aid centers where they provided food because they didn\u2019t receive much financial support from their father.  However, seeing the situation, he decided to take them to live with his new family.\r\nWara decided to live alone and started working in a day-care center, and in the afternoons she studied for a secretarial degree.  She was a messenger, then a secretary, and now she is in charge of collections.  This professional growth made Wara decide to enroll in a technical course in the area of insurance.  She is confident that with the newly acquired knowledge and tools, she will have many more opportunities of growing and aspiring to a better salary.  Currently, her income is just enough to cover the monthly expenses for herself and her daughter.  Her dream is to become a professional and improve her income so that she can provide her daughter with a better quality of life and help her mother financially.  Wara is grateful to the people who provide her with the financial resources that will allow her to continue studying and fulfilling her dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1675286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

To provide additional income for her family, she has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 2005, initially starting with a purchase of 3 cows. Thanks to Kambarbu's hard work, today her business has 4 dairy cows, 18 sheep and 8 calves. She also has 0.8 hectares of land, where Kambarbu grows alfalfa. Her monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). To further develop her business, Kambarbu requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy dairy cows to buy calves for fattening up and subsequent resale at a market at a higher price.

In general, though, her business is moving forward little by little.  She would love to have a fixed space, because currently she sells her articles in a movable stand.  Her plan for the future is to have two stands, one that she will run and another for her husband.  Her profits will increase, which is precisely the goal she wants to realize in the medium term.  As an ultimate objective, Geovanna works to secure her children's education.\n\nShe'll use this loan to buy caps, shoes, coats, and so on.\n\nThe other members and investments are J.

In 1990 she and her husband started a business in another municipality in the department of Atl\u00e1ntico. Their idea was to open a store selling provisions. When they moved to the town, they started the store once again in one of the busiest neighborhoods in the south of the town. Now she, her husband, and their children run the store.\r\n\r\nThe most important items that Yaqueljne sells are rice, sugar, meat, salt, chicken, coffee and other basics. Local families buy these items in small quantities to feed their children. The store is open from 6am and closes at 10pm, selling goods on account to her customers who come from the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nYaqueline's goal is to improve the business by offering a wider variety of merchandise. Her greatest challenge is having enough money to achieve her dreams. She is now seeking a loan, her first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to buy mostly milk products and cooked meats. In this way she will improve her business as sales will increase as a result of the larger amount of stock for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1675375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

As can be seen in the photograph, it does not have them, so she is asking FUSIA for a loan to buy doors, balconies, cement, and sand to stucco the walls and put door and windows in her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1676479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy doors, balconies, cement, and sand to plaster the walls and put the doors and windows in her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-08-28T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-27T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoila Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":27.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":28.69},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":35.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.89},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.48,"local_amount":56.48,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-19T09:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":56.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":543044239},{"amount":29.63,"local_amount":29.63,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:15:48Z","rounded_local_amount":29.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562332746},{"amount":30.59,"local_amount":30.59,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":30.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579478086},{"amount":31.58,"local_amount":31.58,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":31.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595084324},{"amount":32.61,"local_amount":32.61,"processed_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T10:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":32.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611990144},{"amount":33.67,"local_amount":33.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-26T09:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":33.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626296187},{"amount":34.76,"local_amount":34.76,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":34.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636146326},{"amount":35.89,"local_amount":35.89,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649501311},{"amount":37.06,"local_amount":37.06,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":37.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664982979},{"amount":77.73,"local_amount":77.73,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":77.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711400300}],"funded_date":"2014-09-26T13:45:53Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T12:45:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":758694,"name":"Bernardine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernardine is 55 years old, and she is married with two children.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

the Central Province of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and they have three children. His primary income sources are milk, tea, other crops, and other personal businesses. Elizaphan has 20 years of experience in mixed farming.\r\n \r\nElizaphan is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. He has aspirations to expand his dairy farm. However, he lacks the finances needed to do so. This is because the milk price in Chuka is very low. The only way to achieve this is through loans\r\n\r\nSmall dairy farmers in Kenya work dawn to dark to produce high-quality milk at roughly the same price they received a decade ago, while the cost of feed, fuel and most other foods have steadily increased. These rural farmers are facing growing pressure to keep their farms running.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Elizaphan will be able to purchase a high quality cow. Typical hybrid cows in this region produce from 10 litres to 15 litres of milk, while taking the same amount of money to feed and treat as the less productive traditional breeds.\r\n\r\nThe increase in milk volume will earn Elizaphan more income to cope with the hard times. He is very dedicated to paying his children\u2019s education and your loan will be of great benefit towards this goal. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1678084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-28T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-27T22:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizaphan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2279.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2897.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3028.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3074},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3165.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3368.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3360.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3489.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3693.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3780.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3892.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4020.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4128.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4255.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.23,"local_amount":5826.29,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5942.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680705},{"amount":37.09,"local_amount":3214.14,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3278.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581624996},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":3657.02,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3730.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194076},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":6503.77,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6633.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261973},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":3517.61,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3587.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600247},{"amount":81.52,"local_amount":7064.95,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":7206.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458836},{"amount":243.64,"local_amount":22216.22,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":22659.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.69,"payment_id":696586938}],"funded_date":"2014-08-31T20:53:38Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":758755,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanne, 35, is married and has two children yet to be school-aged.

With the profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future, she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She succeeded in completing high school, and she is currently married. Her husband makes a living driving a motorcycle taxi in the municipality where they live. They have three children, two of whom are attending school. The other child stays at home with her because he is too young to go to school.              \r\n\r\nZochilt is a homemaker. Where she lives, the stores are far away. For this reason, and encouraged by the woman who owns the motorcycle taxi that her husband drives, Zochilt took the initiative to take out a loan to open a small store about six months ago. She has noticed that the business is good. Since there are no other stores nearby in her neighborhood, she is making it easier for people to do their shopping closer to home. Moreover, she is earning income for her family. She is the only one running the business. No one else in her family is involved.\r\n\r\nThe business is generating profits; therefore, the loan she is requesting is to buy a computer for her daughter so that she will no longer have to go out looking for a cybercafe. It is not safe, especially nowadays, for children to go out in the evenings or at nights to do their homework. In this way, her daughter will do hers at home, and she will help her a lot. The daughter will be able to fill her mind with wholesome information since they will be extra vigilant about her online activities.\r\n\r\nZochilt\u2019s dream is to continue with her business because she has enjoyed this occupation since she was very young. She relies on the opportunities that the loans give her. Moreover, she wants to better herself, get her family ahead, and help her husband with the home expenses so that together they are able to give their children the opportunity to study and become great professionals.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1676320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a computer for her daughter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-28T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-27T22:30:08Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zochilt Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":42.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.64,"local_amount":34.64,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":34.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501674},{"amount":36.05,"local_amount":36.05,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":36.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420475},{"amount":38.51,"local_amount":38.51,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":38.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545205},{"amount":38,"local_amount":38,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145581},{"amount":39.76,"local_amount":39.76,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":39.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769149},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":41.13,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":41.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832825},{"amount":271.91,"local_amount":271.91,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":271.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200605}],"funded_date":"2014-08-29T05:33:46Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:00:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":758746,"name":"Ramatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 48-year-old Ramatu.

Their new Friendship Bridge Trust Bank group is called \u201cMujeres Tejedoras,\u201d meaning \u201cWeaving Women,\u201d because of the beautiful and exquisitely woven huipiles (blouses) they make and wear with great pride. Each of the women in \u201cMujeres Tejedoras\u201d has a small business that makes or sells textiles.\r\n\r\nCatarina, who is 18 years old, married to a boat driver, and has a child, is the Trust Bank secretary. Because her parents felt Catarina\u2019s main role was to be a wife and mother, she was only allowed to go to school through the 4th grade. Although she only had a 4th grade education, Catarina overcame the lack of respect given women without an education and began a small handicrafts and commercial textile business. She buys from three local community women and then resells the products - including huipiles, fajas (belts), purses, bracelets, and other handicrafts - in different markets.

The eight ladies of \u201cTikal\u201d have concluded their first loan cycle thanks to the support of Kiva lenders. Due to this support, the ladies were able to expand and\/or maintain their small businesses.\r\n\r\nTomasa, a 39 year-old widow, was our featured client in the previous loan cycle. With her loan, she was able to buy 20 more chickens, two pigs, and feed for all of the animals she raises. Tomasa is very grateful for Kiva lenders\u2019 support, because it enabled her to create more income for her family\u2019s well-being.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of \u201cTikal\u201d are applying for a new loan cycle they hope can be funded by Kiva lenders. In this loan cycle, we want to introduce Maria, the new Trust Bank treasurer.  She is 53-years-old, married to a field worker, and has four children whose ages are between 17 and 11. Three of them are currently in school.  \r\n\r\nLike many of the women in rural Guatemala, Maria is a weaver. She also raises chickens and goats. Her business is doing very well, but she needs more financial capital in order to keep expanding. Therefore, she is applying for a new loan. With this loan, she will buy a large quantity of good quality silk and wool thread. She also plans to buy feed for her animals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the loan, Maria is looking forward to the Friendship Bridge \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d training where she can learn about topics related to good health practices for both her and her family, along with the topics of hygiene, self-esteem, leadership, and empowerment.  Friendship Bridge has found these \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d programs are motivational, providing a very supportive environment where the ladies can discuss issues freely, which increases their self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Friendship Bridge \u201cTikal\u201d group are extremely grateful for the support they have had from Kiva lenders!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":1678404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

At this time, she is working hard to provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJosephine owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is connected to or just inside their house. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. Josephine gets her products from a wholesaler at a low price, and then she sells it by the piece for a higher price to earn a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby, and the people in the community. She earns PHP 300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Josephine is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store. Josephine hopes to improve her business and her family's general living conditions. She also desires to give the best education for her child. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Santo Domingo is very much a business city, considered to be a terrestrial port linking the mountains and coast.  Alonso has lived apart from his partner for several years, and his children even live with their mother in another city.  However, the fact of not living together has not led him to neglect his children.  Alonso is always supporting them.\r\n\r\nAlonso earns his living selling electrical and hardware items, going around  neighborhoods near the city.  Besides this business, when the season is right, he sells shellfish, since he has faithful customers.  He offers his products three times a week.  Alonso needs a loan to buy materials such as cables, water pumps and blow torches.   Because of lack of capital, he couldn't get these; he turned to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, and they could help him.  Alonso feels immensely grateful to the organization and to Kiva for helping him grow and improve his business.  He dreams of having his own place of business in future.

Just at this point, there is a lot of commercial trade to be the land port connecting the mountains and the coast. \r\n\r\nHere lives B\u00e9lgica, a 38-year-old woman, separated, who has two daughters. One is still studying in school and at most, she helps her mother for the moment, but she has plans to continue her university studies.\r\n\r\nB\u00e9lgica, in spite of not having a husband at her side, has gotten ahead by herself. She has worked very hard to give her daughters an education. \r\n\r\nShe works every day selling clothes, walking through her sector and also visiting places where she already has regular customers. In addition to this income, she has corn and peanuts planted on a piece of her father's land to help her with household expenses.\r\n\r\nB\u00e9lgica is a new client to the institution, which went to her for the opportunity they give in helping microentrepreneurs through loans. She feels happy, as with the loan she's received, she will be able to improve her income so her daughter can go to university and needs it to be able to give her an education. \r\n\r\nWith the money, she will buy more merchandise: pants, blouses, handbags, shoes, thus continuing to travel and increasing her business. She thanks all who are Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, and Kiva especially, because credit delivery help many people to thrive in their small businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1676566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more merchandise to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belgica Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":566.35,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":79.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":82.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":86.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.24,"local_amount":77.06,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":78.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516278},{"amount":80.57,"local_amount":79.36,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649864},{"amount":80.32,"local_amount":79.11,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579564666},{"amount":83.14,"local_amount":81.89,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595161971},{"amount":84.62,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":84.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610558556},{"amount":86.5,"local_amount":85.2,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":86.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231628},{"amount":81.61,"local_amount":80.38,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":81.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636217444}],"funded_date":"2014-08-31T00:39:17Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:39:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Alexander","image":1669027}},{"id":758996,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic works hard to support her family.

Her daughter and son are married and live with their own families.<br \/><br \/>Larisa runs a small, rented store, where she trades in different fabrics and home appliances. Because autumn is very close, Larisa needs to prepare her business for winter. For that reason she needs a loan of USD 3,000. She will use it to purchase a new stock of goods to sell (fabrics, curtains, bed linens). The loan will help her sustain her business. Larisa highly relies on the goodwill of the lenders, and will appreciate their support in collecting the needed amount for her loan.<br \/><br \/>Larisa has previously taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back, because the family faced difficulties. However, thanks to their recent hard work, Larisa is now able to run her business in a way that ensures that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. She has been approved for a loan, within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

He was making a great living, traveling and selling jewelry pieces to other major stores. The traveling for work and sales grew tiring. In 2012, Trevor and his wife made the move to Texas to embark on their new journey in the custom furniture business. Together they created Industrial Envy, LLC. \r\n\r\nBased out of Austin, Texas, Industrial Envy is a company that specializes in crafting custom handmade furniture for residential and commercial applications. \u201cI am not great at drawing, but I am great with creating unique concepts,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy coming up with things that no one has ever done before and making it happen.\u201d\r\n\r\nSince starting the company in 2013, Industrial Envy has picked up 100 clients online and another 100 clients offline through networking. They are currently working on crafting custom furniture pieces for a local wine and spirits store. Industrial Envy is giving the store a \u201crustic, upscale, moonshine-themed\u201d makeover. \r\n\r\nTrevor currently employs three part-time workers. One employee specializes in glass blowing, another is skilled in creative design and the third employee is a carpenter. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a real passion for working with other creative entrepreneurs,\u201d Trevor said. \u201cThere are tons of creative people making things out of their garage just looking to get into the market.\u201d\r\n\r\nTrevor has a plan to recruit other artisans to help grow his business. His dream is to turn the furniture retail world upside down. He understands that there are struggling artists trying to break into the custom furniture retail business. He wants to give them the chance to have their creations recognized. \r\nBusiness is doing well for the young Austin business. He is seeking working capital from Accion Texas to further grow his business. \r\n\r\nTrevor said he and his wife learned about Accion Texas when they read an article about microlending in Entrepreneur Magazine. They had been researching loan options for months. Trevor saw that Accion was at the top of the list and began looking for a Texas location.

There is much communication between them and their intention is to continue this way to repay their loan without difficulty.\r\n\r\nRuben is 38 years old and has been married to Silvia for 16 years.  Together they formed a family with their three children.  They have a very successful business making backpacks, which they started 15 years ago.  Ruben decided to continue the same line of work as his father, and was in constant contact with the activities and worked for his father as a boy.  However, Ruben decided to go out on his own because he had a family of his own and he wanted to work for them.

Diego is a generous and hard-working man who, for the last thirteen years, has made his living in carpentry.  He started the business with a small machine, which he got through a loan.  Thanks to constant and high-quality work, Diego got a lot of customers.  This generated a good income and allowed him to increase the number of machines he had.  Diego is currently still working in his passion.  He is 37-years old, married and has three children, who are 13, 12 and 4-years old respectively.  All of his children go to school, as he wants to guarantee them a prosperous future.  \r\nDiego is requesting the loan to build a bathroom in his home.  Right now he only has a privy instead of a toilet, which is very risky for him and his whole family, as they are exposed to various diseases.  And so Diego is placing his confidence in the loan.  He hopes to provide his family with good health, so they can achieve solid progress in their community.  He plans to keep working toward making improvements to his home's infrastructure.  Diego wants his family to live in a safe and stable environment.  One of his goals is to establish different carpentry branches in different communities, and thereby be able to keep earning money. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1167.42,"image":{"id":1677150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to build a bathroom in his home.

He sells medicine for daily maladies such as headaches or stomach pain. He is 27 years old, single, and has three children who are two, three, and five years old; at the moment only the oldest attends school. He began to work at a very young age. He did not have the economic resources to pay for university studies. His first job was as an attendant in a used clothing store, and later in the sale of agrochemicals; now he sells medications.\r\n\r\nEmilio is asking for the loan to increase the production of his capital. He needs to buy medicine: headache pills, such as Panadol and Diclofenac. He also needs serum and anti-inflammatory creams, among others. One of his principle objectives is to expand his business, which is why he places his trust in the financing.

It brings together women who became acquainted through kinship and neighborhood ties. They are on average 40 years old, married with three children.\r\n\r\nThey conduct various activities such as buying and selling condiments, like Fatoumata, the second person sitting from left to right in the photo. They live in large traditional families in N'Tentou in the Ouelessebougou sub-prefecture (which is part of the Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nThey have been running small businesses for several years and are in high demand for their activities trading condiments: pepper, tomatoes, onions and cabbages.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy their customers' growing demand, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago. They are on their eighth group loan.\r\n\r\nFatoumata, who is the group's president and is well known in N'Tentou, excels in selling condiments. She will use her loan to buy 15 baskets of tomatoes and a large quantity of various culinary condiments (pepper, onions, and cabbages).\r\n\r\nShe resupplies in Ouelessebougou and with local wholesalers, and retails her condiments in Ouelessebougou, for cash and on credit, to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to attain monthly profits of 50,000 CFA francs, which will enable her to repay the loan and reinvest the rest in her condiment-trading activity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1679512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She will use her loan to buy 10 bags of n\u00e9r\u00e9 beans.\r\n\r\nShe resupplies in Ouelessebougou and retails her product in 100-kilo bags in Bamako, for cash and on credit, to a mixed clientele.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to attain monthly profits of 30,000 CFA francs, which will enable her to repay the loan and reinvest the rest in her business activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1679516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy n\u00e9r\u00e9 beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.58,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":42227.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542659140},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":42227.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793355},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42227.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793356},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":42227.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758248},{"amount":83.42,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42227.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.58,"payment_id":595318802}],"funded_date":"2014-08-29T12:26:14Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":758036,"name":"Brisas Del Mar # 4 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"AGRIPINA vive con su compa\u00f1ero sentimental.

The group has seven hard-working members who, every day, look after the well-being of their family. To do this, each one of them has started a business.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about the area here is the national holiday, celebrated on 24 November as this is when the Feast of Christ the King, the local patron saint, takes place. On this day, in the morning serenades are sung from 6am until 10am, mass is taken, and local children are baptised. In the afternoon and evening, the celebration continues with folk events, fireworks, fairground rides and dancing. These are times where everybody can have fun safely in the company of friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe members of \"Las Limonarias\" group and their businesses are:\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda: sells shoes out of a catalogue;\r\nJosefina: sells meat;\r\nJuan: sells groceries;\r\nMar\u00eda de los Angeles: sells snacks;\r\nRita: sells chicken;\r\nAtanacia: sells snacks; and \r\nHumberto: grinding service.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is happy, hard-working and friendly woman.

He looks after them and ensures that there are basic grains to give to his family.\r\n\r\nThis loan from CrediCampo will be used to buy manure, weed-killers and fungicides to apply to crops on the necessary dates; this will guarantee a good yield of basic grains so that Miguel's family will not need for anything during the low season.\r\n\r\nMiguel wants to continue to grow many basic grains and thus guarantee food for his family.

He studied until the secondary education, but he could not complete his study because of the hard condition of his family. \r\n\r\nIn order to assist his parents in covering the expenses of his family, Haytham decided to work in an ice cream factory in the capital city of Sana'a. Haytham is a very dynamic and clever young man. In time, he accumulated a good amount of money from that work in order to start his own business. Unfortunately, that accumulated money was not enough to go ahead in his business, so his father supported him financially. \r\n\r\nHaytham has been running his own business, which is a small an ice cream factory, for more than four years. He started that business with a small amount of capital. Little by little, his business increased more and more. Haytham found this business is very profitable for him. \r\n\r\nFor further expanding in his own business, Haytham applied for a youth loan of 200,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase sugar, flour, and the other necessary materials for make ice cream and sell it.\r\n\r\nHaytham looks forward to providing his business more through purchasing other ice cream equipment and all the necessary
