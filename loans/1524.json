He lives with his family in the capital city of Sana'a, Yemen. He is a university graduate. Due to high rates of the unemployment in the country, Ez Al- Den couldn't find a job to look after of his family. The working opportunities in the country these days have become very limited and few. Due to that, Ez Al- Den is one of many of Yemeni youth people who have a university education, but they can not find jobs to look after of their family. Ez Al- Den doesn't surrender to that condition, but strives strongly to go ahead to improve the living condition of his family. He is a talented and responsible professional young man. He has a high determination inside himself to go ahead to make a secure future for his child. From this side, he decided to start his own business.

They said thanks to you lenders, Kiva, and MUK for supporting their businesses.\r\n\r\nNow Kadek has a new activity - in addition to farming in her garden, she has also busied herself with raising pigs. In this way, Kadek has a higher income than before she began raising pigs. The breeding process is going well without any obstacles. The advantage of raising pigs is she can use them for her family's everyday needs.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in the previous loan period, the Nyuh Gading group is proceeding to its next loan. Based on the assessment of MUK, the group received 9,000,000 IDR for group lending and individuals each received 1,500,000 IDR. Because most have been able to increase the number of pigs they have, the current loan will be used to buy food and fix cages. Kadek will use her loan portion to buy superior feed and build new cages. She already has four sows. Kadek is very happy and she hopes to become a big pig seller in her village, using all the profits to improve the welfare of her family and make her dreams come true.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1679101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy superior feed and build new cages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.04,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":752.96,"local_amount":9000000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9058665,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.04,"payment_id":624270349}],"funded_date":"2014-08-31T00:33:22Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":758078,"name":"Pablo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Pablo tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado con la se\u00f1ora Margarita, viven en la zona sudoeste de la ciudad, ambos tienen un grado de instrucci\u00f3n de nivel primario, tienen 3 hijos dependientes de sus ingresos quienes a\u00fan asisten al colegio por las ma\u00f1anas y por las tardes.

The three youngest are in school. She has been raising livestock since 1990 and currently has two cows, one calf, two horses, and eight sheep. Her only income comes from cattle sales and financial assistance for her children. She currently earns 2,500 som (KGS) per month, which is not enough to support a family and live a decent life. She needs to expand her business. Because the winter season is approaching, Burulkan wants to buy feed for the livestock and applied for a loan of 35,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank. This will allow her to take care of the livestock and increase their numbers. In the future, Burulkan dreams of giving her children a good education and of helping her son to build his own

Meet Veronica, 40 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer who is based in Koibarak, a remote village in Kapsowar. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. Veronica is happily married and blessed with 4 children. For the past 3 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. \r\n\r\nShe passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Kapsowar area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. \r\n\r\nVeronica is a member of Kaptabuk and through the group they have received training on financial management and saving. Through the loan she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently. Profits from the loan will be used in repaying back the loan and increasing her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1679140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy additional poultry.

They describe him as a kind and hardworking man. As the main source of income for his family, Majed has sold groceries and food products in a small grocery since 2012. He started this business with a small amount of capital. Thanks to Majed's hard work, he has been able to develop and expand his merchandise. The profits from this business have allowed Majed to expand his sales volume. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of further developing his business, Majed turned to Al-Amal Microfinance Bank. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 YER to buy more food items for future retail in his grocery in order to meet all the demands of his customers.\r\n\r\nMajed plans to invest the earnings from the loan to further increase his business.

Meet Alice, a very dedicated mother who believes in hard work. She is happily married and blessed with 4 lovely children whom she often refers to as \u201cmy pride\u201d. She is based in Kapsowar, a small remote rural town in Kenya. For the past 2 years she has actively been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk and crop farming. \r\n\r\nAlice passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that she has nicknamed one of her cows \u201cChebirir\u201d. Milking Chebirir (the name of her cow) is her hobby, and feeding her cow makes her very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Alice. Although this humble mum makes a living through selling milk, she faces the challenge of meeting the demand that is in her area. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy a quality breed of cow. The loan will enable her to buy not just an ordinary cow but an exotic breed that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. With this cow she will be assured of increased income and an increase in profit margins. Being from a marginalized community women face many challenges, but Alice believes that through Kiva lenders her dream of being financially stable will be achieved. \r\n\r\nSelling milk will provide a regular income for Alice and hence meet the daily expenses of her family. Alice's dream is to increase her milk selling enterprise and help secure the future of her children through giving them a proper education. Education is the only way that her children, who are from a marginalized community, can succeed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1679151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She married at 18 and had five children with her spouse. Her husband is a farmer and the five children live in her house. Three of them study and the other two work there. No one else lives with them.<br \/><br \/>Besides being a housewife Mar\u00eda supports her son and husband with the farming. She works in a fish pond where she raises and sells tilapia. She started the tilapia business two years ago after having participating in training about raising fish that took place in her community. From this she got her idea of starting her own fish pond. Other than the business that is created by the sales she has no other activities. The pond is about 100 meters from her house. <br \/><br \/>The investment from the previous loan that she got through Kiva was not successful as there was a drought in the zone and the crops didn't produce. So now they will try once again attempt to grow the basic grains which are the basis of their day to day food. <br \/><br \/>The loan that she is requesting from CrediCampo is to buy corn seed, pesticides, herbicides and pay for labor. The improvement will be to have the working capital to to try again to produce what they need. Once they have what they need then they can continue to struggle to produce what they consume. <br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda wants to keep her family together, that is the most important thing. Next is the struggle against their setbacks which she hopes will be a good example of being responsible for her children in the future. The loan will help her with the aforementioned needs and she hopes that the profits from the investment will pay off the loan and support her household."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1581870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy corn seed, pesticides, herbicides and pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T15:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T15:50:07Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":11.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":11.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":11.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":12.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":12.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":12.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":13.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":13.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":13.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.45,"local_amount":11.45,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":11.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501683},{"amount":12.03,"local_amount":12.03,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420483},{"amount":11.91,"local_amount":11.91,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545211},{"amount":12.28,"local_amount":12.28,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":12.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145589},{"amount":12.65,"local_amount":12.65,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769158},{"amount":89.68,"local_amount":89.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":89.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832830}],"funded_date":"2014-08-30T02:58:28Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":759358,"name":"Yasmeen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yasmeen is a housewife and lives in Rawalpindi with her family.

The lack of schools in the area that they lived in did not allow her to continue her education since the people who taught in the area focused on early childhood education.  Since she was not attending school, she dedicated herself to helping her parents with the household work.  She is married, and her husband works as a driver.  He has a vehicle that he uses to transport anyone who seeks him.  All of her daughters are at home with her since they do not attend school.  In their home, three of her grandchildren also live with them.\r\n\r\nShe has a stall where she sells tortillas, which she makes with the help of her daughters.  This is her primary source of income.  She has been working in this business for over 15 years.  She started the business by putting into practice everything that she learned when she was at home.  Today, she is very well-known in the town and she has a great customer base.  She does not work in another business.  Her business is run from her home, and she works from 7am to 4pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is seeking from Credicampo will be used to purchase corn, lime and firewood to make tortillas.

He doesn't surrender to his condition, but strives strongly to improve the living condition of his family. He is very respected and a personal young man and knows how to run his life well. Most Yemeni young people who graduated from the universities couldn't find jobs to look after their families. Fawzi is one of those young people, but he didn't surrender to that miserable condition. As a result, he decided to start his own business through opening a small shop to sell different kinds of food materials and merchandise for the local residents inside his area where he lives with his family. He has rented a small store in his area for one year and decided to make it a grocery. This grocery needs preparation from the inside to be more attractive to customers. The grocery doesn't have the basic decor. For this reason, he didn't open it officially. Unfortunately, he doesn't have enough money for that. For this reason, Fawzi applied for a loan of 200,000 YER from AMB.

His oldest child is 5 years old, and the youngest one is 8 months old. Bakel has a diploma certificate and he is an employee with a small salary. In reality his salary is not enough to cover all the expenses of his family. He lives with his family in his own house. Unfortunately, the house where Bakel and his family live is very far from the place where he works. \r\n\r\nAfter many years, Bakel decided to purchase a car to use for transportation. His car helped him very much in saving a lot of money that he was paying for transportation from the area where he lives to the place where he works; he uses it to go to any place he wants. \r\n\r\nHis car has became old, and now it needs spare parts to work well. Bakel's salary is not enough to purchase the spare parts. For this reason, he applied for a Youth loan of 150,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase spare parts for his own car to make it work better. \r\n\r\nBakel looks forward to purchasing a new taxi, beside his own first car, and work with it as a driver to transport people from one area to another area. That will let him earn a lot of money that will help him in providing his family with a better future. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1679240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase spare parts for his own car to make it work better.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Haja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12511},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12499}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":758140,"name":"Nader Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nader es un campesino de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, trabajador y humilde, que desde ni\u00f1o aprendi\u00f3 a realizar todas las labores del campo, gracias a las ense\u00f1anzas de sus padres. \n\nEsto le ha permitido progresar y, hoy en d\u00eda posee cultivos de pl\u00e1tano y Yuca, cultivos que atiende todos los d\u00edas y las cosechas son vendidas en la plaza de mercado del municipio de Valencia, C\u00f3rdoba, adicionalmente, realiza labores de jornalero en diferentes fincas de la regi\u00f3n, pues con ello complementa los ingresos con los que vela por el bienestar de sus 4 hijos y su esposa. \n\nCon el apoyo del cr\u00e9dito comprar\u00e1 insumos agr\u00edcolas al por mayor (abonos, pesticidas, fertilizantes y otros), con esto seguir\u00e1 cuidando sus cultivos y tendr\u00e1 una mejor cosecha, con lo que mejorar\u00e1 los ingresos a la hora de vender sus productos. \n\nNader, con su esp\u00edritu emprendedor, su pujanza y tenacidad, quiere seguir luchando para cumplir el sue\u00f1o de tener una finca propia, en la que pueda cultivar mucha m\u00e1s variedad de productos y as\u00ed mejorar la rentabilidad del negocio, garantizando una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica para dar mejor calidad de vida a su familia.\n\n","en":"Nader is a 39 year-old farmer who is unassuming and hardworking.

His partner is a housewife and takes care of their kids. She also does embroidery and sells her work to contribute to the household earnings. They have two children; the oldest is 13 years old and is in the 5th grade, and their little girl does not yet attend school. A nephew of his wife\u2019s also lives with them.\r\n\r\nEdwin works in agriculture, and he has already worked in this field for 20 years. His father made him a good person with guidance and a good upbringing. Edwin is a leader in his community, and he does community projects with complete effort, since the only work in his area is agriculture. Edwin has been a responsible man and has raised his two children responsibly. His work is close to his house, and he gets to work by foot. No one is more dedicated to the work; he works from 6:00am to 10:00am. He received a previous loan through Kiva, but his investment went poorly, since his crops dried out because of a lack of rain. He now wants to try to realize a new harvest. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to pay for the tractor and workmates who help Edwin with the sowing. Now he wants to start sowing again to see if he can grow at least as much as he consumes.

As a way of generating income, he is engaged in a variety store business within his community in Silang, Cavite, Philippines. He, together with his wife, works hard to provide for the everyday needs of their family. He also has a computer shop for additional income.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nDue to financial insufficiency, Tirso wants to make his business more profitable in order to earn a higher income. With this, he would like to avail a loan amounting to 19,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional grocery items that are needed. He is hoping that he will further improve the business through this financial assistance.\r\n\r\nTirso hopes that his business will continue to expand and dreams to give his children a good life and education.

Tamil Nadu. All of them are working to help supplement their family income. \r\n\r\nThese women, apart from working hard all day long, also need to labor in front of the traditional \u201cchulha\u201d stoves while cooking. These stoves emit a lot of smoke, which is a health hazard for the whole family and especially the women. Also, the families need to spend an average of Rs. 200 for the firewood and additional expenses towards medical needs.\r\n\r\nSo, Pugalenthi and her friends have approached People's Action for Transformation (PAT), Micrograam\u2019s field partner, which promotes fuel-efficient cookstoves as part of their energy initiative. The benefits of the Greenway cookstove are fuel savings, using all solid fuels, minimized emissions of CO and CO2, fast and convenient cooking, and high durability; they are also maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels, such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal, and dry dung, and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy these cookstoves, Pugalenthi and her friends have formed the Annaitherasa Self-Help Group and are seeking a group loan, which is repayable in easy installments. Your loan will not only help these women in preventing respiratory diseases, but also help the environment. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1679156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a fuel-efficient cookstove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Ariyalur, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T19:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T19:50:13Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pugalenthi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rathidevi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kannagi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalaiyarasi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shantha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parvathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chitra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mookayi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Poobathi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalatha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neelavathi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amutha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vennila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indiraganthi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalaiyarasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":22400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":22400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-08-30T22:19:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":759383,"name":"Sumarni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumarni is 40 years old and married.

Most of their fellow villagers, including these 20 women, work during the day as laborers in nearby industries and farms. They make just enough money to return to a home in the evenings and feed themselves and be able to repeat the same thing all over again the next day. It is harder for the women, who also attend to the myriad domestic chores, such as cleaning, washing and cooking. Apart from the physical exertion, it is the lack of respite from the dust and smoke, at work and at home, that takes a toll and makes them susceptible to health hazards. Lung diseases are extremely common.\r\n\r\nPAT (Micrograam\u2019s partner) works to address part of the problem. They promote clean, energy-efficient cooking stoves, so that, at least while cooking, the women\u2019s exposure to soot and smoke is minimized. The stoves use dung, agro-waste, etc. as fuel and so, have low CO2 emissions. They are also very cheap to run and help save significant amounts of money. So, Parameswari (featured borrower holding a board with SHG name) and her group have decided to buy these stoves. They are all married and most have young kids. They know it is imperative that they offer their kids as healthy a life as possible, so they can grow up and extricate their families from the poverty spiral they are trapped in. They do not have enough money to buy these stoves outright. They seek to borrow the requisite amount and repay it within the specified time. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1679309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy an energy-efficient cooking stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Ariyalur, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parameswari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Periyammal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalaiyarasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhavamani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selvi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alamelu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pathmavathy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saroja ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanalakshmi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karpagam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajeswari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chellammal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kolanji ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sundharambal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thamaraiselvi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sivagami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Renganayagi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":28000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-01T17:53:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":758159,"name":"Jose Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 es un hombre emprendedor y dedicado al negocio propio que es compra y venta de pan, actividad que realiza desde hace 17 a\u00f1os contando con los clientes principales del municipio donde vive  y  de diferentes aldeas.\nDon Jos\u00e9  las ventas las realiza todos los d\u00edas de la semana, compra su producto en Tegucigalpa donde le dan un  precio c\u00f3modo,  est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra  de diferentes tipos de pan como semita, pan blanco, polvor\u00f3n, donas, enrollado, quesadilla, etc. espera que esta inversi\u00f3n le permita obtener los ingresos necesarios para mejorar un poco su calidad de vida y la de su familia.\nDon Jos\u00e9 uno de sus sue\u00f1os es que su negocio crezca y poder seguir apoyando a su familia.  \n\nDanl\u00ed, Honduras \u2013 Julio  2014\n","en":"Se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 is an enterprising man, and he is devoted to his business, which is the purchase and sale of bread.

She likes doing this because it is how she has improved her family\u2019s living conditions, and she has improved her community.  The second business activity that she does is growing carrots on land that is available close to her house.\r\n\r\nShe makes good contributions to her community.  That is why a group of women have joined her to undertake the business activity of selling vegetables together.  They do this so that they, too, will improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy vegetables and fertilizers.  This way she will improve her crops in order to get good harvests.  She will also improve her sales at the community market by having good harvests.  \r\n\r\nHer aspiration is to expand her business and to build houses so that the children will have adequate living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1677340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to

Amos passionately loves farming but the biggest challenge he faces is transportation of the products to the market and timely delivery. Kapsowar area has poor roads and the terrain makes it even worse. He faces challenges transporting his produce especially during the rainy seasons. \r\n\r\nAmos is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Because of poor feeder roads and bad terrain this loan will assist him a great deal. Through the loan he will be able to transport his produce from the farm and deliver it to the market on time. Milk is very perishable and requires quick delivery to the market and through the loan he will be able to make quick deliveries and never suffer losses. Eggs are very fragile and they require proper handling and through the motorbike he will be able to transport his eggs using crates to the market.\r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, an institution that supports small holder farmers, Amos is assured that his dreams will come to pass. Amos has gone through financial and technical training with Juhudi Kilimo and is confident that through savings from the loan he will improve his living conditions and repay back the loan.

She is 35 years of age and full of energy. She is based in Nyakoe, a remote area in the rich highlands of Kisii. She is a single mother and has single-handedly raised her three children, although not in very good circumstances, but she has always put on a brave face. \r\n\r\nHer primary source of income is selling a variety of food crops and milk. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. Dairy farming is a profitable business venture in the Kisii area, and the demand is great. Judith wants to take advantage and diversify her farming by acquiring an exotic breed of dairy cow. She is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nJudith is an enterprising woman and wants not only to buy a cow, but she intends to buy a quality cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. Through the cow she will increase her income levels and also increase her profit margins. Through Juhudi Kilimo, Judith went through financial training and has mastered all aspects of savings. Saved profits will be used in repaying back the loan and increasing her business. \r\n\r\nShe intends to start a yoghurt and cream selling business. Increased profits from the loan will also allow her start a bio-gas plant in her compound, hence saving costs spent on fuel. In the long run, Judith will be able to improve her standards of living and secure the future of her children, since she is the only breadwinner.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1679420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":36400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2210.32},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2660.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2770.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2822.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2906.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3059.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3084.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3192.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3271.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3378.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3469.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3572.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.84,"local_amount":5981.55,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6166.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680713},{"amount":31.26,"local_amount":2677.06,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2759.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625007},{"amount":34.49,"local_amount":2953.68,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3045.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194085},{"amount":69.29,"local_amount":5934.54,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6118.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261982},{"amount":220.12,"local_amount":18853.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":19437.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600256}],"funded_date":"2014-08-30T03:56:44Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":758196,"name":"Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Eduardo y su esposa viven en el municipio de Colomi, el se\u00f1or se dedica a la agricultura siembra en terreno de 3 Has herencia de sus padres, ya cuenta con bastante experiencia en el rubro, cultiva papa y papaliza, actualmente requiere un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de 1 cami\u00f3n de abono gallinaza y  productos agroqu\u00edmicos para la siembra del presente a\u00f1o, adem\u00e1s quiere comprar una cabeza de ganado vacuno, de esta forma tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de aumentar su producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y asegurar la seguridad alimentaria ya que es \u00e9poca de siembra de los cultivos agr\u00edcolas.","en":"Eduardo and his wife live in the town of Colmi.

A native of Chinandega in the western part of the country, she's known as a hard-working, responsible woman with desire for self-improvement. In her free time she enjoys spending quality time with her family. Due to a lack of financial resources she was unable to complete her schooling because she had no choice but to start working at a young age to help her parents with household expenses. Currently she's a micro-entrepreneur and manages her own business,  which consists of a tortilla shop where she makes a quintal and a half of tortillas every day. She also receives income from selling cooked beans, of which she makes thirty pounds a day. Her buying and selling is done in cash, and she started this business with her own money and capital when she saw the demand that there was at the time in her area because of the absence of tortilla shops nearby. The work day starts very early, first with washing the corn, then grinding it to start making delicious tortillas that she sells to regulars and occasional customers. One of her dreams is to be able to grow her business to have more income and profit so that her son can get a degree. This is why Eladia is requesting financing to invest in her business by purchasing ingredients such as: corn, firewood, lime, plastic bags, beans, garlic, among other things to grow her business and get better purchase prices from distributors, reducing expenses and increasing profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1677274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients for making tortillas and selling cooked beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-08-29T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-28T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eladia Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1291.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.69,"local_amount":1309.56,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1324.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542558060},{"amount":50.23,"local_amount":1297.49,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-18T10:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1312.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561690919},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":1307.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-23T10:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1322.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579618859},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":1305.97,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1320.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595205437},{"amount":50.51,"local_amount":1304.91,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-22T10:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610600732},{"amount":47.4,"local_amount":1224.31,"processed_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1238.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624460846},{"amount":104.26,"local_amount":2693.31,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2723.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636632091},{"amount":49.76,"local_amount":1285.55,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1300.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666521506},{"amount":145.98,"local_amount":3771.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3813.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681389999}],"funded_date":"2014-09-25T15:09:45Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T15:06:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manolo Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":759523,"name":"Good Hope Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelina, who is in her early 20s, is single.

Meet Evaline, a mother of four, from Litein, a remote village in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past 22 years of her life farming. She sells milk, tea, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business, to make ends meet.<br \/><br \/>Evaline is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient value. She is so keen and close with her cows, she has named one of them Teta.  Milking Teta makes Evaline very proud, and she feels fulfilled.<br \/><br \/>Dairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Evaline wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to grow with. She is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Evaline has planted Napier grass, and feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once she acquires the additional dairy cow. The exotic cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk selling will allow Evaline to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products, such as cream, yoghurt, and cheese. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that she will be able to start a biogas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs.<br \/><br \/>With your loan, all that Evaline dreams of is a secure future for her children.

at his 18 years of age he is planning to open his second branch selling ice cream. His parents have not even supported him financially. He achieved this because in his free time he worked and earned the money to start an ice cream store, and he was so successful that he now wants to expand to another neighborhood. Because he is young and of humble origin, he does not have enough resources. Even though he paid the whole refrigeration equipment himself, he now lacks the funds to promote his business with advertisement. He is requesting a loan to advertise his new point of sale.

She is married and has three children aged twenty-nine, twenty-seven and seventeen. In 2002, Finda established her garri and groundnut business. She began her business because she wanted to help in supporting her husband for a better welfare for their children. Her business is located in city center and her main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,020,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Finda requires a loan in order to buy additional bags of garri and groundnuts. She hopes that this loan can increase stock and raise income. In the future, Finda plans to own a factory that will be producing garri and a large portion of farm to grow groundnut.

They have an average of three children and all live in extended traditional families in Lafiabougou, one of the neighborhoods in the city of San\/Segou, in the fourth administrative region of the republic of Mali. These women met through kinship ties and run businesses selling condiments, cereals, vegetables, and soap.  After having fully repaid their previous loans, they are now on their second group loan.  Mamou, the woman standing second from left to right in the photo, plans to use her loan to buy 30 kg of rice, 5 kg of wheat flour, 5 kg of corn, 10 liters of oil, 5 kg of onions, and one half-package of Maggi cubes.

He was such a prolific salesman at his former employer, a major Mexican snack manufacturer, that his managers suggested he go into business on his own. With his connections in the industry, Cesar was able to quickly build up a client base that not only demands his products and is loyal to him, but that displays his products prominently near the cash register.\r\n\r\nFor Cesar, the problem since he started the business hasn\u2019t been the demand, but the supply. With a limited amount of funds available to start his business, Cesar needs credit to buy more inventory and pay the down payment on a used van he will use to distribute product to local retailers.

","en":"Mavluda is a kind and very hardworking 42-year-old woman.  She is married and the mother of one son and two daughters.   She lives with her family and hopes to raise her children well so that they become good people.  \r\n\r\nIn order to provide for her family, Mavluda runs her own business.  For the past seven years, she's been buying and selling first-necessity children's and men's clothes.  In the past, she only used to sell small items.  Over time, she also started to sell larger items and eventually added men's clothes to her inventory.  She buys her merchandise at a wholesale market and brings it herself from Istarvshan for resale.  She also buys clothes at a local wholesale market and resells in her own town.  Thanks to her business, she makes a decent and stable income.  \r\n\r\nMavluda now wants to expand her business and increase her assortment of various children's and men's clothes.  For this reason, she is taking a loan which will help her to buy more merchandise.  She has turned to Arvand to get this loan, and she is looking forward to a positive

region of Yavan. She is married. Her husband, as most men in Tajikistan, works in the Russian Federation. Zarina does not have children yet. She lives together with her mother, brother and sister. For three years, Zarina has been working as a seamstress. It was her mother who taught her to sew and cut. Her mother still advises Zarina in her work. Zarina is grateful to her mother because the income  from this work is beneficial for the household. At present Zarina uses the sewing machine you see in the photo. The sewing machine has become really obsolete, and Zarina would like to buy a new one but lacks the financial resources needed.
