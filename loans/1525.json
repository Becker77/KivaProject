West Java. Adam runs a small stall that sells groceries, mobile phone airtime credits, and utility bill payment services. He was introduced to Ruma by one of Ruma's staff who visited his stall and he quickly became interested in joining Ruma. Nowadays, he can process up to 40 transactions per day.

This gain was very helpful as the family's finances are currently experiencing difficult times due to increasingly expensive necessities of life.\r\n\r\nNi Ketut, along with the Sarwa Wiguna group, decided to continue loaning from MUK as this has been especially helpful in developing the pig business. Ni Ketut wants to increase her pig business by keeping pigs for a local pig barbecue. She needs a new loan to purchase three pigs and feed. She will also buy some merchandise for her canteen. The pigs, used in pigrolls, are usually only kept for 2-3 months and then are sold. Her husband supports her business by helping her feed the animals and clean the barn.

He has been operating a lathe machine for many years and can easily renew or manufacture the spare parts of various vehicles. His lathe machine is out of order and some tools have become worn out due to continuous use, which is why they need replacement. He has spent his all savings to buy cast iron for manufacturing spare parts and does not have cash in hand to fix the lathe machine.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Nargis has requested a loan for her husband so he can fix the deficiencies of the lathe machine and can buy new tools to work with the lathe machine. She is relaxed now, because her husband will be able to easily operate his lathe machine again.

Her husband owns a workshop in which he provides services to maintain bicycles. He is a professional in his techniques and can easily fix the bicycles in no time. He has to use various types of tools for repairing purposes. \r\nA few days ago he moved his workshop to another location. Due to relocating some of the important and expensive tools have been misplaced.\r\nSafia has requested a loan for her husband so that he would be able to compensate against this loss. He will buy repair tools, spare parts, tires, break shoes, etc. for the bicycle repair workshop. \r\nShe wants to provide better education and living standards to her children. She is hopeful that her husband will utilize this amount in a positive way and his monthly income will be increased.

friends, Chitra, Rajeswari, Sarasu, Chitra, Bhuvaneswari, Annakamu, and Jayalakshmi, formed a group called \u2018Parvatham\u2019. All hail from Valadi village of Trichy in Tamil Nadu. Most of them are daily-wage laborers and help supplement their household income. \r\n\r\nThese diligent women are unable to save money from their monthly income. A major chunk of their income goes towards buying firewood or kerosene, and a lot of their time is spent cooking over traditional \u2018chulha\u2019 stoves. These chulhas, apart from being time-consuming, also emit a lot of smoke, which plays havoc with their health. This adds to their medical expenses.\r\n\r\nTo tackle these problems, they have approached PAT (MicroGraam\u2019s field partner) to buy Greenway cookstoves. The benefits of the Greenway cookstove are that it leads to fuel savings, uses all solid fuels, minimizes emissions of CO and CO2, supports fast and convenient cooking, is highly durable, and is maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels, such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal, and dry dung, and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. \r\n\r\nHence, they are seeking a group loan of INR 1,400 each, which is repayable in easy installments. They intend to use the loan to purchase Greenway cookstoves. Your loan will help these women to have better health and also save a little more money.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1679968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a fuel-efficient cookstove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Trichy, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-08-30T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-29T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nesamary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chitra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chitra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajeswari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarasu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhuvaneswari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annakamu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayalakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":11200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-01T22:21:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":759971,"name":"Janety","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janety is a married woman.

All of them are working to help supplement their family income. These women, apart from working hard all day long, also need to labour in front of the traditional \u201cchulha\u201d stoves while cooking. These stoves emit a lot of smoke, which is a health hazard for the whole family and especially the women. Also, the families need to spend an average of Rs. 200 for the firewood and additional expenses towards medical needs.\r\n\r\nSo, Kavitha and her friends have approached People\u2019s Action for Transformation (PAT), MicroGraam\u2019s field partner, which promotes fuel-efficient cookstoves as part of their energy initiative. The benefits of the Greenway cookstove are fuel savings, using all solid fuels, minimized emissions of CO and CO2, fast and convenient cooking, and high durability; they are also maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels, such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal, and dry dung, and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost.\r\n\r\nIn order to buy these cookstoves, Kavitha (holding a board with the SHG group name) and her friends have formed the Valarpirai Self-Help Group and are seeking a group loan of INR 1,400 each, which is repayable in easy installments. Your loan will not only help these women in preventing respiratory diseases, but also help the environment. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1680007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a fuel-efficient cookstove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Tanjore, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-08-30T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-29T20:30:07Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kavitha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanthi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gayathridevi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shanthi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parimala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valarmathi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushatha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indhirani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malarkodi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":18200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":18200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-04T21:22:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":759982,"name":"Naheed's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naheed, 32, lives with her husband and four children in the area around Lahore.

Forty-year-old Chitra is a daily wage laborer, as are the other members of the group. They work long hours outside only to come back home and spend a lot of time cooking over traditional \u2018chulha\u2019 stoves that emit a lot of smoke that is detrimental to their health. The smoke affects the children at home too. Besides, there is always the danger of contracting respiratory ailments hovering over their heads.\r\n\r\nSo Chitra and her group have approached PAT, which is promoting cook stoves as part of their energy initiative with the financial support of Micrograam. The benefits of the Greenway cook stove are: fuel savings, using all solid fuels, minimized emissions of CO2, fast and convenient cooking, high durability, and they are maintenance free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. Due to all the above reasons, these cook stoves are preferred by the group.\r\n\r\nChitra and her group are, hence, seeking a loan of INR 1400 each, which is repayable in easy installments, to buy the Greenway cook stove.

preschool-aged children. She has a high school education and is calm, level-headed, and hardworking by nature. She raises livestock as her family's main source of income and started in the business nine years ago. Thanks to her hard work she currently has three cows, ten sheep, and a 0.17 hectare plot of land where she plants corn. She earns about 14,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to expand her business, Zhumagul applied for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) with the Bai-Tushum Bank to buy ten sheep. She is the leader of the \"Nurdan\" group, which has four other members.

As a main source of income for her family, Bakisa raises livestock, having launched this business in 1992 with a staring capital of 3,500 KGS. Thanks to Bakisa's hard work, her farm at present includes one cow, eight sheep, and one horse; there is also a landplot, where Bakisa and her family grow corn. Bakisa is one of the five members of the Nurdan group. In order to develop her business further, she has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 40,000 KGS to buy a cow for fattening. Bakisa plans to use the resulting revenue for a further expansion of her business.

Simon is 29 years of age and never wants to be left behind. \r\n\r\nBased in the rich Kisii highlands, he has been practicing mixed farming for the past 3 years. This loving and caring father of one earns a decent income through selling milk, eggs, and some personal business he engages in to make ends meet. Simon believes that to be a successful dairy farmer all he requires is a good breed of cow, quality feed, and advice from successful farmers. \r\n\r\nSince his childhood Simon has passionately loved dairy farming and this can be attested to the fact that he has nicknamed one of his cows \u201cNyarangi\u201d (from a person\u2019s name). Feeding and milking Nyarangi (the name of his cow) makes him very proud. \r\n\r\nDemand for milk in his area has been overwhelming and he has always wanted to buy another dairy cow to meet the demand. His biggest challenge is lack of funds to buy a quality breed of cow. Simon feels relieved that through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders he can access loans and be able to make his dream come true. \r\n\r\nSimon plans not to just buy an ordinary dairy cow but he plans to buy an exotic breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 15-25 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to increased income and profit margins. Feeding of the dairy cow will never be a problem because he has planted enough Napier grass. \r\n\r\nSimon is a visionary farmer and plans that through profits from selling milk he will save more so that he can increase his milk selling business through producing yoghurt and cream. Other than profits, Simon stands to benefit from manure, which will help increase the productivity of his farm. In the long run, Simon is going to increase his income and save more and also improve his living conditions. His dream is to provide a secure future for his school going child.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1680222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-08-31T02:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-30T02:00:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3789.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4561.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4749.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4838.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4982.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5245.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5287.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5472.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5608.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5947.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6124.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.16,"local_amount":9911.91,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10214.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680715},{"amount":53.27,"local_amount":4584.89,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4725.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625009},{"amount":58.8,"local_amount":5061.26,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5215.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194087},{"amount":121.36,"local_amount":10445.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10764.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261984},{"amount":376.41,"local_amount":32396.6,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":33386.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600258}],"funded_date":"2014-09-29T19:18:12Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Narindra-Dastoor","image":153719}},{"id":760091,"name":"Narine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narine lives with her family in the village of Khotanan in the Syunik region.

He didn't get an education since at the time his parents didn't see school as a priority.  His wife is a housewife.  They have five children who all live in their house and depend on them financially.  The children are making every effort in school and also work in their free time.\r\n\r\nMore than 10 years ago, Santos learned from a friend how to work at welding.   Seeing there is high demand for this in his area and a scarcity of capable people has led Santos to decide to form his own small workshop.   Besides this,he works at farming with his children's help at times when he's not busy in the shop.  Every day he works hard trying to develop his family and be able to improve their quality of life little by little.  With the loan he is seeking, Santos will buy chemicals, iron, paint and equipment to improve his shop and do some jobs that people have sought.  He has lacked the necessary materials to do that work, and could thus offer better service, and one of higher quality.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Santos hopes to have a workshop offering a wide variety of services so that people wont have to go to another place to get some jobs done, and he can take advantage of the chance to earn more.  He hopes his children will prepare themselves academically and learn to work so they can help him improve the house where they live, and that they will all be happy to live in a beautiful place.  He is sure that through his work and the help of his family they will get ahead in life.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1678169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":" to buy chemicals, metal, paints and equipment to improve his shop and carry out work that customers have asked for","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-31T02:50:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-30T02:50:26Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":213.98},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":236.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":261.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":288.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.98},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":214.93,"local_amount":214.93,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":214.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545217},{"amount":785.07,"local_amount":785.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":785.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146486}],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T12:22:51Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":760120,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida is a 48-year-old married lady living with her family.

She did not have the opportunity to attend school, as her parents did not have the resources necessary to send her. In addition, the school was located far away, and there were problems related to the armed conflict that was underway; this limited her ability to get an education.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is married, and her husband works in agriculture. They have three children, but none of them live with her, as they have already formed their own families. Only three grandchildren live with her and depend on her economically.\r\n\r\nSince she was little, Mar\u00eda learned from her mother how to sell meat from butchering cattle and pigs. For now, this is her economic activity; she has been doing this for 15 years. It is fairly profitable and since it's a food product, people consume quite a bit of it, so her sales are brisk.\r\n\r\nHer husband helps her get the animal that they are going to butcher and deliver the orders, which they do once a week.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting is to buy a pig to butcher and sell, seeking earnings to improve her family's quality of life; this way she won't miss the opportunity to do business. People already know which days they have the product for sale and they always come looking for it, so she misses out on earnings when she doesn't have it.\r\n\r\nShe would like for her three grandchildren to be academically prepared so that they can enjoy the opportunities that she did not have, and for their living conditions to be better. She is also planning to improve her residence and continue working in order to keep earning income that will help defray the costs of household necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1678181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a pig to butcher and sell, seeking earnings to improve her family's quality of life","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-08-31T03:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-30T03:00:06Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":22.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":23.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.94,"local_amount":22.94,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":22.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542501690},{"amount":21.5,"local_amount":21.5,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":21.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420488},{"amount":22.24,"local_amount":22.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":22.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545218},{"amount":26.05,"local_amount":26.05,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":26.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145595},{"amount":207.27,"local_amount":207.27,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":207.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769162}],"funded_date":"2014-09-07T02:30:53Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":760140,"name":"Fehmeeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fehmeeda is a 45-year-old married woman who lives in Rawalpindi with her family.

Yasamin believes that this business will be very successful and profitable for her and for her brother, and that she can earn a lot of money. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Yasamin doesn't have enough money to purchase the minibus. As a result, she applied for loan of 500,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase a minibus and make this business another income source for her family. \r\n\r\nYasamin looks forward to providing her

Meet Lucy, one of the most hardworking and dedicated women on planet earth. She is based in Kirere, a remote village in the Thika area of Kenya. She is happily married to Joshua, who adds additional income to support their family. They are blessed with four lovely children. For the past 12 years she has been engaging in mixed farming and through selling milk, tea and a variety of food crops she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. Although Lucy makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Lucy comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity\u201d. Being 59 years of age, she faces challenges carrying water on her back because of her failing health and she is quickly aging. Lucy is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain fed agriculture but Lucy wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan she intends to harvest rain water which always goes to waste and store it in the tanks. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan Lucy will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boast productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops.<br \/><br \/>Lucy is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. She will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children. Lucy\u2019s hope for the future is to live a fulfilling

All hail from Keelarasur village of Trichy in Tamil Nadu. Most of them are daily-wage laborers and help supplement their household income. These diligent women are unable to save money from their monthly income. A major chunk of their income goes towards buying firewood or kerosene, and a lot of their time is spent cooking over traditional \"chulha\" stoves. These chulhas, apart from being time consuming, also emit a lot of smoke, which plays havoc with their health. This adds to their medical expenses.\r\n\r\nHence, to tackle these problems, they have approached PAT (MicroGraam\u2019s field partner) to buy Greenway cookstoves. The benefits of a Greenway cook stove are that it leads to fuel savings, uses all solid fuels, minimizes emissions of CO and CO2, supports fast and convenient cooking, and is highly durable, maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. Hence, they are seeking a group loan of INR 1400 each to buy the stoves, which is repayable in easy installments. They intend to use the loan to purchase Greenway cookstoves. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help these women to have better health and also save a little more money.     \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1680167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a smokeless stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Trichy, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-08-31T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-09-30T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dhanakodi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saroja ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nagarethinam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Uma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vasantha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanapakkiyam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaliyammal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalaiselvi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nallammal ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maruthayee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-02T09:45:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":760166,"name":"Jhuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jhuma is a 22-year-old married lady, with one toddler. She is originally from a remote village, Tekatuli in Maynaguri in the district of Jalpaiguri. She is only 22 years old and known for being hard-working and responsible, with a great desire for personal achievement. Due to  lack of economic resources and because of the poverty in which she lived, she did not get the opportunity of higher study and attended school till grade 9; after that, she got married.\r\n\r\nJhuma's husband, Pradip, handles his own business of selling fruits. He runs a small store in his home where he sells fruits like bananas, mangoes, watermelon, oranges, apples and other seasonal fruits.  He makes his purchases for cash from the markets and distributors in his area. His sales are for cash. He has regular and occasional customers. He began his business many years ago with his own funds and with the goal of helping with the expenses of his household. Today, it is the only source of income for his household.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is to be able to make an increase in the inventory in his business.

The founder of the company, Robert, has been in the jewelry business for 30 years now, manufacturing jewelry cleaner for 12 years.  If someone ever goes to a jewelry store, and they have a spray cleaner with their name on it, it\u2019s probably Robert's. He began when one day, when he was working at a retail jewelry store. Someone brought in a diamond ring that had to be over 100 years old, and she couldn\u2019t clean it. Robert tried and couldn\u2019t clean it either, until he noticed that the diamond had a white coating. No jewelry cleaner has a hard water remover, so he mixed some up and voila; \u201cBrilliant Diamond Cleaner\u201d was born. A few years later in 2006, his company was the first jewelry cleaner picked for the Oscars Gift Bags.\r\n\r\nThe Company had an amazing run until the economic crash of 2008, when 1\/3 of Robert\u2019s jewelry store clients went out of business. Sales plummeted, but it taught him the lesson of being \u201cnimble\u201d in business-to control his costs with vendors.   \r\n\r\nKiva is helping Robert by eliminating outsourcing a cost for his product with an equipment purchase. And as Robert has often found, this cost savings allows him more flexibility in sales to try new pricing and marketing campaigns.  And even if his sales remain flat from last year, a 15% reduction in costs is just like a 30% increase in sales!

Meet Peter, 60 years of age and one of the most dedicated farmers in his rural town of Thika. He is happily married and blessed with 3 lovely school-going children. He is the bread winner in his family since his wife has no formal job. Through milk, eggs, tea and a variety of food crop he has been able to earn a decent income. Of all the activities he is involved in dairy farming is close to his heart. He passionately loves dairy farming and to prove this he has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201ckairu\u201d. Feeding his cows is his hobby. Waking up every day in the morning to milk his cows makes him feel fulfilled. To increase productivity of his dairy cows from the current 5-10 litres a day to 15-25 litres a day he needs to properly feed his cows and this is the only secret to success. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting for a loan to buy a chaff cutter. The importance of a chaff cutter is to cut hay and straw into small pieces before mixing it with forage to feed the cows.

She is 26 and has two children, and she formed this group to help the women in her village improve their livelihoods so they can better support their families. Together, the women in the group live in a small village in the coastal region of Odisha, a state in Eastern India. Most of the women either raise fish, work in dairy farming, or operate small individual businesses in the village. \r\n\r\nLili will use a portion of her group's 150,000 rupee loan to expand her fishery. Specifically, she will buy fish food and baby fish to raise in a pond near her house.

Her ambition was to open a second restaurant in the Bound Brook area that would allow her to tap into the Central American market in that area, but she also expected to attract the attention of other cultures as well.

","en":"Nuriniso is a hardworking woman who has been working her own land diligently for a long time. 20 years ago she started her business growing crops, primarily onions. She started the business at a time when she really needed the money, since they lived in poverty and she had four children to care for. Therefore she rented land and started to grow vegetables. She gradually developed her business, first selling vegetables direct to customers at the local market, and now she sells to wholesale buyers who come to her. She is thankful to her husband for helping and supporting her in this business for all these years. Nuriniso plans to do a second planting of onions and therefore is requesting a loan of 5,000 somoni to buy seeds and mineral fertilizers. She awaits your
