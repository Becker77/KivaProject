everything her family needed, since her husband's income from his barber shop wasn't enough to cover living expenses. She is raising four children and is their light and hope. Seven years ago she started her own business buying and selling clothing at the local market, where she has her own retail stall. She sells primarily women's clothing, since the demand for it is higher than for men's or children's clothing. She needs to bring in new inventory for the new season to attract more customers, since she needs to bring in more income to care for her children. She is requesting a loan of 7,500 somoni to buy women's clothing for the new season. She awaits your kindness and hopes for your charity. She dreams that her children will become educated people.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1679323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

is 64, married, and has two school-age children. He raises livestock as his family's main source of income, which he began in 1995 with 7,000 som (KGS). Thanks to his hard work, Rapitbai currently has a horse, three cows, and ten sheep, along with a 1.44 hectare plot of land where he plants alfalfa and fruit trees. In order to expand his business he applied for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to purchase sheep.

The only thing she is lacking is the money to buy the cattle and therefore she is looking for a loan. In her words, one of her sons will help her with the business. The older son is working in Russia with his father, and the other son works at a microcredit organization. Bozorgul says that she has experience taking care of livestock and therefore she won't have any difficulties with the new business.

But thanks to the loan he got from ADICLA, he has been able to improve these living conditions.\r\n\r\nWith this second loan, he will buy a lot of land that is offered for sale.

This pigs business has been shown to supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nBecause Ni Made already has a sow, she will use the loan to buy two superior piglets for fattening and a superior quality of feed so her pigs can grow fast.

He has been raising livestock for a long time and has many cows. Every morning he and his family milk the cows and sell the milk at the market. The milk sells out quickly. Azamatjon also buys and sells cows, and of course his children help him with the business. His family is very close-knit and the children were brought up well.

An amount of PHP 24,000 could already help her in the renovation and beautification of their place so that they could attract more boarders. She will also utilize the loan to add to the capital needed for her buy-and-sell business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rebecca hopes to prosper and succeed in her business through all her hard work. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1610513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the repair and maintenance of her room for rent.

She has been raising livestock for a long time and has a small farm with a few head of cows. She milks them every day and sells the milk. Satkiniso fattens cattle, sells them at the market, and then uses the money to buy a young cow. She and her husband have experience fattening cattle and feed them heavily with special formula feed and supplements so that they quickly gain weight, as her customers mainly purchase cows for meat. Satkiniso applied for financial support with MDO Arvand because she does not want to be financially dependent on her spouse and children. She wants to run the business herself, though her husband, children, and grandchildren support and help her. Satkiniso hopes that MDO Arvand will respond to her request for help and give her a

Her business is selling jewelry by catalog. She is enterprising, tenacious, responsible and very hardworking. She works using a series of sales catalogs to sell door to door in the southern area of her city. This is a historical and very symbolic area, because the battle of the Independence of Bolivia fought by the brave Bolivian women \"Heroines of the Coronilla\", the most sublime defense of the liberty against the Spanish army in 1812, was fought here. Viviana is of dark skin, long brown hair, medium height. Her wish of meeting up her goals has made her join a group with similar needs in order to request a loan and continue with her enterprise (Viviana is standing at the right side of the photo wearing a red sweater). She works as a street vendor, visiting her customers, offices, acquaintances, etc. and showing them her catalogs. She dreams of having a big store to sell jewelry and improve the quality of life of her three children through the catalog purchase of jewelry to exhibit and sell. These are Viviana's reasons to request a loan in order to buy work material and improve the quality of life of her three children.

It comprises distinctive and hardworking women members who hail from Rohini, a small village in the Deoghar district of Jharkhand. These members, who run various small businesses, have collectively approached MESP (Micrograam\u2019s field partner) for a loan of Rs. 53,000. \r\n\r\nMemun\u2019s husband does a construction material trading business; he has been doing this business for the last 10 years. He even has a small brick manufacturing unit. Memun has three sons and two daughters. Her two sons are working as painters, the younger son is working as a plumber, the elder daughter has been married, and the youngest daughter is going to school. The family income is not sufficient to meet the family expenses, so Memun planned to take a loan from Kiva to invest in her husband\u2019s business, which will help her to increase her family's monthly income.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members need the amount to improve their livelihoods. All of these members have been running their own businesses for a long time now.

and cheerful young man.  He is married, but doesn't have children yet, and so pours all of his efforts into his work.  Akmal lives with his wife in a small home in a rural village.  In order to provide for his family, he runs his own business of dekhan farming and animal husbandry.  He has a plot of land, a small part of which is rain-fed, while the rest is irrigated.  On this plot of land Akmal raises carrots, potatoes, and grain.  He also works at a mill.  His wife helps him to look after and raise the cattle.  Because their plot of land is large, they also graze their cattle on it.

His band performs at weddings and other special events on the weekends.  On days when he is not performing, Fahriddin runs his own grocery store.  He successfully combines these different careers.  Fahriddin is married and has a 4 year-old child.  His mother also lives with him.  Fahriddin is a talented singer - he inherited this ability from his father.  Fahriddin now wants to expand his music career, and is asking for a loan to purchase the mixer amplifier Dynacord PowerMate.  This device is not cheap, but its cost is fully justified by the quality of sound it produces, its reliability, and its versatility.  For this reason Fahriddien really hopes to purchase this device.

","en":"Tursunoy lives with her family in a remote area, far from the city, among the tall Tajik mountains.  Tursunoy was born in 1985.  She is married and has 2 children, who are 3 and 5 years old.  Her husband is a construction worker.  Tursunoy works in animal husbandry and raises primarily small-horned cattle.  Tursunoy fattens sheep for several months and then sells them at the local market.  She has been working in this business for over 4 years.  Her husband helps her to run the business.  She wants to increase her working capital and her income, and is thus asking for a loan of 7500 TJS to purchase small-horned cattle.  With the income she receives she will improve the living conditions of her children.  She awaits your kindness and is relying on your charity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1115.76,"image":{"id":1681201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Dilbar is a kind and hard-working woman of 40.  Because of her family's circumstances her personal life didn't work out, and she got divorced.  After her unlucky marriage, she didn't remarry, and has no children.  Despite all this, she loves her nephews and with love raises them and spends all her free time with them.  Dilbar is a vendor at the market, and sells Tajik cakes.  Dilbar ferries these cakes from the city, but when there are many orders she bakes them herself at home.  She really enjoys her work.  Demand for the Tajik cakes grows day by day, and Dilbar's clientele is multiplying with the demand.  Especially in summer, when weddings are frequent, demand is high almost every day.  Because of this, Dilbar hopes to multiply the number of sales of cakes, but lacks sufficient funds to support such high turnover.  For this reason she turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase items to make cakes.  She is relying on the support of the organization and in advance expresses her gratitude to Arvand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1679120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

a positive and hardworking woman of 35.  She is married and has four children, and lives in a small rural village.  From childhood Kurbonbi has dreamed of becoming a teacher, but due to her family's poor financial circumstances, was unable to receive a higher education.  Immediately after finishing her secondary education, Kurbonbi married and became a housewife.  Despite the fact that she is always home, she is always doing something.  She and her husband strive to do everything possible to provide their children with every necessity.  In order to have constant income to provide for their family, Kurbonbi and her husband started their own business working in animal husbandry.  Kurbonbi raises cattle and sells their milk and meat.  This work provides her with a good income.  Kurbonbi's husband also works in the local repair shop, and his work provides additional income for the family.  Their combined income is sufficient to provide an average standard of living, and as of yet they have enough funds to cover all of their needs.  Kurbonbi and her husband now hope to purchase a few more head of cattle for fattening, and this reason she turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase cattle.  Kurbonbi thanks Arvand in advance for its support, the result of which will help increase her family's quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1674108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T02:30:06Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kurbonbi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":202.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":206.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":223.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":227.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":230.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":243.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":255.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":255.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":270.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":278.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":286.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":320.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.27,"local_amount":202.91,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T15:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":210.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542562319},{"amount":582.73,"local_amount":2797.09,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-22T10:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2901.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695006}],"funded_date":"2014-09-01T15:31:48Z","paid_date":"2014-11-22T10:30:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":760652,"name":"Shumila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shumaila is a 31-year-old housewife who has two children.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 700 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMaria is taking out a 10,000 PHP loan to buy additional vegetables, fish, fresh pork, dried food and frozen products and orders for her customers. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more frozen and fresh foods which are necessary to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to expand her business, and to send all of her children to school to give them the best education she can afford. She also dreams of having their own house and lot. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and it is there where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband is a polite and responsible person; he has many loyal customers. Since they have a big family it is getting difficult for her husband to fulfill their requirements and meet their daily expenses.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this situation, her husband has decided to buy more stock to increase sales and get more earnings. But due to lack of money, Muneera has requested a loan through Brac Pakistan to help her husband get the necessary financing. Her husband wants to expand his business in the

poultry products. Joseph practices mixed farming, growing bananas, tea and a variety of food crops. Of all the activities in which he is involved, poultry farming is closest to his heart. Waking up every morning to collect eggs makes him very proud. Feeding his poultry is his hobby.\r\n\r\nJoseph has always wanted to increase his poultry farming operation because the demand is overwhelming, but the biggest challenge has been lack of capital. Joseph has traits of a mobilizer, and he decided to mobilize other small scale farmers who share this common problem. Together, they joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that uses a co-guarantee mechanism to provide agricultural-based loans. Joseph is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. With the loan, he will be able to buy more poultry and satisfy the overwhelming demand.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan he will significantly increase his sales and this will translate to more profits. Demand for chicken is high in Thika; it is a popular meal for many people, and fast food joints are always full. Increased profits will allow Joseph to improve his living conditions and get out of the poverty-stricken situation he is currently in. Other than profits, he will also benefit from poultry manure, which has higher nitrogen than other livestock manure.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Joseph sees a brighter future. He awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":696.36,"image":{"id":1680978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T03:10:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4622.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4697.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4837.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5128.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5134.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5326.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5446.07},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5636.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5776.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5948.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6137.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6308.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.23,"local_amount":10073,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":10309.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194090},{"amount":113.08,"local_amount":9800.35,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10030.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261987},{"amount":120.38,"local_amount":10433.25,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10677.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600261},{"amount":125.02,"local_amount":11283.05,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":11547.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.17,"payment_id":681377120},{"amount":61.04,"local_amount":5712.74,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5846.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.88,"payment_id":711505182},{"amount":73.11,"local_amount":6702.86,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6860.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.23,"payment_id":731022084},{"amount":69.66,"local_amount":6345.72,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6494.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.56,"payment_id":752110437}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T23:30:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":760696,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a 46-year-old farmer from Kyenzigye, Uganda.

hardworking 39-year-old man.  He is married and the father of four children.  He contacted MDO Arvand when he heard of the possibility of receiving financial support.  Khusan lives with his family in a rural area.  He has a secondary education.  However, he couldn't attend university because of his family's difficult financial situation.  Khusan's wife did not receive any education either.  She is a homemaker, taking care of the house and raising the children.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide for his family, Khusan runs his own animal husbandry business, feeding and selling cattle.  Khusan also works on a dekhan farm doing farm work, an activity from which he derives a good income.  Khusan's wife helps him with the family business by selling the milk they get from their cows.  Khusan now wants to increase his cattle headcount in order to expand his business.  For this reason he has turned to MDO Arvand and applied for a loan which will allow him to buy some cattle.  Khusan is really hoping for a positive outcome, and thanks MDO Arvand in advance for all their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1674094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 60 years old, married, and has three grown children.  Sra. Mar\u00eda has been selling used clothes, for both women and men, at a small market for the past four years.  Every day her goal is to get ahead.  As a result of her efforts, Sra. Mar\u00eda has been able to make improvements to her home with the help of her husband.  She has also been able to improve her business.  Her greatest wish is to see her children become professionals.  For this reason, Sra. Mar\u00eda works very hard.  <br \/><br \/>The loan that has been issued to her will be used to buy more clothes for eventual resale.  This will help her to generate more income.  In the photo, Sra. Mar\u00eda is wearing a green sweater and a black vest.  She bids farewell with a hug to Kiva and EDAPROSPO because she is grateful for this loan that makes it possible for her to progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":1678246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Vitarte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.033333 -76.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T05:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":3025,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estefany Milagros ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel Soledad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katya Magaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sonia Suhey ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":756.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2136.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542509138},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2136.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561642559},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2136.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579553055},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2136.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595153618}],"funded_date":"2014-09-01T10:58:29Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:27:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":760716,"name":"Rodelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodelyn has been operating her own transportation-service-based business for more than a year, and she earns well from this.

Yet another time, Saodat obtained a loan to expand and improve her business. The demand for national spices and jars increases among local residents during the canning season because everyone is getting ready for the winter during the summer time. Saodat, of course, wants to earn some income from sales during the season, and use this money to help her son and add her contribution to her grandson's wedding; they decided to do a circumcision for him this year.\r\n\r\nShe buys merchandise wholesale and delivers it from a city and sells it retail at a local market. Saodat has a lot of experience in this area. She sells merchandise seasonally and according to local residents' demand. Thanks to her small business, Saodat improved her family life and helps her grandsons with obtaining education. While the season is hot, Saodat wants to bring in more jars and goods for canning, but does not have enough money to buy merchandise, and this is why she decided to obtain a loan again. Saodat is very happy that such organizations that provide timely financial help and support starting entrepreneurs exist in our countries.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1679221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy jars and supplies for canning","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":69.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saodat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":349.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":355.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":379.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":385.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":390.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":408.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":420.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":429.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":448.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":456.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":468.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":507.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":144.59,"local_amount":705.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-22T10:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":719.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695007},{"amount":77.7,"local_amount":379.02,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":386.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626786},{"amount":79.1,"local_amount":385.84,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":393.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209264},{"amount":79.99,"local_amount":390.19,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":398.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752235},{"amount":82.93,"local_amount":408.26,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":416.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.76,"payment_id":624277489},{"amount":78.18,"local_amount":420.06,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":428.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.93,"payment_id":636634904},{"amount":412.79,"local_amount":2311.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2358.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.03,"payment_id":649616236}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T18:16:39Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":757677,"name":"Melchora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He also engages in transportation services and with his motorbike, he makes some extra income transporting his neighbors and their farm produce. One of the best activities that Martin enjoys doing is crop farming and he is determined to expand his farming activities, though his biggest challenge remains poor productivity. \r\n\r\nMartin is seeking a loan from Kiva through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase farm implements. Small-scale farmers like Martin cannot get formal financing from banks because of the irregular income and lack of collateral. But with Juhudi Kilimo, it\u2019s a different ball game. They see potential in farmers that not every organization can see. Through the loan, he will buy good quality fertilizer and good seeds that will boost his productivity. An increase in productivity will result in increased income and increased profit margins. The loan will allow permanent change in Martin's life and he will be able to improve his living conditions. Martin's dream is to secure the future of his child and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1681112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T09:00:01Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":910.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1096.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1141.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1163.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1260.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1271.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1315.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1348.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1392.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1429.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1472.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.63},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.71},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.47,"local_amount":2183.44,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2251.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680718},{"amount":17.37,"local_amount":1489.17,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625012},{"amount":15.11,"local_amount":1295.26,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1335.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194091},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":2637.47,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2720.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261988},{"amount":33.11,"local_amount":2838.28,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2927.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600262},{"amount":50.88,"local_amount":4556.38,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4699.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":681377121}],"funded_date":"2014-09-01T13:09:53Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":760756,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is 35 years old and a resident of Ntinda, a suburb of Wakiso.

He works every day from 7am until 4pm.\r\n\r\nPedro is applying for a loan from CrediCampo and will use it to buy building materials, such as metal sheeting and wood, in order to build an extension on his home. This will make his family a little more comfortable as the house where they live is very small.\r\n\r\nPedro's dream is to give his children enough education so that they may have a profession, have a good job and move forward in life. He also wants to buy a motorcycle for travelling to work."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1679469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials, such as metal sheeting and wood, in order to build an extension on his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Amilcar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":22.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":24.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":23.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":29.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":29.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":29.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":34.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":52.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":759583,"name":"Henry Jair","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Henry de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, es pescador artesanal, estudi\u00f3 hasta el 7\u00b0 grado, por la econom\u00eda no pudo continuar sus estudios.

Her family consists of her husband, her two sons, her daughter-in-law and little grandson. \r\n\r\nTamara works in the village school as an cleaner. Her husband works in a private company as a driver and her two sons are constructors.  However, the low salaries are not enough to meet the basic needs of their family. Tamara and her husband are involved in farming as well. This is an important source of income for them. They grow strawberries and keep livestock of calves, cow and hens. Tamara's husband helps her to sell the fruit in the local market. \r\n\r\nAs life gets more expensive day by day, Tamara wants to find new sources of income. A loan of $2,500 USD will help her to buy an ox, forage for feeding the livestock and fertilizer for land cultivation.\r\n\r\nTamara had already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Tamara and her family were able to find a job and run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the monthly payments.
