Meet Joseph, one of the most dedicated and hardworking farmers from Thika, Kenya. He has been doing agriculture for 5 years now. He makes money selling produce from his farm which includes milk, eggs, and crops. He enjoys plowing his farm and watering his plants. Crop diseases pose a big challenge for him and also poor productivity. \r\n\r\nJoseph is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan he plans to buy good quality seeds and fertilizer which will help in increasing soil fertility and productivity on his farm.

the group with her hand raised, is skilled in weaving and devotes most of her time to weaving different types of traditional shawls to generate income. She lives in a very remote village called Phaijang which is a 45-minute drive from Imphal, Manipur. Their family includes the mother, father, and three school-going children. \r\n\r\nShe considers education a key to achieve one\u2019s aim in life and had been giving her best effort to give the best to her children to excel in their education. As the area faces insufficient power supply, their daily duties are affected after dusk, especially the study hours of the children after sunset. After buying the mini solar home lighting system, the children are able to study in comfort after dusk and for longer period with better concentration. Their academic performance is much better now which is the reason for availing the loan. \r\n\r\nWhile the children study under the solar home lighting, the mother does the household chores and weaves in comfort. Her weaving hours were limited before, but now she can weave in the evening and increase her production. The family is very happy to receive such a loan and thanks WSDS for lending such a loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1672870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy mini-solar home lighting system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T15:50:06Z","loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veikhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaipineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenghat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lamhat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhaineineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veichin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lhingneo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":133903,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133903}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-17T22:58:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":760868,"name":"Twesigangane Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fred is a hardworking Ugandan  single man living in Kagadi.

She makes delicious \"gol gappy,\" a popular street food in Pakistan.  It consists of a round, hollow puri, fried crisp and filled with a mixture of flavored water (\"pani\"), tamarind chutney, potato, onion and chickpeas. It is generally small enough to fit completely into one's mouth.\r\n\r\nShagufta has worked hard to gain popularity and recognition within her town.

She has a business selling dishes that are traditional to this area (Cochabamba) of Bolivia.  She is enterprising, active, tenacious, strong, firm, responsible, and very hardworking.  She carries out her business in Cochabamba, located in the geographic center of the country that borders six of the other eight Bolivian departments.  The Incas gave it this name, a combination of the words \u201cQocha\u201d and \u201cPampa\u201d, which mean lake and plain.  The name alludes to the abundance of water and the soft flattened hills that characterize the region.  The Spanish conquistadores, in order to maintain the custom of adapting all of the dialects, came to pronounce the town as Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nErika's life dream was to have a big and stable business.  To start her business she formed a communal bank with people of similar needs and businesses to request a loan to achieve her goals.  (She is the first from the right, wearing a striped beige shirt).  She has a dark complexion, long dark hair styled fashionably, and a medium stature.  Her native language is Quechua (which is the most common where she lives), and she uses Spanish for business.  She has a business selling traditional Cochabamban dishes.

Meet Leah.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea. \r\n\r\nLeah has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as for fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Leah remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nLeah is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Leah will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her is timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better quality produce and more yields. \r\n\r\nThis loan will support Leah\u2019s economic activity, and will change her family\u2019s living standards indirectly.

She is characterized as a very hard-working, responsible woman with a lot of desire to improve herself.  For lack of economic resources she couldn't finish her schooling since she got pregnant and had to work to get ahead. These days she fights day by day to offer a better future to her children. She is a small businesswoman and runs her own businesses which are a tailoring shop where she makes a variety of clothing, children's outfits, shorts, skirts, and dresses, and she also does repairs.  She also has a small bookshop where she offers school supplies such as notebooks, pencils, erasers, poster board, crayons, markers, folders, chart paper, and also she has a copying service, and in addition she sells natural drinks, juices, soft drinks, candies, among other things. She makes her purchases in markets and wholesalers in the area and her sales are all in cash. She has regular customers and occasional customers. One of her dreams is to be able to see her children all become professionals, and improve her house to expand her business. Tania is asking for another loan to invest in working capital and in the purchase of raw materials such as thread, needles, lace, buttons, zippers, and school supplies among other things and, in this way, fill the various orders she has.  Tania is grateful for the help that the Kiva lenders offer people of limited resources and in poor countries like Nicaragua to have a dignified means of work. \r\n\r\n

Meet Tom a young farmer from Kericho County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. Tom is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which he has been practicing mixed farming for the past 5 years. His primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and some variety of crops he plants. He also engages in some personal business to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nTom passionately loves farming and he says that he got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security that remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Kericho and Africa as a whole. From farming, he has been able to earn a decent income and he attributes all this success to hardwork and determination. Although he makes profits, he has always wanted to increase his farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge he has been facing is lack of funds. He is seeking a loan to buy cereals.\r\n\r\nDemand for cereals is overwhelming in Kericho and through your loan, he intends to buy different varieties of cereals and be able to satisfy the demand in his village and local market. With your loan, Tom will improve his living conditions through increased profits from selling cereals.\r\n\r\nTom has been practicing agriculture with a difference employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge attained through training from Juhudi Kilimo and he believes that his cereal-selling business will increase in leaps and bounds. There is no doubt that through your loan Tom's life is permanently going to change and he will assure his school-going children a secure future.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1681320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-01T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-01T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3820.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4017.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4054.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4174.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4512.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4433.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4628},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4703.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4897},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4989.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5137.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5330.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5449.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5640.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5780.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5952.29},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6165.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6313.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":759677,"name":"Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santiago un joven de 25 a\u00f1os de edad quien gracias a su madre que le facilito un espacio logro montar un negocio donde distribuye bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas y comida b\u00e1sicamente para eventos especiales del sector siendo una de las pocas fami-empresas dedicadas a esta labor en su zona residencial de Girardot \n\nSiendo muy joven opto por independizarse pues conseguir trabajo se tornada muy dif\u00edcil y los que consegu\u00eda era en condiciones p\u00e9simas, trabajando muchas horas por un bajo jornal y gracia a su madre ha sabido mejorar su calidad de vida y apoyar incondicionalmente a sus padres.\n\nSolicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de cervezas y licores de la regi\u00f3n como lo es el aguardiente  y tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1 en insumos para realizar los banquetes que le piden para los eventos. \n\nPara Santiago el apoyo que puedan recibir es muy importante pues podr\u00e1 crecer y generar empleos brindando un servicio \u00f3ptimo y eficiente que logre un objetivo de permanecer en el mercado y ser l\u00edderes en el mercado. \n","en":"Santiago is a young man of 25.

Her business is raising rabbits, chickens, and ducks which she then sells. She is enterprising, enthusiastic, communicative, strong, determined, persistent, responsible, and very hardworking. She works in the community of Sacaba, which is 14 kilometers away from the city of Cochabamba. The altitude is between 2,620 and 4,520 meters above sea level. Many farmers from the tropics have a residence in this municipality. They use these residences when they take their products from the tropics to sell in the city.\r\n\r\nFortunata has tanned skin and long black hair. She is of average height. Her native language is Quechua, which she uses to communicate in her social environment. In the city, she uses Spanish for business. \r\n\r\nIn her business, she has a chicken coop for both chickens and hens. The ducks are beside a river and the rabbits are in a wooden room. Even though the chickens are aggressive, they do not hurt any other animals on the farm. The qualities of rabbits include the quality of their meat and their ability to adapt to different materials.

He has to feed the calves for one or two years until they have grown up and are healthy, which is very lengthy and an expensive procedure. He also sells buffaloes as well. He buys buffaloes at a low price and sells them to the people for a profitable price.\r\n\r\nHe has been producing milk and breeding from the buffaloes. His production of milk and the breeding procedure have been affected because he is unable to cope with the demand. \r\n\r\nZafar wants to buy a buffalo to keep his income and his business constant, but he has already invested his all savings into miscellaneous expenses of the dairy farm. He does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy a buffalo to continue his business smoothly. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Zafar requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so he would be able to purchase a new buffalo for his business. He hopes that lenders will support him and this loan will prove productive for his business as well.\r\n\r\nHe is very impressed with the Kiva loan cycle system; he is thankful to the lenders.

","en":"Dilafruz is a cheerful woman. She helped her mother take care of the family from a young age, since her father died young. Her mother brought up four children on her own. After her own marriage, Dilafruz had to work hard to earn money to support her family. Her husband was a migrant worker in Russia for many years. He returned to his native land a few years ago and began raising livestock. Her husband's parents live with them and her mother-in-law is ill.

He is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in clinical laboratory science at the university.\r\n\r\nDora makes a living working in agriculture with her husband, but, for the most part, she takes care of broiler chickens. She has about eight years of experience working with chickens. She learned how to take care of them because she has always liked poultry. One day she decided to ask for technical advice to improve her profits, and this is how she acquired more experience in that area. The chickens are a short distance from home, and she spends the whole day taking care of them. Prior to this, she and her husband used to produce \"dulce de atado\" [blocks of solidified sugarcane honey wrapped in corn husks and tied with natural fiber rope], which was made from the sugarcane they used to plant. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers and herbicides, and pay for labor to help her do all the farm work required to grow her crops. This will result in higher yields, which will help improve their living conditions. The loan will be helpful because she says that without it she would not be able to buy everything she needs for the crops. \r\n\r\nDora's dream is to regrow the parcel of sugarcane that she used to have with the family. One of her children, who lives in the United States, is willing to help her regrow the sugarcane plantation because the harvest used to serve a double purpose: to produce the \"dulce\" but also to be used as livestock feed, which provided them with income for their household expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1678111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fertilizers and herbicides, and pay for labor to help her do all the farm work required to grow her crops.

She is 30 years old and currently resides with her husband, Ryan, in Cavite, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for two years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner have to work hard and are determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Maria Fe would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 25,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely sends you her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance, in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Maria Fe hopes for her business to grow bigger and bigger. She dreams of improving her family's way of living. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1681816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

city, Yemen. He studied until secondary education. Due to the miserable condition of his family, Mohammed couldn't complete his studies. He didn't surrender to that miserable condition, but decided to seek any business that would help him earn enough money to look after his family. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, he worked in different commercial stores in Hodeidah city. Over time, Mohammed could accumulate a good amount of money and started his own business selling stationary and accessories such as pens, wall clocks, perfumes, roses, gifts, and other materials in his store in the center city of Hodeidah. He started his business more than five years ago. He started his business with a small amount of capital. In time, his business increased more and more. Mohammed is very thankful for his hard work. \r\n\r\nFor further expanding his business, he applied for a youth loan of 200,000 YER (Yemen rials) from AMB to purchase more stationary and materials for his store for further retailing in his business.\r\n\r\nMohammed looks forward to expanding his business more through opening other branches inside the city. He hopes to open a savings account in AMB in order to purchase a bus and rent it out with a monthly income.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1681831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase more stationery and materials for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"hodeidah","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-09-02T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-02T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohammed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":16685},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16665},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":761300,"name":"Maricel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricel has been selling barbecue in her village to support her husband's income from his employment.

The eldest son, being a spiritual person, goes to Theology College while the other three are in college and are still striving in their ambition to become professionals. All of them are supported by her from the meager income she generates from her petty businesses. From the earlier loans she availed from Kiva, she started a business making local dishwashing and detergent powder to sell. She was making a small profit through that business that hardly sustained her family. So she bought cattle (goat) for rearing from the loan she availed from Kiva in the next cycle, hoping that she would earn more from it. She has been making the maximum use of the loans she avails from Kiva. With the help of Kiva, she has been supporting her children in their education within her capability, she said. At present, the loan she is taking will be used for buying inventory of women\u2019s wear to sell. Women\u2019s wear nowadays sells very quickly and is the best choice of doing business. Every mother desires their children to become someone reliable in their old age. She believes that her hard work will become fruitful one day and she has faith in her children that they will achieve and satisfy her desire in the near future.

He has been farming for 5 years. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy more fertilizer for rice production. The profit from the business will be used to build a store of production.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The profits from the business will be used to buy more land to expand her business.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions.

Lucy's entrepreneurial spirit extends outside agriculture: She is involved in other personal businesses for extra income.\r\n\r\nLucy is very ambitious. She enjoys making more and more returns but lack of adequate capital puts her on a leash. It is for this reason that she is turning to Kiva lenders for a loan. Lucy is seeking KES 21,700 to purchase a cow. With more cows, she will be able to utilize the pasture in her farm and increase milk production. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help Lucy pull herself out of poverty through constantly growing her asset base. The cow you will finance will reproduce and with time Lucy will produce many litres of milk and other dairy products. \r\n\r\nThis improvement in her business will enable her to realize profits that are currently cut due to high cost of inputs. This will impact the rest of her family in a very meaningful way.
