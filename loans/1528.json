Meet Purity, a 32-year-old farmer from Chuka, which is a small, rural town in Central Kenya. \n\nThe mother of two is interested in many farming activities. Currently, she is doing dairy farming, tea farming and horticulture. She has put the last eight years of her life into agriculture. She loves it. Her main sources of income are milk and tea. She makes extra money on the side through venturing in other personal businesses. She is very appreciative of the fact that farming has sustainable returns! This enables her to enjoy profits and expand. \n\nPurity is seeking a loan to purchase an additional dairy cow. This is aligned with her strategy to boost milk production. The demand for milk is very high in Chuka. Purity believes the key to increased milk production is proper health. A dairy cow needs roughage and protein in her diet to be healthy. A healthy cow is more productive, and that means more income for the owner. \n\nThe extra income will enable her to provide a better life for her family and afford her children's education.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":615.63,"image":{"id":1677132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has 45 years of experience in farming.\n\nSarah is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Sarah. Through a group of 15 members called Kaburwo, Sarah has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. \n\nAccording to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitate loans that empower smallholder farmers like Sarah because the institution believe that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural

Meet David, a 42-year-old self-driven man, and a very hardworking and a dedicated farmer. He is based in Chebiemit village, a remote area in Kapsowar, which is a semi-arid area. The living conditions in the Kapsowar area are very tough, being a semi-arid area, and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. David has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. He is happily married and is blessed with 6 children. He is a mixed farmer and has been practicing farming for the past 28 years. He has never looked back and does not regret it. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs, crops and some personal business he engages in to make ends meet. He stated that the most enjoyable part about farming is selling produce in the market, but he faces the challenge of lack of enough rainfall to produce more in the farm. \n\nKapsowar is a semi-arid area which is characterized by very little annual rainfall and scrubby vegetation. David is seeking a loan of KES 130,000 to start irrigation farming in his land. He believes that irrigation is the only way that he can improve his farming. Through application of water to his land, his crops will grow very well. His proximity to a river source is an added advantage to him because he will use pipes to irrigate his farm. David has planned to use drip and sprinkle irrigation technology, but he prefers drip because water application efficiency is high and soil erosion is lessened. Through the loan David will produce more crops and will improve his living conditions. Irrigation will assist David to permanently change his life and achieve his life mission of driving economic development and poverty alleviation in communities living in arid and semi-arid areas. Profits from irrigation farming will be used to comfortably repay the loan, and he promises to fully repay the loan on time.\n\nIn the next two years, David sees himself as a very established farmer who will be practicing agri-business.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1672915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Efua has been farming and doing her oil processing together with a petty trading business for the past 30 years to help her husband take care of the family.\n\nEfua is the leader and representative of the Community Care Group that resides within her community. Efua and her group members are among the people who have gone through Community Exposure Education by the field partner on climate change, indoor and outdoor air pollution, deforestation, soil fertility and the role of gender to address the issues. Her entire group has resolved to use clean cook stoves to improve the health of their families and be responsible towards their community. \n\nEfua is now soliciting for a loan of 170 Ghanaian cedis to purchase a clean-cook stove, Elsa Stove, to reduce indoor air pollution and to prepare her meals in more hygienic conditions to save her children's lives, especially the younger ones who are always with her in the kitchen. Elsa Stove technology was developed under research work of ACP Science and Technology Programme and co-funded by the European Union under the BeBi project.\n\nEfua is pleased with her micro lenders for their kind support. Your loan will  not only help Efua ,but also contribute to achieve the UN Millenium Development Goals that are aimed at reducing child and maternal mortality and disease; and also support in reducing deforestation.\n\n\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1672565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To purchase a clean cook stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Assin Nyankumasi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2014-09-02T17:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-02T17:00:26Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issaka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":141.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.24,"local_amount":72.68,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T10:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595637937},{"amount":55.76,"local_amount":210.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":210.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611730398},{"amount":75,"local_amount":283.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":283.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636153968},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":141.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":141.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649508917},{"amount":35.95,"local_amount":141.65,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":141.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.55,"payment_id":664990579}],"funded_date":"2014-09-02T21:31:05Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":761443,"name":"Parveen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parveen is a 43-year-old married mother of five children.

Every family in their village keeps a small herd of sheep, and if you organize the pasturing of your sheep and cattle well, you can end up with well-fattened livestock. Since Mavlonkul keeps his livestock at home, he needs to use kitchen scraps and other additional sources of food to feed his livestock. For the most part he gives them corn, lucerne and clover, which allow him to fatten the animals well and keep them in good health. He tries to care for them well since he knows that good work brings profit and revenue in the future. \r\n\r\nSince he has a big family, they have a lot of plans for building a house and putting on weddings, and not all members of the family have work or a source of income. Therefore Mavlonkul has turned to Arvand for financial support in the hope of increasing his number of livestock and developing his business, so that in the future he can pass the business on to his children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1677753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

All his life, Sattor has made a living providing shoe repair services for the local population.  This is an activity he learned from his father and grandfather, who themselves learned it from their ancestors.  Sattor has raised his children, married them, and he now believes that it is his duty to be involved in his grand-children's upbringing. His wife helps him with the family business and also works as a seamstress, sewing traditional Tajik dresses. Sattor owns a small shop where he repairs shoes.  In order to improve the family's financial situation and also to help his children raise their own children, Sattor wants to renovate his shop.  However, he doesn't have the money to do so and this is why he has turned to MDO Arvand, requesting support and advice.  By taking a loan from us, he is hoping to be able to improve his shop and therefore increase his income, which will allow him to help his grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1675149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials to renovate his shoe-repair shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-09-02T17:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-02T17:10:13Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sattor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":338.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":345.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":372.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":380.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":385.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":406.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":426.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":426.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":453.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":462.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":477.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":524.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":753840,"name":"Miguel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miguel, born in the Dominican Republic, has been a wholesale representative for different companies for the last 10 years.

She deals in a business selling animals. She buys animals (baby goats and calves) at low prices, raises them and then sells them out in the market at higher prices. She makes enough through her business to contribute to the family income. She also sells milk to generate an extra amount of income. She needs to improve her business to bear her household expenses.

For this reason, her daily activities are affected to a great extent. She said her weaving was not productive anymore because her work was lacking, due to frequent power cuts. After availing herself of the mini solar loan, she can continue her weaving until late evening; she considers this to be very productive. At the same time, the children could study their lessons in a better environment without any interruption by the power cuts after sunset. \r\n\r\nShe expresses her gratitude to WSDS and Kiva for helping her family by lending such a loan that improves their daily lives.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1680987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a mini solar home lighting system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-09-02T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-02T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tombisana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Devala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemolata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60865,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":60865}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-07T14:20:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":761410,"name":"Maa Santoshi Shg (A) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These ten women from the small village of Odisha came together and formed Maa Santoshi Self Help Group in 2013.

Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. The water filter also increases disposable income and available working days due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal or foraging for wood and\/or purchasing bottled water.

Some people in the village are able to buy bottles water.  The water in this area is dirty and unsuitable for drinking without treatment.  The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water.    Yhaw is excited that he and his neighbors were able to purchase a water filter.

During the summer, Morelos is very warm and there has not been a problem,  but now that winter is coming, there will be rain and cold nights. Noe and Maria have been saving for some time to install proper doors, windows and floor to their home. They are now asking for a credit to purchase the necessary materials to be prepared for the harsher weather conditions and offer their family a proper shelter.\nNoe works informally as a janitor in a school and he has no social security and no way to prove an income.

","en":"Burul is 28 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising two children. Burul has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices crop farming. She helped her parents with this business since childhood and now she runs her own agricultural business. Thanks to Burul's hard work, she currently has cattle which she houses in her father-in-law's barns. She also has a plot of land on which she and her husband grow corn and potatoes. Additionally, on a recently purchased plot of land not far from their house, they planted barley and rye. There are also fruit trees on this plot of land. All of Burul's harvested, eco-friendly produce is sold at the local market or to wholesale buyers. Her average monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). This year, Burul did not have enough money to gather the harvest, which is why she turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to organize plowing and pay for fuel and mineral fertilizers. Burul plans to invest the earnings from the loan  in the further development of her business. Specifically, Burul wants to buy a plot of land where she can grow apples."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":1682138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers and fuel as well as pay for plowing for the autumn harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Orozbekovo village, Batken region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-09-02T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-02T18:10:06Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":109.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":25326.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489237},{"amount":452.51,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25326.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.74,"payment_id":624799117},{"amount":466.41,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25326.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.84,"payment_id":664995437},{"amount":414.96,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25326.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":66.29,"payment_id":711411030}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T12:53:11Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:02:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":759819,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria vive con sus padres, est\u00e1 trabajando como recepcionista en una cl\u00ednica privada, el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o termina sus estudios como contador.\nEn adelante le gustar\u00eda ofrecer su profesi\u00f3n y salir adelante y as\u00ed poder ayudar a su familia.

His partner works as a homemaker, and Jervin has no other dependants.\r\n\r\nJervin has worked growing bulk grains such as maize and beans for ten years. Since he was young, his father took him out to the fields where they grew crops, and bit by bit he developed an affinity for this work. He previously worked as a mason's assistant. However, he sometimes had to travel a long distance to work and he had to travel every day from home, which is why he didn't continue in that line of work. The place where he works as a day labourer is only ten minutes from his home and he gets there on foot.\r\n\r\nJervin is requesting this loan from CrediCampo in order to purchase agricultural inputs for his crops.

She is a 30 year-old smallholder farmer based in Nyamarambe division in Lake Victoria region of Kenya. She has been a farmer for only two years. For the short period of time she has been a farmer, she has come to develop a strong liking for milking.  It is the most enjoyable activity, from her perspective. Besides farming, Judith is also an entrepreneur engaged in other personal businesses. \r\nJudith is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to purchase a dairy cow. This additional dairy cow will expand her asset base and increase the volume of milk she sells at the market. The cow will also help cushion shortages in case of diseases or when one cow is about to deliver. \r\nThe extra money she will make from the loan will be dedicated to meeting business-related expenses.

She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Anne believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production.  She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

He is married and his wife is a housewife.  They don't have any children yet and they live with his parents and siblings. \r\n\r\nJose buys and sells pigs which he has been doing for about two years. He learned this business because his mother used to do it, and when he finished high school and was unable to continue to university, he decided to work at raising pigs too. The place where he buys the pigs can vary because sometimes they are sold out near where he lives, so then he must walk farther to negotiate the purchase. This loan will be used by Jose to buy pigs to fatten and then sell them, and will allow him to have more capital to invest so that his business can grow.  This will benefit his family financially. \r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have his own house so his family can have more privacy and comfort. He also dreams of becoming a potential trader with the goal of increasing his earnings and to get ahead with all of his projects."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":504.75,"image":{"id":1680476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy pigs to fatten and then sell them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-09-02T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-02T19:40:05Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":224.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":264.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":311.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":224.22,"local_amount":224.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":224.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832865},{"amount":280.53,"local_amount":280.53,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":280.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711453718}],"funded_date":"2014-10-02T19:27:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":760258,"name":"Sindi Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sindi de 41 a\u00f1os de edad habita junto a su esposo y sus 2 hijos de 1 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad, en vivienda propia desde hace 41 a\u00f1os.

She is married and has six children, three of whom are married, and the other three are outstanding students at the local school. She is 45 years old and over the years she has worked at selling medicines and administering serums to the sick. \r\n\r\nThe work that she dedicates herself to wholeheartedly is the sale of medicines in the community where she lives.  Besides the people who look to buy medicines from her, there are others who seek her out to sew clothes because she is a seamstress.  She is also a farmer in her beautiful community. She is a clear example that if someone wants to do a variety of things in life, it is possible to do so. \r\n\r\nIngrid finds it necessary to apply for a loan to expand her business of medicine sales, which is a service she provides. She hopes to be able to continue to support her children so that they can become professionals in the future, and to continue to serve her community so that everyone might have adequate living

It is interesting to hear her talk about her early days as a stylist after taking various courses. She used to practice on her daughter and give her a range of different hairstyles, and on her son, giving him different haircuts. She is lucky in that she has a job which she really enjoys, provides an income, and always challenges her.\r\n\r\n'VisionFund Mexico provides our group with a great opportunity, and that's why we continue as borrowers', she says.

Urozali has been involved in transporting passengers for 5 years already. He completes 10 trips per day. Urozali is a family man. His wife works as a school teacher. The oldest daughter is 19 years old, and she is a second-year student. The middle daughter is 13 years old and still attends school. And the youngest daughter is 6 years old, and she will start school next year. Urozali's only son is 18 years old. He submitted his application to the Tajikistan Technical University's contract division this summer and successfully passed the exams. The school year will be starting soon, and he has to pay for the annual tuition prior to the school start, otherwise he would not be allowed to start his studies. Urozali, unfortunately, does not have enough savings, and he sees obtaining a loan as the only solution. Urozali, thanks to the loan, would be able to pay for his son's tuition and also buy school supplies. He hopes for the support very much."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1682031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his son's university tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kulob","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.909167 69.781944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-09-02T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-02T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Urozali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":176.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":180.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":186.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":162.4,"local_amount":162.4,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T13:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":162.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561701392},{"amount":166.17,"local_amount":166.17,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":166.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579637998},{"amount":172.23,"local_amount":172.23,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":172.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595214611},{"amount":172.92,"local_amount":172.92,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":172.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610609984},{"amount":176.42,"local_amount":176.42,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":176.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624882034},{"amount":180.39,"local_amount":180.39,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":180.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636348399},{"amount":182.81,"local_amount":182.81,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":182.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649620935},{"amount":186.66,"local_amount":186.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":186.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100918}],"funded_date":"2014-09-18T13:22:03Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T14:16:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":761616,"name":"Nura","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nura is 38 years old.

children in the town of Les Anglais in southern Haiti. Their brown house has no reliable access to electricity, so Ludjy is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. With two of her children in school, she wishes they had better light for studying at night. \r\n\r\nA solar-powered microgrid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Ludjy and her family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower-cost energy source. She is looking forward to being connected because it will allow her to save money. Ludjy is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to cover the upfront cost of connection to the grid, which she will repay through her payments for electricity.\r\n\r\nAn electrical connection dramatically reduces the cost of lighting in towns such as Les Anglais while offering far superior light quality and more generally providing opportunities for people to dramatically improve their quality of

Virginia makes fabric for a living. She is an enterprising, friendly dreamer, and a strong fighter who is responsible and hardworking. Virginia makes cloth in Aygachi which is located southeast of Lago Menor or Wi\u00f1aymarka, in the department of La Paz in the Fourth Section of the Andes with the capital in Puerto P\u00e9rez. \r\n\r\nVirginia has a dark complexion, long black hair, and is of medium height. Her native language is Aymara, and she uses Spanish for business purposes. Since she can remember, when she was about four years old, Virginia has been doing crafts of all kinds. She started knitted with two needles because she saw her mother do it and wanted to try. Then Virginia's grandmother taught her the basics of how to sew, and the work she does now looks nothing like it did when she was little. The colors and materials are changing; her techniques have been perfected. What before seemed ancient, old, and out-of-style, is now what surrounds her life, and she wants it to stay that way. \r\n\r\nVirginia's dream is to have her own storefront. She hopes to purchase raw materials and a cloth cutter to improve her production. Virginia is requesting the loan to purchase the cloth cutter and with better earnings, pay for her daughter's studies.

Meet Rose, a 24-year-old, very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of 10 children. She lives with her husband in the lush hills of Nandi hills, in the rift valley region of Kenya. Rose passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past eight years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nRose has identified a free space in her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk price in the recent past has been going up, so Rose, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learns that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nRose said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Rose hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her 10 school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1682592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-03T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-03T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1820.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2218.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2257.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2347.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2395.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2466.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2587.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2616.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2705.79},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2863.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2943.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.51,"local_amount":4843.8,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4995.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547714},{"amount":27.29,"local_amount":2339.05,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2412.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680735},{"amount":28.56,"local_amount":2448.08,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2524.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625026},{"amount":27.25,"local_amount":2335.44,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2408.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823492},{"amount":28.19,"local_amount":2416.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2491.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261997},{"amount":30.74,"local_amount":2634.85,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2717.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264120},{"amount":31.39,"local_amount":2690.73,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2775.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600276},{"amount":31.2,"local_amount":2674.13,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2757.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458854},{"amount":85.05,"local_amount":7617.7,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7856.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.82,"payment_id":681377134}],"funded_date":"2014-09-04T12:31:30Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lanny Mihardja","image":1677369}},{"id":761840,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn is 44 years old and married.

Her store is located near the main street. Her regular customers are tourists, neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her increase her sales, she is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy rice in sacks\/cavans. This is a major item. Rice is a staple in the Philippines.

Turkadan has received secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she raises livestock and grows farm produce, having started this business 18 years ago by buying livestock for 50,000 KGS. Thanks to Turkadan's hard work, her farm at present includes three cows, 20 sheep, and four horses. She also has a 4.96 ha [12 acres] land plot, where she annually grows potatoes, grains and sainfoin [a plant used for animal forage] for own use as well as for sale. Turdukan sells her environmentally clean produce as well as farm milk locally. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Turdukan has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 80,000 KGS in order to buy livestock for later resale. Turdakan plans to save up for building a new house.

Johnston","image":142987}},{"id":761848,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello Kiva lenders! Meet Patrick, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 55-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of his family, with a wife and three children, he farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nandi hills, in the Rift valley region of Kenya .For the past 21 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk, eggs and tea selling .He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. Patrick passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter and another quality breed of dairy cow. The chaff cutter will assist Patrick in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to feed his cow. Also, it will aid the animal\u2019s digestion and prevent the animals from rejecting any part of their food .Patrick also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-25 litres of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 Kenya shillings per liter and through this loan, he will be making a cool US $11 per day .\r\n\r\nBefore Patrick joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, Patrick now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d .With the loan, Patrick will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Patrick will achieve this .An increase in income will allow Patrick to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Patrick fears that his dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide its reliable market channel, credit facility and services that he requires to grow his dairy enterprise.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":577.99,"image":{"id":1682651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Patience, a 32-year-old farmer from a remote village in Kimindi in the Nandi hills area of Kenya. She resides with her 34-year-old husband with whom she is blessed with two boys and a beautiful daughter. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 12 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs and various food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry, sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that could have been spent in buying fertilizer. Your loan will bring joy to this family because she will be able to support her family and improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1682663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-03T03:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-03T03:40:05Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patience","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4079.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4863.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4941.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5119.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5213.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5590.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5648.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5821.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5957.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6128.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6282.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.08,"local_amount":10666.87,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10886.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542547716},{"amount":59.74,"local_amount":5177.9,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5284.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680738},{"amount":58.73,"local_amount":5090.31,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5195.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625028},{"amount":63.51,"local_amount":5504.35,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5617.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194106},{"amount":126.8,"local_amount":10989.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11216.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624261998},{"amount":134.63,"local_amount":11667.8,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11908.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600278},{"amount":175.73,"local_amount":15903.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":16230.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.78,"payment_id":681377137}],"funded_date":"2014-09-07T06:47:48Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":760557,"name":"Nimfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nimfa is 38 years old and married with two children.\n\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than seven years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\n\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php1,000 in sales every day.\n\nTo improve sales, Linalyn would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 50,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\n\nIn the future, Linalyn hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She aims to expand her business and to provide her the best education, for her family to always be healthy and happy. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \n\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Piso Net is basically a merge of PC rental and Arcade rental services, wherein customers can pay the services by inserting coins in the machine. There is an increased need for services like these in the Philippines, as not everyone has Personal Computers at home. Her main patrons are students, who require her services for school requirements. There are also people who need to rent computers for business purposes like writing a resume or office documentation, as well as people who just love to surf the net and social networks. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in profit every day.\r\n\r\nLetecia believes she will be more successful in her business and dreams of giving her family a better life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1682680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy an additional PC and pay for maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-09-03T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-03T04:20:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Letecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":359.4,"local_amount":15625,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15709.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542492056},{"amount":359.38,"local_amount":15625,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15709.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625243},{"amount":287.48,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":12567.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535386},{"amount":143.74,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6283.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595133746}],"funded_date":"2014-09-03T12:27:02Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:50:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":761872,"name":"Bahtovar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bahtovar was born in 1996.

father and son team both named Jorge. Both being former fishing boat captains, they always had a deep appreciation for fresh, high-quality seafood, which they funneled into starting Pacific North 23, a distributor of top-quality seafood.\r\n\r\nAfter recently expanding to the US, Jorge and Jorge quickly realized that there were many added complexities in running a multinational corporation. This became especially apparent when they tried to seek US financing for their expansion and they realized that they had no US credit history. \r\n\r\nThey eventually found Accion San Diego and Kiva to help them with a microloan to start building credit. Their Kiva loan will be used to purchase more product and pay operating costs, but more than anything else its primary purpose will be to establish Pacific North 23 as a trustworthy business in the United States.\r\n\r\nTheir creation of a transnational supply chain will ensure that they will be able to provide better prices for seafood that exist in the US. With the help of Kiva lenders, Pacific North 23 is an established business that is poised to grow.\r\n\r\nVisit their website: http:\/\/north23.com"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1683065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more product, pay operating costs, and establish a credit history","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Chula Vista","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":249,"posted_date":"2014-09-03T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-03T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":179.21},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":179.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":185.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":187.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":196.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":193.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":198.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":199.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":204.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":206.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":209.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":213.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":219.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":222.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":230.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":232.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":236.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":239.83},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":243.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":247.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.68},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.54},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}}]}
