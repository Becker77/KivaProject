She earns her living by operating a business of buying, weaving and selling nipa (a palm whose foliage is used for thatching). Her husband, Bennymar, who is 30 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 4 and 8 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 6,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $75, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Gilda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before her husband passed away, Miatin had been selling meatball-noodle in a mobile food stall. After his husband passed away, no one could hep her to carry her food stall around. Miatin switched to a stationary food stall near the harbor. She opens her stall from 8AM to 9PM.\r\n\r\nWith initial capital of 300,000 IDR (1USD~9,000 IDR), Miatin can earn a profit of 40,000 IDR daily. She used the profit to pay for her basic needs, for additional working capital and for paying the rent for her food stall of 150,000 IDR per month. With the loan from Dinari, Miatin plans to add more variety to her food stall so she can earn bigger profir and serves more customers.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nSebagai seorang janda, Miatin harus berusaha untuk menghidupi dirinya sendiri karena semua anaknya sudah menikah dan tinggal bersama pasangannya masing \u2013 masing. Sebelum suaminya meninggal, Miatin berjualan bakso dengan cara keliling di lingkungannya. Namun, setelah suaminya meninggal, tidak ada lagi yang bisa mendorong rombong yang dipakainya berjualan. Karena hal itu, Miatin beralih usaha dengan membuka usaha warung nasi di dekat pelabuhan. Miatin membuka usahanya dari pukul 8 pagi sampai pukul 9 malam.\r\n\tDengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 300.000.-, Miatin bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp. 40.000.- per hari. Dengan keuntungan itu Miatin sisihkan untuk keperluan sehari \u2013 hari, menambah modal dan juga untuk membayar sewa tempat usaha sebesar Rp. 150.000.- per bulan. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Miatin berencana untuk menambah jenis dagangannya sehingga ia bisa mendapat keuntungan yang lebih besar dan melayani lebih banyak

She is married with one child. At the moment, her son is in senior high school. She has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and also has been selling grocery products and fruit like bananas for the past twenty years in order to take care of her family. Palm oil is produced from palm fruits. The palm fruit is processed through various stages to obtain the palm oil.  The palm oil produced is used to prepare many local dishes. Her production is on a small scale due to lacking the necessary capital to buy machines for the work of processing.<P>\r\n\r\nIn addition to her palm oil business, she also operates a grocery shop and sells item like sugar, biscuits, evaporated milk, etc., and bananas in the community where she lives. She says this has also slowed down due to current food prices and the economic crunch in the world market. She wants to use the loan to buy more palm nuts to increase her capacity to produce in larger quantities. She plans to purchase rice, sugar, milk, biscuits, and other canned foods, etc. so that she can supply her customers on a regular basis.<P>\r\n\r\nAbena believes this will help expand her business to raise more income to help her husband provide food and finance her dear child's education. Abena belongs to a village bank called \u2018Nyame Nti\u2019 which means For Christ's Sake. She hopes to receive GHS 1000 to make business progress by restocking her inventory.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":269134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Faizullo is 54 years old, married, and lives with his wife and adult son. He works very hard at cultivating wheat, an activity which he has practiced for five years. He enjoys his work for the contact with nature, and also because wheat sells very well in the markets and is valued within his community. Currently Faizullo needs a loan of $675 for his business. With this loan, he will buy seed and fertilizers to improve his farm and get a larger crop. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 39 years old and has three children, all of whom are in school. Her husband is an accountant by trade, but he is currently unemployed, so her small grocery store is their family's only source of income. Her business is currently understocked, however, so this loan will allow her to invest in the purchase of rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, dairy products, chicken, candy and soda. She will then be able to sell more merchandise and earn more in profits so that she can sustain her family and support her husband while he finds another job. She has to support her three children so that they can get a good education. She is thankful to Afodenic for supporting many Nicaraguan families like hers through the current economic\/unemployment crisis as well as through other past and future crises. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":448630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, dairy products, chicken, candy and soda in order to offer a wider variety of merchandise and sell more items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T01:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivania Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":699.97,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":727.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003435},{"amount":22.94,"local_amount":458.88,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":476.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874422},{"amount":26.81,"local_amount":536.29,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":557.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604301},{"amount":26.36,"local_amount":527.1,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":547.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639765},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":577.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821550},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":577.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561557},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":577.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770494},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":577.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204389},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":577.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330113}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T15:20:03Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":166243,"name":"Lizbeth Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lisbeth Rocio H.

T. was born in the district of Boane, Maputo Province, in southern Mozambique. She is 42 years old, and a widow and mother of two children, 23 and 17 years of age. Both children attend school. She only went through the 7th grade, and wasn't able to continue because of her family's difficult financial circumstances. She lives in her own home with her sons, and also supports her mother by sending her money and food.\r\nShe left Boane for the city of Matola after she got married. She's owned her own business for more than 18 years. She works on her own, sometimes with her daughters' help, and sells wooden beds, tables, and bookshelves. She earns 12,000 meticals per month, which she uses to cover household expenses, and is even able to save some in her bank account.\r\nShe's never received loans from other banks. She learned about Hvuluku through her customers who are alsoHvuluku clients. This is her second loan, in the value of 16,000 meticals, which she intends to use to purchase materials (wooden trunks, beds, tables, bookshelves, etc.) to increase her stock. She also used the previous loan of 10,000 meticals for this purpose.\r\nShe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that in the future she'll be eligible for others. She'd like to request other loans to finish off her residence and build a structure from which to run her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":502528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase furniture to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cec\u00edlia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":706.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":738.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":772.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":806.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":843.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":881.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":921.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":963.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1006.6},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1052.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1099.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1149.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1201.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1255.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.4},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1289.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.43,"local_amount":2093.82,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-16T08:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2106.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972154},{"amount":3.86,"local_amount":123.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":124.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732368},{"amount":430.71,"local_amount":13782.58,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":13865.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916187}],"funded_date":"2010-03-10T13:46:24Z","paid_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":187313,"name":"Silvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Silvia es soltera, se dedica a la venta de abarrotes desde hace cinco a\u00f1os, ella vive sola en el barrio Cupesi ya que ahi se encuentra  su tienda donde vende  todos los productos de primera necesidad es una tienda muy surtida ya que tiene lo necesario pero ella necesita ampliar su negocio y con el dinero del credito la Sra.

She is forty-three and married. She has four children: her sons are nineteen and fifteen, her daughters are eighteen and twelve. All her children go to school. Her husband is a construction worker. In addition to doing construction work, her husband also breeds cattle. Gulbaira is a worker at the local hospital. \r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, she spent 7,000 soms on the purchase of cattle for breeding. Since that time, she has significantly increased the size of her herd and makes 8,000 soms each month on cattle breeding. With the profits from cattle breeding, she will be able to pay tuition fees for their children at institutions of higher education. She is planning to save some money to pay for the higher education of her youngest children. To do this, she plans to help her husband increase number of cattle in order to increase her profits from cattle breeding. Therefore, she applies for a loan. She is planning to purchase additional cattle on the loan received. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\n- Nurzhamilia Z. is treasurer of the group. She is forty-eight and a widow. She has two daughters and a son. Her daughters are eleven and five years old. Her elder daughter goes to school and her younger daughter goes to kindergarten \u201cKelechek\u201d. She sells convenience goods at her small shop. Three years ago, her friend suggested she start selling convenience goods because she already had a free place for a shop. So she started selling convenience goods with an initial investment of 60,000 soms. Now, she makes 20 000 soms by selling convenience goods. On the profits from her business, she was able to send her son to an Islamic institution in Pakistan. She is applying for a loan in order to purchase goods and increase her turnover. On the profits from her business, she is planning to expand her business and marry her elder son. \r\n\r\n- Sharshenaly A. is forty one and married. He has three sons. They are fifteen, thirteen and nine years old. All of them go to school. He is hairdresser. He has his own hairdressing salon. In 2000, he finished hairdresser courses and negotiated the rent of a room where he started providing hairdresser services. He has worked for ten years in his own hairdressing salon, which he opened with initial investment of 15,000 soms. Now he makes 8,000 soms monthly.  With the help of the profits from the business, he was able to buy cattle for 10,000 soms. He could increase the size of his cattle herd and he wants to go further. He wants to buy additional cattle for breeding. Therefore he is applying for a loan. With the profits from cattle breeding, he plans to buy a big house for his family, as well as a car. \r\n\r\n- Chynara A. is thirty-three and married. She has four children: her daughters are nine, six and one, and her son is eleven years old. Her elder son and daughter go to school and her youngest two daughters are at home. Her husband is a construction worker in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyzstan). When her husband decided to move to Bishkek in search of employment opportunities, she (upon the suggestion of a friend) decided to start selling convenience goods. She started two years ago with an initial investment of 35,000 soms. Now she makes 15,000 soms monthly. With the profits from her business, she bought furniture and household appliances for her house. She is applying for a loan in order to purchase additional goods and increase her turnover. Through the increase of her turnover, she will be able to increase her profits.

Thekla thanks you for your support!\n\t\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":319858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

With the help of his wife, they are able to handle many of the things they need in life. However, they want to improve their livelihoods and have a sustainable business. So Cirilo decided to take out a loan as a means to achieve their family\u2019s goals. Cirilo said, \u201cWe should be patient in order to have a productive lifestyle.\u201d\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":328638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"St. Tomas Alicia, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T11:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20023.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96883632}],"funded_date":"2009-06-02T09:56:16Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T11:46:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":116823,"name":"Mumindjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0443\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0432  1957 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439.  \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0427\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u0422\u0440\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u043d \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0418 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0434\u044b\u043d\u044c. \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e 2 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438. \u0418 \u043e\u043d \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435. \u0412 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a  \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c, \u043d\u0430  \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442. \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u041a\u0418\u0412\u0410 \u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442  \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438.","en":"Mumindjon T. was born in 1957, he is married and has five children.

Gulnora works hard in order to make the business successful and to generate a stable income for the family. Today Gulnora is planning to purchase the cattle for her household to raise and sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They had to look for a way to generate their own incomes through their businesses, with the objective supporting their households economically.\r\n\r\nDoris is 36 years old, and is the mother of three children aged 15, 13 and 5.  When she was 29 she took the initiative to start preparing meals typical of the sierra region (wheat soup, noodles, spicy wheat, dried potatoes, yuyo); she took them in baskets and pots out to sell in the markets to the vendors and people passing through.  She was there for a fair amount of time and her sales were very good; the traders liked her food as this type of meal was not generally available.  The income from these sales paid for her food expenses, and for her children's education at the time when her husband did not have a job.  Later, she stopped selling because she had to care for her last child, but this did not stop her from beginning to sell groceries from the house.  With money that she saved from her previous work she bought: a sack of rice, 1 1\/2 sacks of sugar, a dozen units of milk and tuna, salt and detergent.  Loans that she received in the past enabled her to set up her business and  generate more income so that she was be able to buy school supplies for her children and enroll them in school.  In addition she improved her home, installing a tank of potable water and putting in an iron window.  This business pays for her family's expenses, given that the salary of her partner is not sufficient to cover them.  Doris wants a better quality of life for her children and to finish construction on her home.  With this loan she will buy sweets, milk, cooking oil, toilet paper, tuna and soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nJuana is 47 years old and is the mother of 2 children.  She and her partner have a business selling fish from a stand.  To do this she gets up very early at 5:30am to buy the merchandise that she needs at the fishing terminal Villa Mar\u00eda in Lima.

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling fruits and vegetables in the local community. Nida has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nida is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Nida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: canteen and farming businesses. Her husband Jose M., who is 62 years old, works as a cook in their canteen to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 18 to 32 years old.\r\n\r\n Juliet joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juliet has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 60,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to pay for more raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future to get into the pig-raising business. \r\n\r\nJuliet M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling junk food, bananas, charcoal and coconut wine in the local community. Rosie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Rosie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from HSPFI. This was used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. Rosie is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional junk food, charcoal and bananas. This will be the seventh loan that Rosie has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Since she was very young she helped her mother attend the small grocery store that was installed in her house. Currently she has her own grocery store and it is well stock with all types of food products, personal hygiene products, and household cleaning products. Her husband helps her to attend the business. Their advantage is that there is no competition because they live in a small community in the outskirts of the city. All of her neighbors visit her store to purchase. With the requested loan she will be able to stock her business and with the profits she obtains she will have an income with which to support her family. Her greatest longing is to be a mother but unfortunately she is unable to become one. So if God permits it she will adopt a little one to give all of her care and love. Her goal is to convert her grocery store into a mini market.

Today she owns and runs two stores specializing in beverages, but it took an impressive amount of dedication and initiative to accomplish what she has. Four years ago, Flor Mar\u00eda had a small stand selling prepared meals in one of the local markets in Ayacucho, Per\u00fa. It was a difficult way to make a living, as the flow of customers was often unreliable due to extremely high rates of competition. In order to improve her economic situation she decided to make a change and open a store specializing in beverages. She supplies all types of sodas and juices, but her big seller is the \u201ccerveza.\u201d Little by little, Flor Mar\u00eda store grew and attracted more customers and she was eventually able to open a second store. \r\n\r\nToday, Flor Mar\u00eda has hired two \u201cse\u00f1oritas\u201d who take care of all the sales and customer service, while Flor Mar\u00eda handles all the administrative duties for the two stores. She builds relationships with her suppliers, watches her product flow carefully to decide what should be stocked, and everything else that goes along with running a small business. It\u2019s hard work and she always seems to have a million things on her to-do list, but she loves her job.\r\n\r\nFlor Mar\u00eda\u2019s next goal is to open a third store in Ayacucho. She is an obviously ambitious woman who is constantly looking for ways to bring her business to the next level. This is why she loves her village bank. It has taught her responsibility, punctuality, and how to save money in the bank where it accumulates interest.

In that time they have learned how to save, how to use their money more effectively, and how to be responsible.  In addition they learned how to avoid domestic violence and how to more effectively prevent sickness.  They like the community bank because it is simple.  At other banks you have to wait a long time and fill out many forms.  <p>\r\nBertha is 30 years old.  She is a single mother and has one six-year-old child.  Her neighbor invited her to join the bank, and she started with just a $50 loan.  At this time she sold vegetables at several regional markets.  Now, with the help of the community bank, she owns a clothing store, and has been able to build a house.  <p>\r\nFrancisca is sixty years old.  She is a widow and has eight adult children.  Francisca never learned to read, and has been working all of her life.  She grows potatoes in the region of Ayacucho, and with a van she was able to purchase with a bank loan, she transports them to the jungle eight hours away.<p>\r\nDora is thirty-three.  She lives with her partner and two children.  She joined the bank twelve years ago when it was just starting out with $2 to her name.  At the time she sold candies on one of the streets of Ayacucho.  Since then she has been able to buy a house and start a new, and more profitable business, selling clothing.<p>\r\nBertha, Francisca, and Dora need loans of 600, 2000, and 600 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will invest in buying clothing, and raising potatoes.<p>\r\nOne of the most important aspects of the community bank is the interest earning savings account each associate has. Bertha, Francisca, and Dora plan to use their savings to put a second floor on their home, buying another field, and adding a roof to their home.  Their dreams are to finish building their home, not have to travel to Lima as frequently, and to see their children happy and healthy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":124548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Bertha, Francisca, and Dora need loans of 600, 2000, and 600 soles (3 soles = $1), which they will invest in buying clothing, and raising potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-02-03T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Hilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-18T21:02:05Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-03-18T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160704},{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-04-18T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185667},{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-05-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213357},{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-06-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":805.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":241549}],"funded_date":"2008-02-04T21:02:05Z","paid_date":"2008-06-18T09:08:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":38992,"name":"Kibibi's Msimamo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kibibi S., age 47, is married and has six children (ages 30, 27, 18, 14, 12 and 6).

This is 47-year-old Rose I. from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has three children between the ages of 18 and 28.  Rose has been running a  genge (grocery store) since 2004. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood and a tin roof where people can buy general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nRose works at the business for 9-12 hours a day, 6 days a week. She currently earns about $400 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $925 USD to purchase rice, maize, and beans. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of her inventory. Rose thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This situation leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She has 12 years experience in the business, selling her products door to door, but she also has a small inventory in a display case at her home where her neighbors can come to buy something for themselves or for a gift because she also has gift-wrapping materials. She is requesting the loan because she wishes to purchase her merchandise at wholesale in order to get her products at cheaper prices, and in this way obtain better earnings herself.<br

group Sabali is composed of five women, all married, of whom three are from monogamous households.\u00a0 The women average 28 years of age and 3 children each and live in the Djaka district (Kirango) of Markala (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\u00a0 They know one another through ties of kinship, marriage, friendship, and community.\u00a0 They are all members of the traditional association \"Traor\u00e9 Ton\", which lends its name to their current association.\u00a0 The group members do commerce exclusively in fish, in all its forms.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the needs of their customers, the women decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program and are now on their fifth solidarity loan after having repaid the four previous loans.\u00a0 This new loan will be used to buy 30 baskets of fresh fish and 50 bars of ice (furnished by transporters coming from Bamako).\u00a0\r\n\r\nSupplies of fresh fish are gotten on the banks of the Niger Rivers.\u00a0 The fish is sorted, and a portion is dried (either on gravel or on straw or on <i>seccos<\/i>).\u00a0 The fish is sold in all forms:\u00a0 the fresh fish is sold locally on the banks of the Niger River, in Kirango, and in Diamarabougou Markala, sometimes door-to-door in the districts.\u00a0 The fresh fish kept on ice is sold in S\u00e9gou (at the Ch\u00e2teau Market) and in Bamako.\u00a0 The dried fish (part of which is reserved until the waters recede and until the off-season when the women earn more money) is sold especially in Dougabougou, Siribala, Niono, Shango, Boussin, and at the weekly fair of S\u00e9gou.\u00a0 The smoked fish is essentially sold in S\u00e9gou. \u00a0 Sales are made generally in cash to customers composed of women and men.\r\n\r\nThe group members plan on realizing an average monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA that will be used to cover sundry family needs and to assist with societal events (baptisms, marriages, funerals).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nTheir ambition is to buy livestock, of which the males will be sold over time in order to build a concession in which to live.\u00a0 This is a way to ensure the children's future.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

The child is currently going to school and also helps out in the business as part of the daily chores.\r\n\r\nEvelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store, sewing business, billiard games and her cafeteria. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 18,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and cafeteria business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing, for her 16th loan, the amount of Php 19,000, which she intends to use on her general store and her other businesses. Evelyn is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

It is located in the village of Jaloxtoc, in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  The group is made up of 5 members who know each other because they are neighbors.  This is their first loan with Fundacion Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe member Monica B. J. is 30, and went to school through the sixth grade.  She has 2 sons, Juan Antonio, 12, and Cristhian Jesus, 8.  Monica sells perfumes and cosmetics through a catalog of the  \u201cJafra\u201d brand.  She needs the loan to buy perfumes, lipsticks, eye shadows and  cosmetics from Jafra.  She started her business 4 years ago when she was given a flyer to come to a talk and she thought this business was a good idea because she would have time to take care of her children, especially the youngest.    He is handicapped.  He can\u2019t speak and he is slow physically so they go for therapy in the city of Cuatla.   Her business is important because it is what supports the family and she puts a lot of energy into it so that sales don\u2019t fall off.  She will use the earnings to pay off the loan and for her son\u2019s therapy and for her since she has to pay  for each session and for the transportation to Cuatla from her home. \u201c To have a handicapped child is to live life differently from other people,\u201d says Monica.\r\n\r\nHer business has competition from others who sell the same products.  Her dream is to set up her own stand so that she doesn\u2019t have to sell from house to house.  In the village of Jaloxtoc the countryside is beautiful.  There are 2 jagueys (trees).  The village feast is the 8th of December honoring Santa Maria and there is a Mass on that day, mariachis, and food for all the people who attend.\r\n\r\nThe other people of the group are:\r\nMaria de Lourdes M. B. who is going to buy  perfumes for woman and cologne for men, lipsticks and eye shadows to supply her business.\r\nSabina H. M. who will buy sugar, straws, bags, flavorings and fruit, etc to make ice cream popsicles.\r\nRufina R. Canutova who will buy shoes to start a business.\r\nChristina C. B. who will buy vegetables and fruit to increase her business.\r\n\r\nMonica says \u201cthanks for trusting in me, for offering me help and I promise not to be dishonest, and to continue getting ahead.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":570977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy perfumes and cometics from Jafra.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JALOXTOC, AYALA;

Tabiah starts traveling around to sell the merchandise from 5 pm to 2 am. In the morning, she prepares the merchandise to be sold while doing her house work. In the beginning, she had $32 as the initial capital and earned only very little profit of $1.6 per night. The  profit also has to be spent for her daily expenses and her son's education.

Awal mula Tabiah hanya bermodalkan Rp. 300.000.- dan hanya mendapat sedikit keuntungan yakni Rp. 15.000.- per malam. Keuntungan itu pun harus disisihkan untuk biaya hidup dan uang sekolah anaknya. Namun setelah mendapat pinjaman dari DINARI, Tabiah sudah mampu mengembangkan usahanya dengan menambah jumlah dagangannya sehingga Tabiah mampu meningkatkan keuntungannya menjadi Rp. 50.000.- semalam. Dengan keuntungan itu, kini Tabiah dapat menyisihkan sedikit dari keuntungannya untuk ditabung."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":66757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To buy merchandises such as cigarettes, snacks, beverages, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-20T13:55:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-04T14:51:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-09T03:42:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64981},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T03:20:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85203},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:15:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100213},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T03:57:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116775},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137342}],"funded_date":"2007-09-20T14:51:32Z","paid_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":22624,"name":"Ignacio","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Sr. Ignacio R., 60, and his wife, Sra.

She earns a living by selling cheeses and trout.  She travels every Thursday to her home town where she acquires all her goods to then sell to vendors and also to individual clients through street or market sales.  Maritza uses large buckets as her principal work tools, and in the buckets she transports her cheeses and fish.  Through this work she ensures the necessary income for her home.  Although her work is tiring due to the long hours that she walks with the heavy buckets, she will continue with this business and with a view towards continuing to grow.  She also demonstrates this drive for progress in her crochet works, which she sends to one of her aunts in the city of Lima to be sold.  This is the second time that Maritza is requesting a loan through MFP; the first time she proved herself to be responsible with her payments and then later withdrew [from the program].  But she returned to work and was admitted again as one of the members of her communal bank, showing her unity and solidarity.  Maritza is requesting this money to increase her inventory with more goods and take advantage of the greater sales at this time of year.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She purchases different kinds of dishes: ceramic dishes, dinner sets and porcelain.\r\n<p>\r\nJamyikan is an experienced businesswoman. She used to trade in various convenience goods as long ago as when she was young. Then she applied for a job and started to work for Government. After the retirement, the pension appeared to be too little to sustain a decent living. So Jamyikan did not hesitate and invested all her early savings, about 70$ in purchasing dishes. She returned to her former occupation of trade.\r\n<p>\r\nNow, she cannot afford a big scale trade. Nevertheless, her engagement brings her a stable income of 65-75$ each month. Jamyikan has applied for this loan to invest it in purchasing different kinds of dinner sets, porcelain, etc. as the New Year is approaching, when many people organize grand arrangements, feasts and buy dishes as New Year\u2019s gifts.\r\n\r\nJamyikan has three partners:\r\n<br>\r\nMairamkul, 53, is a widow and has a son.

The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Seven years ago she started selling her products to her neighbors and little by little her business grew, until today she has an employee helping her with the business.\r\n\r\n<p>Claudia is requesting a loan in the amount of $475 to buy a cooler to keep her products fresh. They are made basically of dairy products, and because of the heat in this region they go bad quickly. The temperature in this place fluctuates between 38 and 42 degrees centigrade. Claudia offers to pay off this loan over a period of 6 to 12 months. She and her family thank you for your support and they await your help in order to improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n<p>(Translated from the Spanish by Naomi Johnson, Kiva volunteer)\r\n\r\n<p>Claudia es casada y tiene dos hijos, una ni\u00f1a de 10 a\u00f1os y un ni\u00f1o de 6 a\u00f1os de edad, ella empez\u00f3 con su trabajo debido a la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica por la que estaba atravesando junto con su esposo y como ella es ama de casa no pod\u00eda encontrar empleo f\u00e1cilmente, por lo que opt\u00f3 por desarrollar su propio negocio haciendo lo que sabe hacer bien que es la reposter\u00eda, as\u00ed hace siete a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s empez\u00f3 vendiendo sus productos entre sus vecinos y poco a poco fue creciendo en su negocio, que a la fecha tiene una persona que la ayuda con el negocio.\r\n<p>\r\nClaudia est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo por la cantidad de US $ 475 para la compra de un enfriador y as\u00ed poder mantener sus productos frescos, los cuales son elaborados b\u00e1sicamente de  l\u00e1cteos y por el calor de la zona se echan a perder, en su localidad el calor fluct\u00faa entre 38 y 42 grados cent\u00edgrados, ofreciendo pagar el pr\u00e9stamo en un lapso de 6 a 12 meses, ella y su familia agradecen tu apoyo y esperan de tu ayuda para poder mejorar su calidad de vida."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":36684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Acquisition of a cooler","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Hermosillo, Sonora","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.066667 -110.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2007-05-30T01:43:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-13T05:29:59Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":475,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T09:16:04Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-03T19:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27250},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-07-30T09:15:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-03T19:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36734},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-08-30T09:15:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-03T19:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47924},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-09-30T09:20:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-03T19:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":60463},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-10-30T10:16:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-03T19:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73769},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T10:23:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-03T19:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88868}],"funded_date":"2007-05-30T05:29:59Z","paid_date":"2007-11-30T10:23:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14447,"name":"Rafia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cMy husband and I work together where I embroider clothes and he sews them in his tailoring shop.

Five years ago he separated from his wife with whom he has 3 grown-up children.  However, as a responsible father he is always looking out for them.  He lives in his own home which is in the native community of Centro Huachirik.  In these years of tension, he feels comfort in his work.  He has been a farmer for 30 years.  His main products are coffee, cacao and a variety of citrus fruits which he constantly tends to, cultivates and irrigates.  Very early in the morning he heads off enthusiastically to his fields where he knows that he can feel relaxed and in peace with nature.  To obtain good fruit, he always tries to provide enough care when he is sowing and also during the fruit's development.  This is clear in every harvest that he has as his products sell very well in the central market in Pichanaki.

Unlike many other residents of the area, Aracely and her family are fortunate to have access to electricity; however they do not have access to potable water. \r\n\r\nFor the last three years, Aracely has earned a living by raising poultry and pigs. She raises her animals on land near her house in pens that are spacious and appropriately built. When the animals are full-grown, she sells them to merchants and the general public in the local market. Aracely generates additional income by selling clothes to members of her community and surrounding towns. \r\n\r\nAracely plans to buy balanced feed to fatten her livestock. She hopes that her animals will gain weight in less time so she can sell them for a higher price in the market. To achieve her goals, she has requested from Edpyme Alternativa a loan of 500 nuevos soles. Aracely is a hard-working woman.

He is married to Sophina Nato and he is the father of eight children, with only one child below fifteen years of age. He lives in a five-bedroom apartment with his family. He lives in Tudig, a village in Momo division in the North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nPoverty has been his major setback in life. Due to encouragement from a friend who is a GHAPE member, he joined GHAPE in 2008. The first loan he received was used to buy pigs. He used the profit from that project to sponsor two of his children in the university and one in technical high school. He needs a loan this time which he intends to use to buy pigs, goats, and feed for his animal farm. He is convinced this business will succeed because he is very well versed in the business and knows that they reproduce very fast. He intends to use his proceeds to expand his farm, buy medicine for his children, and to continue to sponsor them in school.\r\n\r\nLucas confesses that ever since he joined GHAPE, his life has never been the same again. The poverty he used to suffer is gradually going away and his children\u2019s school fees have never been a problem again.\r\n\r\nHe prefers a loan from GHAPE because the time for reimbursement is longer and the interest rate is relatively lower.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.
