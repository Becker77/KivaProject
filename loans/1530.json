and that's that food cooked over a wood fire tastes the best. This is Samuel's line of work, cooking typical dishes that he prepares outdoors over an open flame (see photo).\r\n\r\nSamuel learned this profession six years ago while he was working for someone else. When he saw that he had all the necessary qualities to run a business himself he set off on his own, and for four years he has been working and thinking big. This is why he is now asking for a loan, so that he can give a colleague of his the opportunity to start preparing foods with him, using Samuel's recipe.\r\n\r\nSamuel is asking for this loan in order to give his currently out-of-work colleague a job.

Desde hace ya 7 a\u00f1os, do\u00f1a Blandina estableci\u00f3una peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes en su casa. Con las ganancias obtenidas y la aportaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de su esposo quien se dedica a trabajar en el campo y a pescar en la laguna para vender mojarra, sustentan los gastos de la familia. Do\u00f1a Blandina comenta que al a\u00f1o, cuando la laguna \"crece\" (aumenta el nivel del agua) debe desalojar su casa y levantar todas sus pertenencias para no perderlas por lo que igual traslada la tienda a casa de sus suegros donde viven dos meses al a\u00f1o, \u201cya nos acostumbramos a cambiarnos cuando la laguna crece\u201d coment\u00f3.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Blandina invertir\u00e1 su pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de: arroz, frijoles, aceite, az\u00facar, galletas, aceite, sopa, sazonadores, at\u00fan, chiles en lata, papel higi\u00e9nico, detergente, shampoo.

Blandina is 45 years old and married to Sr. Camerino.  They have four children, three daughters and one son.  Seven years ago, Do\u00f1a Blandina established a small grocery store in her home.  With the money she earns, she is able to assist her husband financially.  He works in the fields and also fishes at the lake so that he can sell \u201cmojarra\u201d (a fish similar to tilapia).  They both are able to maintain their family\u2019s expenses.  Do\u00f1a Blandina says that when the water level of the lake rises, she must vacate her house.  To prevent from losing her belongings, she has moved everything to her in-laws\u2019 house where she and her family live two months out of the year.  She says, \u201cWe are accustomed to moving whenever the lake rises.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Sra. Blandina will invest her loan in the purchase of rice, beans, oil, sugar, cookies, oil, soup, seasonings, tuna, canned chili peppers, toilet paper, detergent, and shampoo.  This will enable her to restock her store so that she can satisfy the needs of her customers.  <br \/><br \/>The other members and their businesses are as follows:<br \/>\u2022 Lida sells cosmetics.<br \/>\u2022 Angela sells groceries.<br \/>\u2022 Juana sells food.<br \/>\u2022 Clara sells fish.  <br \/>\u2022 Mauricia sells chicken.  <br \/><br \/>All of them belong to the group named \u201cLas Gaviotas\u201d (The Seagulls), which is located in a community known for producing sugar cane and rubber.

He is a talented and respected responsible man and knows how he runs his life well. He has a high determination inside himself to improve the living standards of his family and to prepare his house with all the family's needs. From this perspective, he decided to start his own business besides his work in the public sector. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Khaled accumulated a good amount of money from his salary and purchased a minibus to work as a driver in order to earn money. Over time, that bus became very old and now does not work well as well as it needs to, requiring weekly repair and maintenance. Khaled could not afford this because the repair and maintenance cost him a lot of money. For this reason, Khaled decided to purchase a taxi to work as a driver, transporting people from one place to another inside the capital city of Sana'a, in order to earn money and be able to provide his family with a better future. Khaled believes that this taxi will be very profitable for him than his old minibus, and he will earn a lot of money. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Khaled's salary is not enough to purchase a taxi. As a result, he has applied for loan of 2,000,000 YER from AMB, in order to purchase a taxi to use instead of his old minibus, adding another income source for his family. \r\n\r\nKhaled looks forward to providing his family with a better future.

She is always on the lookout to make sure the chickens aren't short of food so they develop healthily. Her husband helps her when it is time to sell them. They butcher and prepare the chickens before selling them by the pound.\r\n\r\nThe loan money will be used to buy 500 chicks to raise as well as special feed for them.\r\n\r\nMirna's hopes for the future are to have a bigger pen for the chickens and to increase her income for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1681375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":".buy 500 chicks to raise as well as special feed for them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-09-05T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-05T00:10:08Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":165.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":183.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.61,"local_amount":154.61,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":154.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420979},{"amount":171.57,"local_amount":171.57,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":171.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769205},{"amount":172.41,"local_amount":172.41,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":172.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802374},{"amount":201.41,"local_amount":201.41,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":201.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711453723}],"funded_date":"2014-09-22T15:13:50Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:50:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":762867,"name":"Sina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sina (in the photo), age 23, is single and lives with his parents on an island of Mekong River.

He and his wife Ruth are blessed with one child. Albanu has been running a battery shop for five years now, selling battery acid and other chemicals. He earns an income of 15,000 Kenya Shillings (KES) by the end of every month.

She would like to replace the chairs which are old and ugly and buy tables, tablecloths and new implements for cooking which she needs including ladles and pots.

However, the income is not enough to fulfill his family\u2019s basic needs. This has forced him to venture into other numerous side businesses.<br \/><br \/>There is no denying that David loves what he is doing. He names all the animals on his farm.

He is planning to use these farm inputs, which include cereals, to prepare for the coming season.

You can start from any level and there are so many forms of farming you can do\u201d, says James. He is a father of 3 and has been practicing mixed farming in Kahuhia, a remote village in the Thika area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nFor the past four years he has been selling milk, eggs, tea and has some personal business he has been doing to supplement the meager income he earns. \r\n\r\nIf there is one thing James is good at, it is raising farm animals! Meni, his dairy cow, is very well taken care of. She gets the best feed and medical care James can provide. \r\n\r\nHowever, his biggest challenge is raising capital. James has a sound investment plan that will push him to the next level. James is seeking a loan through Kiva to purchase a water tank. Constant availability of water at his homestead will make work very easy for him.

She weaves different designs and patterns of traditional bags for selling in the market. She supplies the end products to the market and earns a little profit from those supplies. Those bags are popularly used by school- and college-going youngsters. \r\n\r\nPresently, she will be expanding her production by weaving more bags of different models, and therefore she is in need of capital to buy yarn with different textures and other needed materials. Fortunately, she availed a loan from WSDS and could buy the desired yarn and achieve her desire. \r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to Kiva for helping her family to achieve her dream of expanding her weaving production.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

In 1993 she started working in animal husbandry and agriculture, a business she began with 20,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work she now has two cows, two horses and 16 sheep, and sells up to 12 litres of milk every day. She has a little poultry farm where she raises chickens and sells them; she currently has 158 chickens. On a 4.2 hectare piece of land she grows potatoes, which she sells at the local market, and hay, which she keeps to feed her livestock in the winter. In addition, she grows organic and flavourful pears, apples and currants, which she sells at the local market or to wholesale buyers.\r\n\r\nDzhiparkul has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy building supplies so she can build a barn for her livestock. She has already laid the foundation for the future building and bought bricks, but she doesn't have enough for slate and beams. The loan will help her to build a barn without having to sell any livestock.

Meet Mary, an ever-smiling young farmer from Kapsowar County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture.\r\n\r\nShe is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past 5 years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nMary passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nMary is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. Through the loan she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1684533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-05T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-05T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2574.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3099.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3227.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3287.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3385.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3564},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3592.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3718.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3810.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3935.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4041.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4161.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.4,"local_amount":6648.14,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6942.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680749},{"amount":40.54,"local_amount":3438.17,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3590.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625038},{"amount":41.64,"local_amount":3530.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194117},{"amount":84.32,"local_amount":7150.04,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7466.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262007},{"amount":89.85,"local_amount":7618.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7955.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600288},{"amount":91.86,"local_amount":8125.23,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8484.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.96,"payment_id":681377147},{"amount":64.18,"local_amount":5888.84,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6149.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.25,"payment_id":711505197}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T17:33:26Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":763043,"name":"Alina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alina appreciates the previous loan.\r\n\r\nAlina operates a stall selling fruits and vegetables.

She quit after facing problems with being at the same workplace as her husband. She did not work for one and a half years. She got really bored at home. She wanted to be busy and do something. She used to dream of having her own boutique. She remembered her dream and said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d and started to work on that dream. First she rented a store and then borrowed money from a friend to buy materials. This way she opened her shop with limited resources, and has been working for one year. She constantly is trying to improve and do better for the business. With the loan she is planning to buy new clothes for the boutique.\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\nAysel han\u0131m evli \u00fc\u00e7 \u00e7ocuk annesi.Kad\u0131n k\u0131yafetleri sat\u0131\u015f\u0131 yap\u0131yor.Aysel han\u0131m evlendikden sonra \u00e7al\u0131\u015fm\u0131yor ve \u00e7ocuklar\u0131n\u0131 b\u00fcy\u00fct\u00fcyor.

She is based in Kapsowar. It is a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married and, together with her husband, has four lovely children. Her primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Tecla is a tough woman with tough skin and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling.\r\n\r\nThe Kapsowar area has conditions that favor dairy farming and Tecla has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow but the lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow. The dairy cow she intends to buy is not just an ordinary cow. It\u2019s a breed that produces between 10-20 liters of milk a day. With this cow, she will produce more milk which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Kapsowar area is high but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Tecla is going to reap more and comfortably meet the demand.\r\n\r\nHer increased income will allow Tecla to provide a secure future for her school-going children by paying their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success. Her vision is to keep even more dairy cows so that she will be able to build a biogas digester, which would help her to save more energy.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1684513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Almas is in her 5th loan cycle and has shown good repayment behavior. She has now requested a loan of 40,000 PKR to purchase spools of threads, a measuring tape, embroidery scissors, frames and tracing paper.

Every year, her husband travels to Russia for work as it is difficult to find good paying jobs in their District. Dilbar is a teacher. She works in a local school. She is 40 years old. Currently, one of her sons is a student. His name is Sharifjon and he is 18 years old. He studies at the Financial-Economic Institute of Tajikistan in the Department of Finances and Loans in Business. This year, Sharifjon has started his second year of studies, however his family have not yet paid for his tuition. Dilbar does not currently have any savings, which is why the only option she sees is getting a loan. She is in need of 600 USD, which is the amount she is requesting for her loan. Dilbar really hopes that you will support her in this difficult situation, as her son studies diligently and really wants to receive a higher education in
