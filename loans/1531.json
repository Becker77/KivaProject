world! Meet Lydia, a mother of four from Kapsowar, a remote village in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past two years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business, to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nLydia is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her animals. She is so close with her animals that she has nicknamed one of them \u201cKipara,\u201d meaning no feathers on the head.\r\n\r\nLydia wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan of KES 50,000, which she will use to buy additional poultry. With your loan, Lydia will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money. Lydia is very concerned about her children\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay their school fees. Lydia dreams of a secure future for her children. Lydia awaits your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1684613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-05T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-05T16:40:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3510.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3659.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3724.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3835.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4050.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4069.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4217.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4316.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4463.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4578.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4714.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4859.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.37,"local_amount":8640.79,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8799.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625040},{"amount":46.31,"local_amount":4027.06,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4100.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194119},{"amount":94.53,"local_amount":8219.77,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8370.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262009},{"amount":52.96,"local_amount":4604.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4689.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600290},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":4069.72,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4144.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458861},{"amount":102.67,"local_amount":9312.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9483.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.43,"payment_id":681377149},{"amount":118.25,"local_amount":11125.04,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":11328.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.68,"payment_id":711505199}],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T09:41:15Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kim Schultz","image":null}},{"id":763099,"name":"Vestine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vestine 31 years old.

Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1684619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy more fertilizers for rice production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2014-09-05T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-05T16:40:05Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1204752,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1204752}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1775,"local_amount":1204752,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1215875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":639743968}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T22:24:33Z","paid_date":"2015-05-01T11:05:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":763054,"name":"Truth Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These members are part of the group called Truth and they are beginning their ninth loan cycle with ID-Ghana.

most people hitting the 60-year-mark means a life of absolute reliance on their children or immediate family members for their livelihood. However, for Jane, somehow life begins at 60. This mother of four has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years on her small parcel of land in the Kapsowar area of Kenya and has been earning a decent income. She also does some personal business to supplement her meager income. Of all the activities she is involved in, Jane enjoys poultry keeping the most. To her, poultry keeping went from being a way of life on an African homestead, to being a hobby, to being a business. \r\n\r\nJane is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. With this loan, she seeks to grow her business. However, it has been a rough ride for her to find a financier who would front money to a mere smallholder farmer without substantial security or a bank statement showing a regular source of income. Today, Jane is a member of Cheptulon Self-Help Group. Through the group, she can access loans from Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance institution that was started to take care of small holder's financial needs. Since joining, the group has been trained to embrace saving money and group management to ensure cohesion and development.\r\n\r\nYour loan will help Jane to earn more income that will enable her to pay for her children's education for a brighter future. The money will also enable her to take care of the basic needs of her family. When asked how she envisions life after successfully repaying the loan, Jane replied that her family's living standards will improve.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1684599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-05T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-05T16:40:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1214.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1462.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1522.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1550.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1597.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1681.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1694.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1754.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1797.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1856.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1963.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.29,"local_amount":3222.99,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3567.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680750},{"amount":20.61,"local_amount":1648.64,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1824.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625039},{"amount":21.34,"local_amount":1707.54,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1890.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194118},{"amount":42.9,"local_amount":3431.97,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3798.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262008},{"amount":45.69,"local_amount":3654.87,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4045.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600289},{"amount":46.76,"local_amount":3902.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4319.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.02,"payment_id":681377148},{"amount":28.09,"local_amount":2431.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2691.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.3,"payment_id":711505198}],"funded_date":"2014-09-05T22:25:43Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":763074,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther lives in Hoima, Uganda.

entirely. Nancy is a smallholder mixed-farmer based in Kapsowar, a remote village in Kenya. She is a mother of three lovely children and has been practicing mixed farming for the last two years.\r\n\r\nTo earn a decent living, she sells eggs, milk, greens and engages in numerous small personal businesses, including transportation. Only recently, she started seeing how she could make more money through poultry farming. In the past, she saw raising hens as just a hobby. She wants to sell eggs, but assumes that the quantity she produces will not make economic sense. She needs to purchase more poultry. However, her biggest challenge today is limited funds to expand her business.\r\n\r\nNancy is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 from Kiva lenders, via Juhudi Kilimo, to purchase poultry. \r\n\r\nFuture proceeds from the commercialization of her poultry farm are already committed to pay for her children's education. In the long run, she is confident that her efforts will translate into a better quality of life for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1684615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-05T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-05T16:50:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1214.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1462.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1522.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1550.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1597.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1681.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1694.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1754.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1797.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1856.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1963.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.29,"local_amount":3222.99,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3567.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680751},{"amount":20.61,"local_amount":1648.64,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1824.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625041},{"amount":21.34,"local_amount":1707.54,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1890.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194120},{"amount":42.9,"local_amount":3431.97,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3798.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262010},{"amount":45.69,"local_amount":3654.87,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4045.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600291},{"amount":46.76,"local_amount":3902.64,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4319.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.02,"payment_id":681377150},{"amount":28.09,"local_amount":2431.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2691.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.3,"payment_id":711505200}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T07:37:55Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kim Schultz","image":null}},{"id":763065,"name":"Mariamu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariamu, aged 37 years, is a married woman with four children, all of whom attend school.

He will use the profits from his business to buy rice seeds.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

","en":"Nazira is an attentive mother of three children. Her older sons work abroad in the Russian Federation. Her daughter, Sadokat, graduated from secondary school this year and enrolled in university. Sadokat is a smart girl and does well in school. She dreams of becoming a great specialist in the future. Nazira needs to pay for her daughter's tuition but her salary does not allow her to do so. She has worked for more than 15 years in a government agency.

Her dream is for  the children go to school, to have decent work, and to become responsible people and good examples in life for other people.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1681501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfume, beauty products, and items like watches, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Santa Fe de Antioquia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-09-05T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-05T19:20:04Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21388},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21986},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22600},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23231},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23880},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":24547},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25232},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25937},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26662},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27406},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28172},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28959}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.52,"local_amount":21455,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T14:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":24184.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542542808},{"amount":12.56,"local_amount":21851,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":24630.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.19,"payment_id":561675729},{"amount":11.63,"local_amount":22538,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":25405.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.52,"payment_id":579599314},{"amount":11.94,"local_amount":23361,"processed_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":26332.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.68,"payment_id":595189543},{"amount":12.17,"local_amount":23880,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":26917.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.76,"payment_id":611814822},{"amount":11.31,"local_amount":24318,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":27411.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.88,"payment_id":624864532},{"amount":12.74,"local_amount":25745,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":29020.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.28,"payment_id":636621935},{"amount":13.74,"local_amount":26488,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":29857.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.71,"payment_id":649596087},{"amount":54.25,"local_amount":110364,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:52:32Z","rounded_local_amount":124403.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.12,"payment_id":665455334}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T00:29:44Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T12:52:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":761050,"name":"Rosa Emilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"9 a\u00f1os se tard\u00f3 la se\u00f1ora Rosa para seguir los consejos de sus hermanas mayores quienes le ense\u00f1aron el oficio de la confecci\u00f3n y ahora que abri\u00f3 los ojos est\u00e1 dispuesta a montar su propio taller que traer\u00e1 grandes beneficios como lo son generar m\u00ednimo  dos empleos, que este cerca de su casa y mejorar su calidad de vida.

Her husband, being a businessman encouraged her to begin a business. Thus, in 2012 she began a business of selling charcoal,because charcoal is a major source of cooking fuel for the low income urban dwellers and therefore was assured of customers. Much as the capital was little she believes she could get some profits to supplement the earnings of her husband so as to look after their family. Through getting loans from UGAFODE her business has improved and she is doing well. Agnes approached UGAFODE for a second loan through the group so as to buy more stock of charcoal for sell.

After school, Eric engaged in small business projects, besides his pastoral duties to his community, to enable him to supplement his income and support his family of two children and a wife who works as a community volunteer in Gabba, central Kampala, where they currently live. \n\nEric was introduced to the business of selling clean energy cook stoves by sales agents from Impact Carbon, a renewable energy support organization and since then, he has never looked back. Recently he was introduced to UpEnergy, through which he has been able to sell cook stoves, raise part of the school fees for his children and offer more support to his family members.\n\nEric is looking to use the Kiva loan to expand his Renewable Energy Business. The loan will enable Eric to ensure availability of stock, which he currently can\u2019t afford, so that he can extend and grow his business. With a successful running business Eric will be able to provide payment in installments to end-users, who cannot afford to pay the products at once. Thus demand will increase and Eric needs to have more energy-efficient products available. \n\nUpEnergy enables Eric to access financial support services like the Kiva loan and offers marketing support. UpEnergy is helping to eradicate poverty by enabling the youth to be part of a business that helps improve lives. \n\nThe biggest benefit from using energy-efficient stoves for Eric is that it helps families to save money and time. The members of the community are able to save more money and time by using energy-efficient cook stoves, while people\u2019s health will improve, too.\n\nEric hopes to build his own house and have a self-sustaining business that can enable him to save for his family's future.

She decided to ask the court for a divorce. Now, she is remarried and has three more children. It\u2019s hard for me to ask my stepfather to fund my studies since life is hard for him. His income as a laborer is far from enough to meet all of our daily needs. I planned to work to help my parents, but my education level is not good enough to do so. It\u2019s hard for a junior high school graduate to get a good job. That\u2019s why I\u2019m glad I can join Kiva\u2019s program: I hope I can get support to continue my studies.

She hopes that in the future she will be able to become a nurse. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1677143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Youth"],"use":"to buy more stock of rice, sugar, soap, and curry powder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kiyinda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nashim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":53480},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":54119},{"due_date":"2014-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":54764},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55417},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":56080},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56748},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":57425},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58111},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":58804},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59505},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60216},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":60935},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":61661},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":62397},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63143},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":63896},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":64659},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":65429},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":66211},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":67000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.29},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.76,"local_amount":320233,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":329573.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542481119},{"amount":217.18,"local_amount":548668,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":564670.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561614722},{"amount":104.22,"local_amount":263299,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":270978.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579524672},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":67800,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":69777.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":595124702}],"funded_date":"2014-09-06T00:40:40Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:44:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brian Arens"}},{"id":763339,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia is 52 years old and married with three children.

She is selling grocery items to the people in her village. She opens up her store as early as 6:00 a.m. in the morning until 6:00 p.m. in the afternoon. She would like to add more goods to sell.

She is 34 years old and currently resides with her husband, Johnrey, in Manila, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than three years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages, piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Jacqueline would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 10,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Jacqueline hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy.

He studied until the elementary education. Unfortunately, he didn't complete his a studies. Now, he is an employee in a private sector with a small salary and lives with his family in a humble house in Taiz city, Yemen. The salary that he receives from his job is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family. He is a very vigorous and ambitious young man and works hard to improve the living condition of his family. The house where Mahran and his family live lacks many home appliances, and most of them are very old and need to be changed. Mahran and his family feel ashamed from this condition, especially if any guests come to visit the house. Mahran wants to make the necessary improvements for his house. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the enough money to do that. For this reason, Mahran applied for a Youth loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase furniture for his house.

Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more than five years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner have to work hard and be determined to have a better income and to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Myrna would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 10,000 PHP, she could purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely expresses her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Myrna dreams that her business will continue to flourish. She hopes that her family will always have something to eat, and she also desires to give her children a good quality education.

Meet Rose a young farmer from Cheptonge a remote village in Kapsowar Kenya who has defied the common thinking about most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. Rose is happily married and together with her husband they are blessed with 2 boys and 2 girls. Her primary source of income is milk and also she plants tomatoes on her farm and has named her tomato farm \u201cever blazing farm\u201d. She also engages in personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. Rose practices agriculture with a difference employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the many agricultural training he has been attending to broaden her skills.\r\n\r\nAlthough she earns handsome profits from farming she faces one big challenge and that is high prices in fertilizers, seedlings and inputs and this is a result of the monopoly that is enjoyed by the only agro vet shop in her area. She is requesting a loan to start an agro vet shop. Cheptonge area has only one agro dealer who is catering for thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on him for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a kill from farmers by charging them extra amounts since he is the only agro dealer and enjoys monopoly. Rose wants to change this and seize the business opportunity and through your loan she will start an agro vet shop and tap into the potential agricultural market. Rose will also help the smallholder farmers in his area who for a long time have been having a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. Through your loan Rose will change from the peasant farmer she is right now to a certified agro dealer who will be depended on by nearly 9000 smallholder farmers in her area both for input, knowledge and information about improved inputs. Through increased income from the loan she will improve her living conditions and her future plans are to purchase a truck which will be used to engage farmers in output marketing activities.\r\n\r\nRose believes that there is no doubt that youths like her can find rewarding employment in farming. She patiently waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1685062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Ergeshbai works as a freight handler, but in addition to his job, he is also involved in agriculture and he currently owns two cows.  He has more than ten years of experience in this type of work.  \r\n\r\nErgeshbai is a respected man; he is friendly, punctual, a good communicator, very responsible and he has an enterprising spirit.  Recently his family experienced a very unfortunate event: their house was completely destroyed in a fire and they literally have no place to live anymore.  Ergeshbai has already sold 20 sheep and 9 cows to rebuild his house, but he is still in dire need of money, especially since he has another loan which he needs to repay.  For all these reasons, he has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a preferential loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to refinance his previous loan and rebuild his house.  This loan will help him to rebuild a new home, take care of his family and keep his livestock. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1685298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to rebuild his house, destroyed in a fire, and to refinance a previous loan.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Belovodskoe village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T03:40:01Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":132.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ergeshbai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":674.07,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":37726.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.43,"payment_id":624799122},{"amount":618.15,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":37726.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":94.35,"payment_id":711411037}],"funded_date":"2014-10-01T15:22:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":763374,"name":"Sabita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"23-year-old Sabita is a woman of courage and strength.

She is 46 years old and she is happily married to Rizaldy, who is a security guard. God has blessed them with five loving children and three of them are already studying. Life indeed is hard. But by the grace of God, they were able to raise their children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nMarina owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, an egg, and other things. She gets her product from a wholesaler at a lower price, then she sells it per piece for a higher price to have profit. She also offers prepaid load services and she buys and sells processed food products for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby and the people in the community. She earns Php 1000 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a Php 35,000.00 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nMarina desires to have her own burger stand and that her variety store will soon become a grocery store. She also hopes to have a better life someday. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1685125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":11666.65,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":12013.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542492077},{"amount":275,"local_amount":11666.65,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":12013.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625267},{"amount":220,"local_amount":9333.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":9610.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535410},{"amount":55,"local_amount":2333.38,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2402.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595133764}],"funded_date":"2014-09-06T21:00:45Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:50:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":763459,"name":"Jackielyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackielyn is 32 years old and married with two children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

The above picture presents Alice, a mother of two who has been practicing agriculture for the last 17 years. \r\n\r\nBecause of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect among other farmers and she is viewed as a mentor in her village. She lives together with her children in the Kerugoya area of Kenya, which is known for coffee plantations for export. \r\n\r\nHer primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Generating an income through selling harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. Availability of labour is a major challenge for Alice. She also keeps a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nBefore joining Juhudi, Alice could not access loans from banks since they considered her a high risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the group Maendeleo Kasarani. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learnt about loan management and agribusiness.

She buys accessory items from wholesalers and sells them per piece with a profit. Products are items like beaded jewelry such as necklaces,  bracelets, earrings and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are students and mall patrons.  She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of accessory products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMaribeth dreams that her children will finish their studies and she also hopes for a successful and prosperous life in the future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Meet Priscilah, a very hardworking, energetic mother of 2 lovely children. Priscilah resides in the Kerugoya area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming activities. \r\n\r\nPriscilah has been doing mixed farming for the past 19 years and through those years she has gathered so much experience with the techniques of farming. Through the income from farming she has been able to take care of her family and also provide the basic needs for her grandchildren. Priscilah is a very enterprising woman, and although she never got formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her family of a decent meal. \r\n\r\nThe Kerugoya area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. Being a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Priscilah feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. Priscilah is very disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits she will be able to improve her living conditions and also secure the future of her grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1685217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscilah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4622.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4697.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4837.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5128.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5134.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5326.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5446.07},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5636.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5776.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5948.23},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6137.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6308.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.61,"local_amount":10452.94,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10698.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194127},{"amount":113.35,"local_amount":9823.69,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10054.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262016},{"amount":120.82,"local_amount":10470.94,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10716.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600297},{"amount":125.21,"local_amount":11300.88,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":11566,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.18,"payment_id":681377156},{"amount":245.21,"local_amount":22951.55,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":23490.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.62,"payment_id":711505205}],"funded_date":"2014-09-10T01:37:27Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zoe Benston","image":null}},{"id":763540,"name":"Jostina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jostina is a 43 year-old married female.

","en":"Dilmurod grew up in a big rural family as one of eight children. His father was disabled and had a small shop. The family depended on his mother, who worked several jobs to feed her children: as a cleaner, as a caretaker and as a hired labourer. Dilmurod didn't have the opportunity to get a university education. For eight years, he worked as a migrant labourer in Russia. Now he is living at home again and working in home construction. He has two children - a 20-year-old son who is married, and an 18-year-old daughter who just graduated from high school and has entered university to become a teacher. Dilmurod is requesting a loan of $450 USD to pay her tuition. He awaits your kindness and hopes for your charity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1685714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher
