They work everyday since as a family they seek to earn income to improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nSantos needs the loan to buy a plot of land, since she has the opportunity to do so and to increase the size of the property she inherited.

She is single with two children and never had access to a formal education. In order to provide for her children, she began a small tortilla business. Magdalena joined the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cSanta Lucia\u201d to help finance her business with a microloan.\r\n\r\nWith a new loan, Magdalena wants to continue with her plan to expand her business. She wants to buy and install a grinder for her cornmeal. The new grinder is very important to her business since it will mean that she does not have to use an outside milling service which takes time and money away from her business. Magdalena is certain that with the new loan investment her business will be more productive.\r\n\r\nMagdalena is grateful for the various subjects like health and education that the Trust Bank officer provides. Friendship Bridge believes that the combination of small loans and education, called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is a combination that yields very positive results. Magdalena and the women in the \u201cSanta Lucia\u201d Trust Bank meet each month with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who shares timely and useful information with the women on a variety of subjects like health, hygiene and nutrition as well as self-esteem and violence against women. The women learn about effective business management practices as well, and gain essential knowledge about business planning, budgeting, accounting, customer service, marketing and pricing.\r\n\r\nMagdalena and the eight other women of the \u201cSanta Lucia\u201d Trust Bank feel that with the necessary captial to finance their business, they can become independent and better their lives as well as the lives of their children.

On market days in this town, you can buy and sell everything from small hair accessories, to large quantities of clothing, to animals \u2013 goats, pigs, beasts of burden, chickens, turkeys, etc. It is in this marketplace that the women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cFlorecer\u201d (Flourish) sell their products.

Julia buys and sells clothing throughout the market nearest her. She sells four days a week. Julia is asking for a new loan in order to buy more merchandise since the Guatemalan Independence Day festivities are approaching which usually means more sales. She plans to buy shorts, shirts, scarves, flags, pants, skirts and blouses to cover all market needs. This will allow her to generate more income. \r\n\r\nThis is Julia\u2019s third loan cycle which means that she and her group have shown a great deal of responsibility with their monthly payments. For this reason they are confident in applying for a new loan cycle. They have learned a great deal from the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of Friendship Bridge which has taught them good business management, budgeting, marketing and customer service, proving that the combination of small loans and education provides positive results.

Because they successfully concluded their first loan cycle, the eight women of \u201cEl Roble\u201d are confident they can ask for new working capital.\r\n\r\nThe group is located in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. This is the story of Teresa, an entrepreneurial woman with high aspirations. Teresa is involved with the fabrication of pi\u00f1atas and other festival items. After eight years in business, she was able to expand and sell her merchandise to wholesalers. Her business is doing so well that she has hired two young women to help her, which enables them to continue with their studies. This is Teresa\u2019s third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. The loan is needed to buy wire, different colored papers, glue, and other materials that are needed for pi\u00f1ata production. \r\n\r\nOnce again, the women of the Trust Bank \u201cEl Roble\u201d are very grateful for the confidence shown by the KIVA investors that has given them the opportunity to maintain and\/or augment their businesses. The loans have given them the ability to have a better quality of life for themselves and their families.

They have five children between the ages of 18 and 9 years old. Eight years ago, Josefa and her husband began a family business. The business generates income to cover the basic necessities for the family. She is currently asking for a new loan in order to buy fabrics of different textures and colors to produce more special orders for schoolchildren for the upcoming Guatemalan Independence Day festivals.\r\n\r\nJosefa is very grateful to the Kiva investors and to Friendship Bridge for their confidence in giving her and the members of her group loans that improve their businesses and thus improve the income of each family. The Friendship Bridge Microcredit Plus program that provides education in a variety of very important subjects, such as business management, budgeting, and marketing, as well as health, hygiene and self-empowerment, shows very positive results.

Recently, she applied for a loan to pay for the redemption of her pawned coconut land to have another source to pay her loan. In the future, Leonora wishes to become the supplier of flowers in the neighboring

The creator of the Company is Sarah. The idea for a travel- sharing website came from Sarah\u2019s love of traveling and storytelling. Growing up her family loved adventure, so their travels mostly included a pop-up camper and long road trips. With her parents and grandparents, Sarah traveled across the United States during summer school breaks. There are pictures of her standing on a boat in Niagara Falls, building sandcastles on Virginia Beach, and eating ice cream in a small town off the coast of Washington State. As an adult, Sarah still loves to travel and she wants to share her adventures with others via the internet. So that\u2019s how the idea of GoneVaca.com came about.\r\n\r\nGoneVaca.com is not only a website to upload pictures, videos, and vacation stories; it is a great resource for travelers. Members can post reviews, give travel advice, and give travel tips about their vacations. Then members can chat with other members about vacation destinations. As a social media site and not a business review site, GoneVaca.com will be centered on the members' personal travel experience. As a traveler, Sarah loves the concept of being able to contact and chat with other travelers before booking a trip.\r\n \r\nStarting a social media website has been a challenge. GoneVaca.com is not selling a product; it gives people a way to connect about traveling. So finding the right developers to bring the dream to life was a challenge. But with the Kiva funding, Sarah found the right website developers and will use the money to make GoneVaca.com a reality. Sarah hope that GoneVaca.com will give people a way to tell their travel stories, find great travel information, and make traveling friends.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for supporting GoneVaca.com. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1678288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tourism","sector":"Services","themes":["Kiva City LA"],"use":" to develop a web and mobile application ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Los Angeles","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":228,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":28,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":193.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":194.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":197.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":198.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":199.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":202.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":203.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":206.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":207.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":210.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":211.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":214.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":218.43},{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":219.84},{"due_date":"2016-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":221.26},{"due_date":"2016-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":222.68},{"due_date":"2016-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":224.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.43},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.84},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.26},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.68},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":763779,"name":"Arvin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arvin is single.

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nJudalyn is taking out a PHP 10,000 loan to buy supplies and other materials needed in her business. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and other items which are necessary to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of success in her rug-making business. She only hopes for her family to be always happy. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1685580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To pay for raw materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T18:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T18:20:11Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judalyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.69,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T11:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542492083},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625274},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2329.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535417},{"amount":13.34,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:50:44Z","rounded_local_amount":582.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595133771}],"funded_date":"2014-09-06T21:00:45Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:50:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":763804,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene has sold fried chicken and other cooked meals in her community for almost two years to earn an income.

This affects Majed's business negatively, because he doesn't have a power generator inside his workshop to enable him to continue in his business when the power cut. Majed doesn't have enough money to buy one. For this reason, he applied for a Youth loan of 200,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase a power generator for his iron workshop.\r\n\r\nMajed looks forward to purchasing a piece of land and building his own house on it.

Although she experiences challenges in farming, her attitude keeps her going. Enjoying what she does, she has even nicknamed her cow \u201clektina\u201d. \r\n\r\nIsabella is seeking a 21,700 KES loan to be able to buy a dairy cow and increase the number from the three that she currently has. With the loan, she would be able to increase her milk productivity and also increase her income levels, hence reducing the poverty level that is currently facing her.

Meet Esther, 52, a hardworking and honest farmer, who is based in Eldoret area in Kenya. She is a proud mother of three lovely children. For the past ten years, she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. \r\n\r\nEsther passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan, which she used to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. \r\n\r\nEsther is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day. A liter of milk costs 50 KES; this means she will be making 11 USD a day. From this loan, the life of Esther will permanently change and she will be able to secure the future of her school going children. She will also assure her aging parents of a secure future.

His clothing line \u2018Unity Wear\u2019 has become the focus of his energies, and the platform by which he gives back. \u2018Unity Wear\u2019 is unique because it is a socially conscious clothing line. It strives to bring awareness about issues like human trafficking, and its mission is uniting people around a common cause and creating a movement of solidarity.    \r\n\r\nMarcus will use this loan to purchase inventory and update his website. \r\n \r\nMarcus understands how much money can make or break a project. For this reason, he is allocating a portion of the profits of \u2018Unity Wear\u2019 to charities that contribute to the lives of women and children worldwide.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1684814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase inventory and update his website.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New Jersey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":132.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":101.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":103.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":105.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":109.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":108.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":110.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":111.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":113.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":114.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":118.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":119.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":121.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":122.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":124.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":126.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":129.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.65},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":761121,"name":"Pablo Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pablo es casado y tiene 3 hijos de 1, 4 y 6 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la casa que le presta su madre, son 5 a\u00f1os que Pablo y su esposa se dedican a este negocio, pero hace 3 a\u00f1os cuando Fodemi les di el cr\u00e9dito pudieron mejorarlo y readecuar sus galpones, adicionalmente se dedican a la agricultura de alg\u00fan huerto peque\u00f1o,  el esta ocasi\u00f3n  Pablo va a invertir el cr\u00e9dito en la  compra de pollos para ponerlos en un galp\u00f3n que en la actualidad esta vacio, lo que Pablo aspira es seguir trabajando duro para que sus hijos sigan estudiando y mejorar su calidad de vida.","en":"Pablo is married and has three children who are 1, 4, and 6 years old.

It is the second largest city in Guatemala. The official language is Spanish but they also speak the Maya languages of K\u2019iche and Mam. The women of Quetzaltenango make very elaborate clothes such as the Maya huipiles (blouse) and cortes (skirt), skirts, tablecloths, napkins, bibs, and center pieces. Also, many of the people do trading.  It is in this place that the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cGenesis\u201d was formed with seven members who sell used clothing, beauty products, and crafts. One of the women has a store selling snacks. It is important to point out that most of the young indigenous women wear their beautiful typical clothing \u2013 huipiles and cortes. \r\n\r\nAstrid is a young 20-year-old woman who is single with a seven month old baby. She is secretary of the group. Because jobs were scarce, Astrid began her used clothing business three years ago. Her business was increasing so she needed more capital. That was why she joined the group and asked for her first loan in order to buy more clothing such as children\u2019s (a bestseller), women\u2019s and other items.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan cycle for Astrid.  She is anxious to receive training from Friendship Bridge\u2019s \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program where, at the monthly meetings, the group learns about business administration, budgeting, customer service, as well as self-esteem, identity, leadership, preventive health, and reproductive health among other topics. The \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of small loans and education has shown that it is an excellent combination with positive results.

Meet Elena.\r\n\r\nElena, 54, is a very dedicated mother who believes in hard work. She is happily married and blessed with five lovely children whom she often refers to as \u201cmy pride.\u201d She is based in Kapsowar, a small remote rural town in Kenya that has bad terrain and is characterized by drought and bad weather conditions. \r\n\r\nFor the past twenty years, Elena has been actively involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income is from milk and crop farming. Elena passionately loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of her cows \u201cKapseret.\u201d Milking Kapseret is her hobby and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Elena. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mom makes a living through selling milk, she faces the challenge of irrigating her farm and providing water to her animals. Kapsowar is a remote area without piped water or electricity. Since Elena is from a marginalized community, she is forced to walk long distances to search for water. She typically walks for two hours. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Elena is requesting a loan to buy a water tank. Most of the rain water in his area goes to waste and Elena wants to harvest the water and store it in a water tank. The loan will save Elena's time and allow her to irrigate her farm during dry seasons and increase her productivity. The increase in productivity will translate into more income, which will provide Elena with financial security. Elena will also use the stored water for home consumption. \r\n\r\nElena\u2019s dream is to increase her farming activities and provide her children with a proper education. Education is the only way that her children, who are from a marginalized community, can succeed.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":595.68,"image":{"id":1685672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Jesca, a wife,  mother and  small holder farmer who is based in Kapseret,  a remote village in Eldoret. This  area is known as \u201cthe city of champions\u201d because for every 10 people you meet, two are athletes. It's home to the best world record holders in long distance running. This mother of three has been practicing mixed farming for the past eight years; her primary sources of income have been milk and some vegetables she plants.\r\n\r\nJesca enjoys the returns she gets, but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. She has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by acquiring a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Jesca, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nJesca said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan request because they offer agriculture-based loans, and their interest rate is low and on a reducing scale. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Jesca hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1685686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-06T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-06T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2939.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3072.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3118.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3211.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3416.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3408.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3540.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3615.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3746.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3834.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3949.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4078.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4188.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4317.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.03,"local_amount":7123.92,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7191.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680763},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":3021.81,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3050.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625052},{"amount":18.29,"local_amount":1608.21,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1623.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194134},{"amount":66.38,"local_amount":5835.49,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5890.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262022},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2747.61,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2773.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264134},{"amount":71.83,"local_amount":6314.85,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6374.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600301},{"amount":83.71,"local_amount":7659,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7731.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.41,"payment_id":681377158},{"amount":67.61,"local_amount":6414.86,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6475.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.36,"payment_id":711505208},{"amount":130.2,"local_amount":12024.25,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":12138.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.56,"payment_id":752110444}],"funded_date":"2014-09-07T03:31:15Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":763904,"name":"Irma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irma is a 42-year-old married woman.

Her previous loan was a big help for her business, as she was able to purchase products for her direct selling business. The loan is also useful for the maintenance of her farm business. Her income from the loan assisted with their everyday expenditures at home. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan. It will be used to buy additional supplies and merchandise, such as clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics. The more items she has on display and available on hand the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from this business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She will also use a portion of the loan to improve her farm. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nNancy hopes that her business will grow more and maintain an increasing profit. She dreams of a prosperous life with her family.

She hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to the main campus of Moi University, and also home to some of the best athletes in the world. She is the proud mother of five lovely school-going children that she values and treasures and will go an extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. Ruth\u2019s primary source of income has been milk selling, crop farming, and poultry farming; through these ventures, she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been practicing farming for five years, and through those years, she has never regretted venturing into farming. Ruth sells her vegetables, eggs, and milk to the nearby market. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very thankful that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family and she has always yearned to have more dairy cows.  \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She has already identified the breed of cow that she will buy. The cow will produce between 15-20 liters of milk per day. This breed of cow will be producing milk referred to as \u201cthe ideal drinking milk\u201d because it will not lack an adequate amount of fat and will possess desirable quantities of protein. This cow will certainly boost milk production in her farm which will translate to more sales and better income for her and her family. Because of this high milk production potential, she will save more money to fully repay the loan. She believes that through careful selection and the application of the strict standard of excellence in keeping her dairy cow, she will have more income, which will improve her living

Some years ago, he migrated to Costa Rica seeking a better life. However, he had to return to his country more than 10 years ago to get away from the discrimination he suffered.  It should be noted that this experience was not entirely negative.  In fact, it helped him to fend for himself and led to him to start up his own grocery store business in order to get ahead with his 3 children, as he is a single father.  \r\n\r\nNow Victor is a high school graduate and a merchant.  He already has 10 years of hard work invested in his business.  Victor is very proud of his business because it has grown a lot, even though it is his only source of income.

She is 34 years old and lives in a common-law marriage; they have four children from this relationship. The older children are 17, 15, and 13 years old and are in school; the youngest is barely six months old. Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nVicenta is a wonderful woman who, to earn her own income, works selling hamburgers, tostadas, and other quick meals, along with juices and blended fruit drinks. She has a shop in her house where she sells her products from Friday to Sunday. On those days, there are many people who come to her shop. She has worked in this activity for more than three years and it is going very well for her. With her business, she earns her own money, which she invests in the education of her children, which to her is the most important thing.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy bread, sausages, meat, fruit, and other groceries for the quick meals. She has been in the Credit Group for two years and she likes it because of the help she gets from the loans. Her dream is to give her children the best."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1681650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy bread, sausages, meat, fruit, and other groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-09-07T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-07T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":742.82,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":92.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":371.4,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T12:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542516939},{"amount":187.49,"local_amount":185.7,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":187.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562429477},{"amount":187.51,"local_amount":185.72,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":187.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579565164}],"funded_date":"2014-09-07T06:32:53Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T12:21:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":763941,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia is a hard-working woman who tries her best to make both ends meet.

She is married to Hernane, a driver, and the mother of five children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJocelyn operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round, palm-sized ones to the much-larger doormats, braided quilts and bed sheets, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Jocelyn also earns additional income from a charcoal business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nJocelyn dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality of education through all her hard work on her business. She has hopes of becoming a successful businesswoman someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Dairy business is an important source of income to small-scale farmers in Kenya. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva to provide financial and technical solutions to poor farmers such as Joshua, a father of five children in the Kisii area of Kenya. Joshua has been a mixed farmer for the past six years, and his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and food crops. \r\n\r\nThe Kisii region area has a cool climate, but sometimes experiences long dry spells, and this accounts for major crop failure leading to starvation. Joshua is seeking a loan to purchase a high quality dairy cow. Easy availability of feed and fodder all year round makes dairy farming an ideal choice of investment in this region.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan Joshua will be able to fully satisfy the demand of milk that is in his village and through increased income, he will be able to improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be very important because it will not only improve Joshua\u2019s life, but also he will be able to get manure, which will be used on his farm and improve productivity.\r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, Joshua has been trained on how to save money, and he plans to use the extra income to increase his business and is planning to buy another dairy cow.

agricultural institute, but she is an accomplished farmer from Kapsowar area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. She is happily married and, together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with 4 children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 2 years she has been involved in mixed farming and because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. Joan has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nDairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Joan, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nJoan said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. \r\n\r\nJoan hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1685845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-07T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-07T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":26875,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1631.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1964.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2045.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2084.02},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2146.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2259.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2277.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2357.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2415.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2494.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2561.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2637.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.59,"local_amount":4266.34,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4578.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680768},{"amount":24.67,"local_amount":2039.7,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2189.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625057},{"amount":27.17,"local_amount":2246.63,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2411.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194139},{"amount":55.02,"local_amount":4549.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4882.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262026},{"amount":56.5,"local_amount":4671.72,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5013.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600304},{"amount":105.74,"local_amount":9100.94,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9767.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.31,"payment_id":681377162}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T13:06:45Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":764020,"name":"Stephen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello world, meet Stephen!  \r\n\r\nStephen is a 40 year-old father of 4 who practices mixed farming for a living.

Despite their marginalised status in society, productivity gains by smallholders will significantly drive poverty reduction. \r\n\r\nCharles, 26, comes from Nandi Hills, which is a small agricultural town in the Great Rift Valley.  He sustains his one child through selling milk, eggs and crops from his farm. He is also engaged in other side businesses since he is not making enough income. \r\n\r\nLike Charles, many rural smallholder farmers are still snared in poverty and they face a set of common challenges preventing them from escaping this trap. The biggest problem smallholders face throughout the region is lack of sufficient access to land, which makes it difficult for them to boost their incomes significantly. \r\n\r\nCharles is seeking a loan to purchase a piece of land. This will make him have legal rights over the property and increase his agricultural output. This will enable him to make enough income to afford business related expenses that are too high for him at the moment. \r\n\r\nCharles stated that he will use the loan to raise the living standards of his family. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1685851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase land ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-07T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-07T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3036.14},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3655.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3805.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3877.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3992.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4202.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4236.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4385.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4493.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4641.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4765.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4907.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":764015,"name":"Aramanzani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aramazan is 55 years old, married with four children and living in Kasese, Uganda.

Meet Nelly, a 50 year old mother who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Nelly is a mother of four lovely children that she really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. \r\n\r\nNelly hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Nelly never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Nelly started farming and has been doing farming for the past 3 years. Through those years she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. \r\n\r\nNelly practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits she has managed to take care of her family's needs and also give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. Nelly is a woman who is very enterprising and she is seeking a loan of KES 65,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Nelly wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Nelly to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Nelly hopes that through the loan she will improve her living conditions. Nelly's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Nelly is not a selfish woman and will also want to impact positively on society that is why she will employ people to work for her on her horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1685870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He also runs a bakery in Villa Juliana, near city of La Paz, where he prepares and sells bread. Andres, his wife, and their three children share a home with her parents, her brother, and his family. \r\n\r\nAndres is a creative, tenacious, patient, and hardworking businessman. His bakery is in an area that has become linked to the city of La Paz. Bolivia\u2019s economic troubles have hit the provinces of Ingavi, Pacajes, Los Andes, Omasuyos and Manco Kapac hard, and driving rural residents to the capital. Migrants from the countryside have arrived and been unable to find a place to live in the capital, so many have settled in Villa Juliana. \r\n\r\nAndres has a brown complexion, short hair, and is of medium height. His native language is Aymara, which he speaks with his family and with some of his customers. Andres is fully bilingual and can speak to anyone in Spanish. \r\n\r\nThe bakery is located in the home of his wife\u2019s parents. Andres worked in a bakery for over 15 years before going into business for himself, and, with his wife\u2019s help, purchased an industrial oven. Every morning just before sunrise, he goes out on his motorbike, carrying baskets filled with bread, and makes deliveries to his customers. He quickly dismounts, leaves the bread at the customer\u2019s door, then rushes to his next delivery. Andres then returns to the bakery to prepare more bread for customers in other neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nAndres hopes to expand his bakery and employ a larger staff so he can reach more customers. The bakery now needs wholesale supplies, such as white flour, butter, milk, and other ingredients. Andres is hopeful that investing in these goods will boost his income, and is therefore applying for a loan. He will use the additional income from the bakery to pay for his children\u2019s education.

Her business income is able only to pay for the costs of maintaining her home. She is requesting a new loan in order to buy more secondhand clothing, underwear, diapers and kerosene to cover all of her customer demands because without more investment capital, she feels that her own income is not sufficient. \r\n\r\nBesides the loans, Irene and the other members of Asesewa also benefit from a combination of loans and education (training). The loan officer and the training officer share timely and useful information with the members on a variety of subjects like health, hygiene and nutrition as well as self-esteem and violence against women. The members learn about effective business management practices and customer service, as well as gain essential knowledge about business planning, customer service, marketing and pricing.

She lives with her son, daughter-in-law and  one-year-old grandson. \r\n\r\nEghisapet is the main breadwinner of the family. Her salary, however, is not enough to effectively meet her family's needs. To be able to cover those needs, Eghisapet is also engaged in breeding livestock (calves and hens) and in the cultivation of barley and tomatoes. She sells the agricultural products in the local market, and this is a very important source of the family's income. Her son assists her greatly in everyday activities related to farming. \r\n\r\nEghisapet currently needs to make some investments in her agribusiness in order for it to function in a sustainable way. She needs a loan of 3,000 USD to purchase fertilizer, fuel, and forage for the livestock. She has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during recent times, Eghisapet was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments.

She is a member of the group and is very excited to begin a sixth loan cycle with ID-Ghana, Teshie branch. Grace sells maize. Her business income is able only to pay for the costs of maintaining her home. She is requesting a new loan in order to buy three sacks of maize to cover all of her customer demand because without more investment capital, she feels that her own income is not sufficient. \r\n\r\nBesides the loans, Grace and the other members of Krobor Bukom also benefit from a combination of loans and education (training). The loan officer and the training officer share timely and useful information with the members on a variety of subjects like health, hygiene, and nutrition as well as self-esteem and violence against women. The members learn about effective business management practices and customer service, as well as gaining essential knowledge about business planning, customer service, marketing and pricing. All of these subjects help them better their lives both economically and developmentally."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1685898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy three sacks of maize to cover all of her customer demand.

Introducing Edward, a 40-year-old father who is full of energy and a very hard worker. He hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area with good and favorable weather patterns that support farming. He is a father of two children who are under his care from his marriage. Edward completed his secondary school education thanks to the financial support and effort of his parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit he had for succeeding in life. \r\n\r\nEdward has been farming for the past two years, and through mixed farming, he has been able to take care of his family. He loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows 'Lelmet' (from a person's name). Although Edward passionately loves farming, he faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why he is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Edward comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will assist him to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also to store water for home consumption. Harvested water will assist Edward to irrigate his farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops. \r\n\r\nThis loan will turn the life of Edward around as he will no longer have to walk long distances in search of water, hence saving more time and generating the energy and time to his farm.

Meet Elizabeth, a 50-year-old youthful shosho (old mum), very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of four children. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Kapsowar, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nElizabeth passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past five years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. \r\n\r\nIn farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. Elizabeth has identified free space in her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and the price of milk in the recent past has been going up, so Elizabeth, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nElizabeth said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her  school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1685914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-07T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-07T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3203.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3856.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4014.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4212.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4433.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4469.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4626.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4740.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4896.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5027.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5177.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.41,"local_amount":8739.94,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8822.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680774},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":4020,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4058.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625062},{"amount":50.32,"local_amount":4424.14,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4466.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194145},{"amount":101.95,"local_amount":8962.93,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9047.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262031},{"amount":108.63,"local_amount":9550.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9641.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600310},{"amount":159.96,"local_amount":14637.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":14776.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.53,"payment_id":681377166},{"amount":25.98,"local_amount":2415.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2438.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.49,"payment_id":731022099}],"funded_date":"2014-09-10T17:35:28Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":761649,"name":"Luz Dary","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 51 a\u00f1os de edad Luz es madre soltera y  tiene 6 hijos, mismos que ya son mayores de edad, Luz vive con una hija y 3 nietas,  Luz se dedica al jornal del trabajo en el  campo y a la crianza de animales menores, ella se dedica a la crianza de pollos desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, el cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para comprar pollos y de esta manera mejorar su negocio, tambi\u00e9n desea adecuar los galpones para criar sus pollos, lo que Luz aspira es readecuar los galpones  y por medio los ingresos  de su trabajo diario y su negocio  comprarse un terreno donde pueda sembrar alg\u00fan producto para ayudar a su hija y sus nietas.","en":"Luz is a 51-year-old, single mother of six adult children who lives with one of her daughters and three granddaughters.

Meet 23-year-old Samson, a very young, hard-working and energetic farmer. He hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area that is blessed with good climatic conditions and favorable weather patterns that favor farming. \r\n\r\nSamson is still single and has been doing farming for the past two years. He was raised in a humble family, and he never got the opportunity to go to college because of a lack of tuition funds. As a result of this, he never got any formal employment - but he didn\u2019t surrender to that. He started farming, and through farming he has been able to take care of himself and also to take care of his aging parents. \r\n\r\nSamson's source of income are vegetables, milk, and eggs; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time.  Kapsowar area has bad terrain, poor road networks and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Samson is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Through the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nSamson is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. His dream is to save more profits and go back to school, study hard and be an agricultural extension officer; with your loan he is sure of realizing his dream. \r\n\r\nHelp Samson realize his dream by investing in him through this loan!"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1685926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-07T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-07T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4386.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4566.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4652.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5043.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5084.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5262.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5392.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5569.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5718.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5889.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brian Arens"}},{"id":764122,"name":"Sitidia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sitidia is 30 years old and has been in the business for four years.

Today, this humble mother of four children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village.Taking care of her poultry is an activity that she finds very enjoyable, and feeding her poultry is her hobby. \r\n\r\nPoultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Kapsowar area. Florence has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market - the demand is very high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry, so now she is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nAccessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Florence can achieve their dreams and goals.
