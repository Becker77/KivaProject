Philippines. Her husband is a operator\/driver. They are blessed with five children. Because it is hard for them to survive if only her husband is working, she decided to engage herself in selling.  She started a sari-sari (mini- grocery) store with a capital of 3,000PHP. Their primary customers are their neighbours. Successfully, she was able to manage it well and able to finance the daily needs of her family with the help of Paglaum Cooperative, which she became a member of last in November 2009.

and other products used to sustain life. Agriculture in Kenya continues to dominate Kenya\u2019s economy, and is also the largest contributor to Kenya\u2019s gross domestic product.\r\n\r\nCharles, 40, started farming approximately six years ago, and although he began farming as a hobby, it eventually became his career. His half-acre of land located in the Kapsowar area of Kenya houses poultry and dairy cows. Charles passionately loves poultry farming. The Kapsowar area is populated, and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Charles' biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nPoultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and you don\u2019t need to be a large scale farmer to benefit from it. Through the loan, Charles will be able to sell eggs, meat, and poultry feathers to the already existing market. The demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in his area. \r\n\r\nCharles has been facing challenges accessing finances, but he feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Charles chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loans is low, and is on a reducing basis. Charles underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through the loan, Charles' income will increase and his life will permanently change, leading to better living conditions for his family and a positive impact to the community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1686379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-07T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-07T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1821.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2193.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2283.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2326.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2395.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2521.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2542.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2631.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2784.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2859.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.33,"local_amount":4913.91,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5079.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680778},{"amount":26.32,"local_amount":2256.38,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2332.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625067},{"amount":29,"local_amount":2485.81,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2569.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194150},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":5133.55,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5306.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262035},{"amount":177.46,"local_amount":15210.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":15722.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600314}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T00:30:48Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":764326,"name":"Sobia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sobia is 29, married and blessed with one child.

Gideon is 35 years of age and one of the most hardworking men in his village of Koibarak, in the area of Kapsowar in Kenya. He has a wife and 4 children and wanted to lay a good foundation for his family and grandchildren to come. That is why he started farming and has been practising mixed farming for the past 2 years. His primary sources of income have been eggs, crops, and some personal business that he does so as to accumulate more wealth.\r\n\r\nGideon is very passionate about dairy farming and, as he always says, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart.\u201d He has nicknamed his dairy cow \u201cBirirmet.\u201d Dairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth, and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed. This has translated to increased earnings for farmers. Gideon, being a very hardworking and visionary farmer, will want to take advantage of the ready market; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to buy a good-quality breed of dairy cow.\r\n\r\nGideon has already decided what type of dairy breed he requires and, because of his immense knowledge on preparing hay, his cows will have plenty of food and will produce more milk. Gideon projects that the cow he acquires through the loan will be producing more than 10 liters a day.\r\n\r\nBecause there is a ready market for milk, he does not worry too much about competition and marketing the milk will not be a challenge. He will be selling it directly to the market as well as to big dairy-processing firms, which will result in increased earnings. Additionally, Gideon has planned that instead of selling the milk in its raw form, he will be packaging the milk, and this will also improve his income.

This is not true for Naomi, 22, who is based in the Eldoret area of Kenya and is a mother of one lovely daughter, she has been practicing mixed farming for the past seven years. She has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nShe passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking Lelmet (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. \r\n\r\nThe dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nNaomi is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also to start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future.

Meet Ann, 27 a mother of 4 who has defied the notion among her friends that farming is an old-fashioned way of earning a living. Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs and farming. \r\n\r\nAnn hails from Eldoret, Kenya, an area that enjoys favorable weather patterns and this boosts crop production in the area. Ann being someone who is very ambitious and someone who always takes advantage of positive things would like to capitalize on the good weather patterns experienced in the region and boost her farming. Being a hardworking mother, Ann has always ensured that she puts food on the table for her family. She also ensures she is able to take her children to school. \r\n\r\nAnn detests living in conditions of poverty and she has a plan to improve her standard of living. This is why she is seeking a loan of 52,750 KES in order to be able to purchase a dairy cow.  This will help in producing milk and manure to be used on her farm. Milk from the cow will be sold to the local market and this means improved cash flow. Through improved cash flow this means that profits will be higher and she can comfortably take care of her family and take her kids to school. \r\n\r\nThrough your loan Ann will be empowered economically and be able to improve her standard of living and also those of people living within the area. Ann is very comfortable with the repayment plan and the monthly installments."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":507.5,"image":{"id":1686521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an additional dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-08T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-08T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2312.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2939.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3072.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3118.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3211.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3416.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3408.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3540.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3615.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3746.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3834.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3949.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4078.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4188.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4317.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.03,"local_amount":7123.92,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":7179.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680784},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":3021.81,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3045.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625073},{"amount":18.37,"local_amount":1614.62,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1627.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823510},{"amount":33.54,"local_amount":2948.63,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2971.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262038},{"amount":34.69,"local_amount":3049.77,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3073.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264144},{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":3860.35,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3890.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600317},{"amount":78.38,"local_amount":6891.32,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6944.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458871},{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":7351.57,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7408.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.41,"payment_id":681377174},{"amount":92.11,"local_amount":8755.46,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8823.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.48,"payment_id":711505215}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T23:44:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":764469,"name":"Rhuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rhuel, 35, a resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite City, Philippines.

He is a 40-year-old farmer from Nyamira town in the Lake region of Kenya. The place is widely known for banana growing. The area's constituents' staple meal is locally known as 'Matoke', a traditional meal made from raw bananas. The area is rain fed, fertile, and hilly. \r\n\r\nAbel is a father of two who has been doing mixed farming for more than three years now. He loves his job and spends a lot of time tending to his farm. However, he faces a couple of challenges day to day. His main challenge is lack of capital to acquire modern tools and equipment. This makes his work slow and strenuous.\r\n\r\nAbel is seeking a loan to purchase a water pump, water pipes, and a water storage tank. These pieces of equipment will make his life much easier on the farm. Instead of making trips to the spring back and forth carrying small quantities of water, a water pump will simply pump water constantly from the spring into the tanks through water pipes. This will save him a lot of time and effort. This will also ensure no more water shortages since the water is stored. \r\nInvesting your loan in Abel will bring him and his family untold benefits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1686544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water pump, pipes, and a tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-08T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-08T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2924.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3044.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3101.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3194.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3362.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3389.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3508.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3713.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3812.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3926.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":5743.16,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6042.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680785},{"amount":37.15,"local_amount":3128.39,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3291.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194155},{"amount":75.09,"local_amount":6323.77,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6653.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823511},{"amount":41.3,"local_amount":3478.01,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3659.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264145},{"amount":39.96,"local_amount":3364.78,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3540.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600318},{"amount":79.33,"local_amount":6964.73,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7327.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.38,"payment_id":681377175},{"amount":80.91,"local_amount":7366.76,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7750.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.57,"payment_id":711505216},{"amount":40.7,"local_amount":3630.4,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3819.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.41,"payment_id":731022104}],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T00:05:45Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":764489,"name":"Bega Kwa Bega Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngeme is a widow who was born in the 1950s.

She is a woman in her late twenties from a community not known for farming, but she has been earning so much through agriculture. For the past 15 years, her primary source of income has been milk, tea, and a variety of crops she plants. \r\n\r\nShe is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit, and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.

Since she has excess dairy food and enough space on her land, Sharon has always wanted to buy another dairy cow, but the challenge that she has been facing is lack of finances. That is why Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Sharon to turn their dreams into reality. Sharon believes that the loan will help her to satisfy the milk demand in her area and, through the accumulated profits, she will be able to realize her dream of developing her business into a large enterprise.\r\n\r\nMany women in Kenya are responsible for not only producing food, but also feeding their family. Sharon, being a hardworking farmer, wants to provide all of the basic needs that her child and parents require. Sharon is very disciplined with her finances and she knows that, with the accumulated profits, she will be able to fully repay her loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":390.28,"image":{"id":1686553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-08T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-08T03:20:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2513.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2540.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2616.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2816.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2778.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2896.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2947.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3064.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3126.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3219.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3335.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3414.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3530.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3621.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3729.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3851.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.23,"local_amount":6715.87,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6842.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194157},{"amount":66.09,"local_amount":5747.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5855.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262040},{"amount":67.03,"local_amount":5828.39,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5938.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600320},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":6186.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6303.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.91,"payment_id":681377177},{"amount":70.07,"local_amount":6587.87,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6712.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.69,"payment_id":711505217},{"amount":31.39,"local_amount":2872.08,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2926.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"payment_id":752110448}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T20:46:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":764537,"name":"Risper","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Risper is a young ambitious farmer based in the Kisii area of Kenya.

Meet Lydia: a young farmer from Chebara -- a remote village in Kapsowar, Kenya -- who has defied the common notion among most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. Lydia is happily married and she and her husband are blessed with 4 children.\r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income are milk and tomatoes that she plants on her farm. She also engages in personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. She practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the varied agricultural training she has been receiving to broaden her skills.\r\n\r\nAlthough she earns handsome profits from farming, she faces one big challenge, and that is high prices of fertilizers, seedlings and inputs. This is as a result of the monopoly that is enjoyed by the only agro-vet shop in her area. Lydia is requesting a loan to start an agro-vet shop. The Chebara area has only one agro-dealer who is catering to thousands of small-time farmers who depend upon him solely for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them extra, since he is the only agro dealer and he enjoys a monopoly. Lydia wants to change this and seize the business opportunity. With your loan, she will start an agro-vet shop and tap into the potential agricultural market. Lydia will also help the small-time farmers in her area who have been having serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs for a long time.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Lydia will change from the miserable peasant farmer she is right now to a certified agro dealer who will be depended upon by close to 5,000 small-time farmers in her area both for inputs, knowledge and information about improved inputs.

All hail from Thiruneelakudi village of Trichy in Tamil Nadu. Most of them are daily wage laborers and help supplement their household income. These diligent women are unable to save money from their monthly income. A major chunk of their income goes towards buying firewood or kerosene, and a lot of their time is spent cooking over traditional \u2018chulha\u2019 stoves. These chulhas, apart from being time consuming, emit a lot of smoke, which plays havoc with their health. This adds to their medical expenses.\r\n \r\nHence, to tackle these problems, they have approached PAT (Micrograam\u2019s field partner) to buy Greenway cook stoves. The benefits of the Greenway cook stove are that: it leads to fuel savings, uses all solid fuels, minimizes emissions of CO, CO2, supports fast and convenient cooking, is highly durable, and is maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. Hence, they are seeking a group loan repayable in easy installments. They intend to use the loan to purchase Greenway cook stoves. Your loan will help these women to have better health and save a little more money.

world! Meet Peter, a farmer in Siongiroi. Peter is involved in maize, poultry and dairy farming. He engages in milk and egg production for commercial purposes as opposed to many rural farmers who are in it for subsistence. Peter also grows maize for food and sales. These commercial activities place him in a better position to engage in other agriculture-related businesses, which, in fact, he does.\r\n  \r\nPeter is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cow shed. This will help significantly in managing the animals\u2019 health and hygiene. He has been in the farming business for at least 10 years. He has no plans to quit in the future as he finds farming to be not only fulfilling but also lucrative. However, his biggest challenges are the poor road network and lack of market.

Carlos is 34 years old, dynamic and hard-working and for over twenty years he has worked in farming. Carlos is very grateful for his last Kiva loan offered through MiCr\u00e9dito as he used it to buy manure and fertiliser to look after his land. This allowed him to grow a successful yield of maize, giving him more customers and a higher income.\r\n\r\nCarlos works hard in order to offer his children - twelve and six years old - a good quality education. Carlos himself did not go to school and wants his children to have the opportunity that he did not. As a result, with a desire to continue moving forward, Carlos is applying for a second loan in order to buy two hundredweights of manure and two hundredweights of urea, and to pay labourers to grow sweet peppers.

experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe started decorating as a hobby from home two years ago. Neysa enjoyed planning events for her family and friends and created custom pieces for each event. Throughout the course of developing her craft, she decided to turn her hobby into a career. \u201cMy decor business is based on three things: vision, design and presentation,\u201d Neysa said. \u201cWhen all the pieces come together, it\u2019s a wonderful sight to see everyone marveling at what we\u2019ve created.\u201d\r\n\r\nLuxur\u00e9 Decor offers specialized packages catering to the budget and style preferences of clients. She gives her clients a taste of luxury at a reasonable price. From centerpieces to program styles, Neysa says her team utilizes their talents to form one-of-a-kind creations that are truly awe inspiring. Her business is in its first few months of operation and she is currently working to increase her customer base and create marketing materials.  After building a stronger client list, Neysa would like to hire two designers to help her with new concepts for design packages. \r\n\r\n\u201cThis all began from a simple hobby,\u201d Neysa said. \u201cMy ultimate dream is to turn Luxur\u00e9 Decor into a retail brand.\u201d She came to Accion Texas to help fund her new website, company flyers, and business cards. In the next year, Neysa would like to open a storefront business. For now, Neysa is focused on building her brand.

She also works hard with the determination of having better income.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Genalyn would like to apply for a new loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. With PHP 50,000, she could purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nGenalyn hopes that her variety store will soon become a convenience store. She also wants her family to have a stable source of income.

Initially,  eight women made up the group and they are deeply grateful for the line of credit that was granted to them a year ago.  The women have completely paid the loan back with great success.  In the previous cycle, we reported the case of Juliana, now 41 years old, married with six children.  Thanks to her textile business,  predominantly making huipiles (Maya blouses), Juliana has successfully had the ability to provide an education for her children.  She mentioned that without the working capital, the group\u2019s businesses could not grow.  Thus, their families\u2019 well being would not improve.\r\n\r\nThe group is currently initiating a new loan cycle with nine members, six of whom have already finished several cycles along with three new members.   One of the new members is Mayra, a young woman of 23 years who recently began her own family.  She is the mother of a beautiful seven month-old baby.  Her husband is a carpenter.  Mayra\u2019s business is the making of beautiful aprons that she delivers once a week throughout the community.  She is very excited to begin her first loan cycle.  She plans to use the money to buy fabric of a variety of colors and textures so that her business can grow in size and income. \r\n\r\nBesides the loan, Mayra will receive monthly lessons from the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of Friendship Bridge.  These lessons will give her the opportunity to develop her leadership and decision making abilities.  Friendship Bridge has found that the combination of small loans along with education in subjects like business management, budgeting, accounting, marketing, customer service, as well as health, hygiene and self-esteem provides very positive results.  \r\n\r\nAll the women of the Trust Bank \u201cBuganvilia\u201d are extremely grateful for the confidence that Friendship Bridge and Kiva investors have shown them and are also grateful for the opportunity to receive more working capital.

She is a mother many times over, as she has 6 daughters. She also had a son, but he passed away last year. Tazhigul is a pensioner. As her main source of income, she has been practicing livestock breeding and crop farming for almost her entire life. Currently, Tazhigul has 1 dairy cow and 30 sheep on her farm, as well as a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans. Her daughters and grandchildren help her with her farm. Tazhigul wants to be independent and not take money from her children, as they need to support their own families. This is why Tazhigul turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 60,000 som (KGS) to buy a dairy cow to increase her sales of eco-friendly, delicious milk. A portion of the loan, specifically 20,000 som (KGS), will be spent on hiring workers to help her harvest her beans. Tazhigul plans to sell her eco-friendly beans to local processing factories. The earnings from the loan will allow Tazhigul to improve her family's living conditions and develop her business in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1685969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a dairy cow to increase her eco-friendly milk sales, as well as to hire workers to harvest her eco-friendly beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kok-Dobo village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-09-08T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-08T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":172.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tazhigul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":977.08,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":60907.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":172.92,"payment_id":730933303}],"funded_date":"2014-09-08T17:47:07Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":764796,"name":"Ma.

The problem is, if Maryana were to take money from her business for this, it would negatively affect her income overall. This is why she needs additional funds. <br \/><br \/>The most important thing that Maryana will spend this money on is repairing her roof, which has been leaking here and there for a long time. However, she also wants to do a small, cosmetic renovation to her house, specifically replacing the old doors, toilet, tiles and bathtub in her bathroom.

He has three large greenhouses and another three greenhouses for seedlings. All of them having heating systems. Grigoryi primarily grows tomatoes and cucumbers. Grigoryi has lived his whole life in the village, in his own home and has always been in farming. Previously, he worked on a collective farm, then this type of work was eliminated, so he began growing cucumbers.<br \/><br \/>As he needs to buy necessities for the next growing season, Grigoryi needs additional funds in the amount of 40,000 hryvnia (UAH) - 15,000 hryvnia (UAH) to buy plastic covering and 25,000 hryvnia (UAH) to buy coal. With the profits from the loan, Grigoryi really hopes to finish his home repairs. Not long ago, he put in windows and did small internal renovations. The repairs he has left are to re-cover the roof, which is completely in disrepair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1686042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase plastic covering and coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Novovodyanoye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-09-08T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-08T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1208.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grigoryi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":989.41,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-20T12:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20057.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":610.59,"payment_id":697342871},{"amount":592.65,"local_amount":11800,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11833.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":351.35,"payment_id":711494696},{"amount":256.56,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5014.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":143.44,"payment_id":731013197},{"amount":152.76,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3209.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":103.24,"payment_id":752101485}],"funded_date":"2014-09-21T16:25:55Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T15:57:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":764906,"name":"Kalina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kalina is 20 years old, single, and has one child.
