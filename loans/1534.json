","en":"Alexander grows vegetables on his own plot of land in Kamenka. He started this business 21 years ago. Her currently has 8 large greenhouses with heating systems. He primarily grows tomatoes and cucumbers. Three years ago, Alexander was unloading lumber for his greenhouse heating systems when one of the lumber beams broke his leg. As he was already an older man, it took his leg a long time to heal. He used crutches for almost two years. It was difficult for him to work so he had to hire someone to accomplish even basic tasks for his business. Now everything is healed, but he tries not to put a lot of weight on his leg.<br \/><br \/>With the 40,000 hryvnia (UAH), he plans to buy fertilizer, plastic covering and seeds for Spring. He also wants to make repairs to one of his greenhouses, which needs to be ready for the next planting season. Eventually, he needs to delineate his plot of land, put up a good fence and then he can make repairs to his house. Alexander also thinks that he needs to renovate his heating system, as a gas-based system could now be uneconomical."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1686045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase plastic covering, seeds and fertilizer and to fix one of his greenhouses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2014-09-08T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-08T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1206.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":989.41,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-20T12:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":20057.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":610.59,"payment_id":697342872},{"amount":1004.48,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20057.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":595.52,"payment_id":711494697}],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T07:07:38Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:22:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":763305,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 56-year-old Vilma from Cabagan.

She is married with 5 children, the oldest is 18 years and the youngest, 6 years old. All her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nMary is a peasant farmer who grows cassava, maize, yams, sweet potatoes, and produces palm oil.  She lives with her family at Gold Coast Camp in the Central Region of Ghana. Mary's main source of income is through the palm oil processing which she uses to support her husband to take care of the family. \r\n\r\nMary is a member of Odeakye Ye Group. The entire group has decided to use the Elsa clean cook stove.  Mary's main problem is that she can't get the total amount to buy the Elsa clean cook stove at hand to replace her open mud firewood stove.  Mary is very anxious to buy a clean stove to reduce indoor air pollution and to save the lives of her family. Besides, she will save the money she now uses in buying firewood because she can get the fuel for the clean stove (virgin pellet) from her oil processing.  \r\n\r\nTogether with her group members, she is very happy because using the clean stove will protect her family and community at large.

He is a hardworking man who has worked as a day laborer for 15 years. His life partner helps him financially, and thanks to their work, the two are able to support their daughters.

","en":"Volodya has already applied for financial assistance from KIVA in the past. In due course, he used to last loan he received from KIVA to install a large boiler for heating his greenhouses. Now he has three more large greenhouses that he has heating systems in. This allowed Volodya to successfully sow two harvests - one in the early Spring and one in the Fall - without being afraid of frost. This also spurred a noticeable increase in revenue from clients.

The neighborhood is also known because a factory that had been an important source of jobs closed more than 15 years ago.  Now the building can be seen from afar.\r\n\r\nThe members and their jobs are: Silviana raises and sells pigs, Esperanza sells groceries, Nicolaza sells groceries, and Concepci\u00f3n sells clothing and corn.  Esperanza's a very hardworking, happy, and friendly woman who opened a grocery store 18 years ago thanks to her husband's support.

She knows she'll offer her customers a better selection with this variety of merchandise.\r\n\r\nEsperanza explained what she likes most about her job: the way her customers make her laugh.  Besides, this type of business allows her to stay at home and not neglect her family while she's earning an income.\r\n\r\nThe fours members of the group are grateful to Kiva and to VisionFund

The sales are going well, but the only problem is that prices for everything in the Ukraine are going up fast, and sometimes he has to sell products at one price and buy another inventory for a lot more than he sold the previous one at. On top of that, a lot of money is going toward his son's education, who is graduating from a university this year. This time, Sergei requested a loan in the amount of 35 000 hryvnia, needed to buy seeds and coal for the next season.

Meet Andrea, a 55 year old father who is humble, honest and a very hardworking father. He is the father of four lovely children that he really adores so much that he will do anything good to ensure that they never go to bed hungry. Andrea hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Andrea never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white collar job but this did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life. Andrea started farming and has been doing farming for the past three years. Through those years he has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Andrea practices mixed farming on his farm and through the profits he has managed to take care of his family's needs and also give his children a good education (because he believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d).\r\n\r\nAndrea is a father who is very enterprising and he is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES to start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Andrea wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring people like Andrea to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing.\r\n\r\nAndrea hopes that through the loan he will improve his living conditions. His dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year he will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this he will be able to assure his children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because he will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Andrea is not a selfish person and will also want to impact positively on society by employing people to work for him on his horticulture farm."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1687445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1214.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1462.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1522.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1550.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1597.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1681.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1694.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1754.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1797.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1856.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1963.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":3343.5,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3705.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680798},{"amount":19.25,"local_amount":1539.86,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625085},{"amount":21.17,"local_amount":1693.32,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1876.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194171},{"amount":42.9,"local_amount":3431.82,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3802.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262053},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":3656.77,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4052.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600335},{"amount":46.93,"local_amount":3911.07,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4333.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.96,"payment_id":681377190},{"amount":28.03,"local_amount":2423.66,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2685.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"payment_id":711505229}],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T19:01:44Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":765072,"name":"Marigen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marigen is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a business selling dry goods in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to purchase more stocks of dry goods like rope, hats, mirrors, etc. to sell.\r\n\r\nMarigen has been in this business for 10 years.

common thinking about most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. She is the mother of four children who has been doing farming for the last two years so that she can supplement her income from the salary she gets. Linah does crop farming and cattle keeping and she enjoys farming a lot. Her biggest challenges are the lack of finances to improve her farming and diseases. This has made her seek a loan of KES 20,000 to purchase a sheep. With this sheep, her projections are that by the end of the year the sheep will have given birth to at least four other sheep. Through sheep keeping, she will be able to get sheep wool, which is very expensive and fetches more profits. This translates to more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also, she will be able to sell sheep meat and sheepskin, which will be increasing her income level. The profits will be used to repay the loan on time and grow the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1687485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1214.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1462.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1522.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1550.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1597.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1681.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1694.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1754.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1797.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1856.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1963.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.03,"local_amount":7122.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":7892.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680801},{"amount":22.24,"local_amount":1779.31,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1971.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625086},{"amount":24.17,"local_amount":1933.41,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2142.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194175},{"amount":114.56,"local_amount":9164.98,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10155.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458878}],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T03:18:50Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":765114,"name":"Jinky","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jinky is studying at university for she believes that with better education, her future is at hand.

All hail from Viragalur village in Trichy in Tamil Nadu. Most of them are daily wage laborers and help supplement their household income. These diligent women are unable to save money from their monthly income. A major chunk of their income goes towards buying firewood or kerosene, and a lot of their time is spent cooking over traditional \"chulha\" stoves. These chulhas, apart from being time-consuming, also emit a lot of smoke, which plays havoc with their health. This adds to their medical expenses.\r\n \r\nHence, to tackle these problems, they have approached PAT (Micrograam\u2019s field partner) to buy Greenway cook stoves. The benefits of the Greenway cook stove are that: it leads to fuel savings, uses all solid fuels, minimizes emissions of CO, CO2, supports fast and convenient cooking, is highly durable, and is maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. Hence, they are seeking a group loan repayable in easy installments. They intend to use the loan to purchase Greenway cook stoves. Your loan will help these women to have better health and save a little more money.    \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1687486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a smokeless cook stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Trichy, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T04:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T04:00:08Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Ponmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Esthernesamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rubyjayakumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Vijaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sammanasumary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Josephinemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Arockiyamary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":9800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T07:09:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":765118,"name":"Omsakthi Shg - Athanur Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mangalampal, 40 years old, is a leader of the OmSakthi Self Help Group, which was formed by the local NGO, People Action for Transformation (PAT), in Tamil Nadu, India.

The stove is manufactured by Greenway Grameen Infra Pvt, Ltd. It costs INR 1,400. It is more efficient than the traditional mud stove. Traditional stoves consume more time and money.

in Ammasathiram, a tiny village in Tanjore, Tamil Nadu. Most of their fellow villagers, including these nine women, work during the day as laborers in nearby industries and farms and some of them have their own livelihood. They make just enough money to return home in the evenings, feed themselves and be able to repeat the same thing all over again the next day. It is harder for the women, who also attend to the myriad domestic chores, such as cleaning and washing and cooking. Apart from the physical exertion, it is the lack of respite from the dust and smoke, at work and at home, that takes a toll and makes them susceptible to health hazards. Lung diseases are extremely common.     \r\n\r\nPAT (Micrograam\u2019s partner) works to address part of the problem. They promote clean, energy-efficient cooking stoves, so that, at least while cooking, the women\u2019s exposure to soot and smoke is minimized. The stoves use dung, agro-waste, etc. as fuel and so, have low CO2 emissions. They are also very cheap to run and help save significant amounts of money. So, Bhuvaneshwari, the featured borrower, and her group have decided to buy these stoves. They are all married and most have young kids. They know it is imperative that they offer their kids as healthy a life as possible, so they can grow up and extricate their families from the poverty spiral they are trapped in. They do not have enough money to buy these stoves outright. They seek to borrow the requisite amount and repay it on time. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1687516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a smokeless cook stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Tanjore, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T04:30:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhuvaneshwari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sathiyapriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chithra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanalakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selvakumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Revathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeyanthi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deeba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajeshwari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-14T18:01:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":765160,"name":"Modesto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Modesto lives in Tumauini, which is located in the province of Isabela.

Self Help Group, which was formed by the local NGO, People Action for Transformation (PAT), in Tamil Nadu, India. She lives in Ammasathiram village, Tanjore District, Tamil Nadu. Saranya lives in her own house with her children and husband. Her husband is a farmer. Saranya has been taking loans from the PAT and she is regular in her repayment of the loan on time.   \r\n\r\nAccording to the 2011 census, 70% of India still cooks on timber, animal dung and crop residues. The largest quality issue being that rural India still cooks on the mud stove, which is both inefficient and poses considerable health hazards due to the smoke and soot released, so Saranya wants to buy a smokeless stove for her family. The stove is manufactured by Greenway Grameen Infra Pvt, Ltd. It costs INR 1,400. It is more efficient than the traditional mud stove. Traditional stoves consume more time and money. Burning of biomass fuels causes almost 500,000 deaths every year in India alone. (Source: WHO 2009). Smokeless stoves prevent sickness and deaths from the indoor air pollution due to cooking activities.  \r\n\r\nSaranya and the other members of the group are requesting a loan to buy a smokeless stove and have a healthier life.       \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1687529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a smokeless stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Tanjore, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T04:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T04:40:05Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saranya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Latha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shanthi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suryakala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Renukadevi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thamilselvi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kalaimathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vembu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rasathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kavitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-18T04:21:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":765153,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith is 44 years old, married and together with her spouse, they have been blessed with four children.

The smoke not only causes health problems among the family members, but also pollutes their surroundings. Renuka is the featured borrower. \r\n\r\nThis five-member group is seeking a loan to purchase five Greenway cooking stoves. The benefits of the Greenway stoves are fuel savings, using all solid fuels, minimized emissions of harmful carbon components, fast and convenient cooking, and high durability, being maintenance free, and being smokeless. They intend to repay the loan amount in easy installments. This loan product will help them in preventing diseases, saving on firewood expenses, and promoting a clean environment.    \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1687546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a smokeless cook stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Tanjore, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T05:20:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Renuka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suseela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Krishnamoorthy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kangadevi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anandhavalli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-09T10:41:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":765052,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn is 54 years old and married with eight children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

Meet Angela, a 45-year-old caring, loving, and adorable mother of seven children. She resides in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. Due to lack of funds, Angela never got an opportunity to further her education so that she could get a white-collar job, but that did not kill her dream of succeeding in life. She  has been farming for the last 24 years on a small piece of land. Angela enjoys working on her farm so much and has always been able to put food on the table for her family. Through practicing mixed farming (that is, crop and animal farming) she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Angela enjoys dairy farming a lot and has even nicknamed her cow \u201cFraser.\u201d This means that the cow produces a lot of milk. Angela is seeking a loan of 15,000 KES to purchase farm implements and also increase the poultry on her farm. There has been an increase in egg consumption in her area and the supply has always been low. This is why Angela wants to take advantage of that and make good profits by selling more eggs and poultry products. Angela will also use the farm implements to increase her crop production levels. Products such as fertilizers will be used to improve the production output. It can be said with confidence that if you invest in Angela, you are investing in someone who will want to transform her life and also transform the lives of those in society. In the next year, Angela is projecting that she will have more poultry and be able to meet the demand in her area. Through the profits gathered, Angela can comfortably pay off the loan and invest the other profits in her children's education.

He does his work in the town of \u2018Belen Yayes\u2019. It has a pre-colonial bridge that connects this town to the town of Cuman\u00e1 and is located 17 kilometers from the town of  Puerto P\u00e9rez. The bridge is by the smaller lake, or Wi\u00f1ay Marka, of lake Titicaca, and extends 520 meters long and 4 meters wide, with a stone base and supported by earth. Presumably, it was a part of the expansion of the Tiahuanaco culture. Over its expanse aquatic vegetation can be seen where a variety of native species live, including fish, amphibians and birds. Some of the notable ones are the \"Choca\" or lake duck, the loons (rollandia microptera) and the \"Huallatas\". \r\n\r\nCalixto has dark skin, short black hair, and medium height. His native tongue is Aymara and he uses very little Spanish. His work is producing and selling artisanal cheese. He starts by extracting milk from his own cattle and later homogenizing it. This gives the milk its characteristic white color. He pours it into buckets where he adds lactic ferments and immediately the milk curdles. \r\n\r\nHe dreams of improving his family's quality of life and income.

Meet Beatrice, a very hardworking mother who is 30 years of age. She is a small holder farmer from Kanyekiini, a remote village in the fertile Kerugoya area of Kenya. This charming mother of two has been engaged in mixed farming for the past 2 years. She commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in her village. Her main source of income has been eggs, milk, tea, and a variety of food crops that she plants. Taking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kerugoya. Beatrice has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Beatrice will achieve their dreams and goals. Beatrice believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the

daily-wage laborers to help supplement their household income. These diligent women are unable to save money from their monthly income. A major chunk of their income goes towards buying firewood or kerosene, and a lot of their time is spent cooking over traditional \"chulha\" stoves. These chulhas, apart from being time-consuming, also emit a lot of smoke which plays havoc with their health. This adds to their medical expenses.\r\n \r\nTo tackle these problems, they have approached PAT (MicroGraam\u2019s field partner) to buy Greenway cook stoves. The benefits of the Greenway cook stove are that it leads to fuel savings, minimizes emissions of CO, CO2, supports fast and convenient cooking, is highly durable, and is maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. \r\n\r\nThey are seeking a group loan repayable in easy installments.

The second chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1687620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for a new stock of clothing for selling in the store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Masis","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":762115,"name":"Jose Delfin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose Delfin, tiene la edad  de 58 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado, vive con su hijo y esposa, los cuales son su mayor prioridad.

Gerald\u2019s biggest challenge over the years, however, is watering his plants. The annual rainfall patterns in Kerugoya are not very favorable in certain seasons for crop farmers.

She works with animals, not killing or selling them, but only working with dairy cows.  She has such an admiration and respect for animals that she would prefer that they die of old age rather than be killed for the profit of their meat.\r\n\r\nGladis is the mother of 2 daughters aged 9 and 4.  She works with them teaching them to be passionate about country life and nature, and to love animals.  Thinking of her daughters, Gladis wants to expand her house.

The stove operates on all solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal, and dry dung, and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. Due to all the above reasons, these cook stoves are preferred by the group.\r\n\r\nSuriya and her group are, hence, seeking a loan, repayable in easy installments, to buy the Greenway cook stoves.

Charles has been blessed with two children. He has been farming for a living for eight years. His primary income source is milk. \r\n\r\nCharles is really passionate about farming because he has been able to make significant progress in his personal life as a result. His major challenge is expensive cost of farm inputs. \r\n\r\nCharles is seeking a loan of KES 46,800 to purchase a dairy cow. An additional dairy cow on his farm will boost the milk production volume. It will also cushion Charles from shortages, in case a cow is treated or falls ill and cannot be milked. \r\n\r\nYour loan investment in this business will help Charles to make enough income to comfortably afford the high cost of transportation that is currently eating into his profit margins. Charles is not the only one who will benefit from this investment - his children will also enjoy plenty of milk!\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1687761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyenya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":46800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2841.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3421.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3561.95},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3629.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3737.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3933.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3965.68},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4104.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4344.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4460.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4593.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":765323,"name":"Leyli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leyli is an experienced farmer from the village of Meghrashen in the Shirak region.
