The stories of artists being cheated out of their money by record labels are disheartening and true, she says. Ntune Entertainment intends to change that. \n \nProudly based in Philadelphia, Ntune seeks to support artists and the \u201cPhilly\u201d music scene, which suffers from a lack of independent labels. With the help of her fianc\u00e9, Natalie has been able to collaborate with artists, radio stations and producers in a variety of projects.  \n \nThis loan she has applied for will go towards purchasing computers, software, speakers, printers and other office supplies. It will also allow Ntune to hire a Public Relations specialist, to help spread the word, and the music.

He hopes that his new business will help dispel some of the hesitations and barriers that prevent Latino families from giving their loved ones the care they need.\r\n\r\nHis Kiva loan will go towards

He was building a loyal clientele and was excited about his future.  In fact, he started making plans for expansion \u2013 until the landlord raised his rent by more than $950 a month last year. So Luis shut down his business just before Labor Day. \n\nBut, Luis didn\u2019t give up on his entrepreneurship dream. So two months ago, Luis opened in another location and renamed his business \u201cRock & Roll Burgers.\u201d There, he sells nostalgia, as well as quarter-pound burgers named after one of his favorite rock and roll figures, Elvis. He offers his patrons a basic burger that he calls \u201cThe King,\u201d with fries and a drink for $7.25. For 50 cents more, he offers the \u201cAloha\u201d burger with pineapple, the \u201cAcapulco\u201d burger with avocado, the \u201cBurning Love\u201d burger with jalape\u00f1o, the \u201cGood Luck Charm\u201d burger with mushrooms, or the \u201cHound Dog Burger,\u201d which is an eight-ounce burger with a hot dog. \n\nHe started getting a request for burgers with everything on top, so he added that to the menu. The \u201cRock & Roll\u201d burger and fries combo sells for $8.50 and the burger includes pineapple, avocado, mushrooms, jalape\u00f1o, bacon, and a hot dog. Luis likes to brag that the first customer to order the Rock & Roll burger off his menu was a petite, young woman, who couldn\u2019t have weighed more than 110 pounds. \u201cShe finished it all and said it was terrific,\u201d Luis said. \n\nLuis\u2019s new restaurant is located in a busy shopping center adjacent to a Mexican restaurant, an auto parts store, and other shops, which makes him hopeful that he will have steady clientele once patrons discover the juicy burgers he offers. Having invested all his savings into reopening the restaurant, Luis needed cash to buy food and other inventory. So, he turned to Accion Texas for a loan. \n\nAfter two months of operating, Luis said he is excited about his future again, and is looking forward to making plans for expansion.

She has installed a beauty salon in her home so that she can provide better services to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe works every day for as many hours as she can. Some days she has a lot of work, but on some days she can rest more.

Meet Rosebella, a 51-year-old mother who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Kuserwo, a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. She is happily married and has four children who depend on her for their basic needs. For the past two years, Rosebella has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her primary sources of income are milk selling, egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Although she loves dairy farming,She passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d Rosebella sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and, because of her high-quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound and the demand has been overwhelming.\n\nTo be able to meet the demand, Rosebella is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity and hence satisfy the demand.

He makes a decent living selling milk, eggs, crops and engaging in other personal businesses. \n\nAbraham is seeking a loan to purchase a motorcycle. However, this is far from any luxury purposes. The illegal ferrying of passengers on bicycles past Kenya-Uganda borders paved way for the rise of motorcycles as means of public transportation in Kenya.

In deep rural places, they have displaced the use of motor cars, taxis, vans and buses. \n\nTo Abraham, a motorcycle will various advantages. It will save him transportation hassles and costs. Many rural farmers are exploited by brokers because they do not have a proper transportation system to sell their goods at distant markets for a higher price.

She has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that she names each of them. \n\nShe has aspirations of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Edna is kindly requesting KES 68,275 to purchase a high yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, she will have more quantity for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, she will be able to service her loan on time. \n\nWith increased income from the loan, Edna plans to spend money to settle the high farming cost of production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high cost of inputs. However, with increased income, Edna will not take such measures.

Her children range in age from 2 to 14 years old. Like many smallholder farmers in Kenya, she owns a tiny inherited plot of land to live off of, just under half an acre, and has always struggled to support her family. Her primary source of income has been crops and some small personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Margaret passionately loves dairy goat farming but one challenge she has been facing is a lack of funds to buy a goat. She is kindly seeking a loan to buy a superior breed goat. From the loan, she will get a steady source of nutritious milk that she will use for home consumption and the extra milk she will sell to the neighbors. Feeding the goat will never be a challenge for Margaret because she has planted forage on her farm and will be supplementing this by cutting plants at the river bank for fodder. This will assure her of increased milk production. A goat produces about two litres every day and with this loan, she will have a steady source of nutritious milk, and use the money she used to spend on milk for essential food and pocket money for her children who are away at school. This loan is going to impact the life of Margaret positively. Margaret is already thinking ahead and with the loan, she plans to increase her milk production and sell to the local market.  Other than milk from the goat, she will benefit from the manure, which will improve her farm fertility and result in high productivity.

Meet Zeddy, a mother of three from the Litein area of Kenya who was tired of working in an office setup and opted to give farming a try. Taking advantage of the lessons given by Juhudi Kilimo, which is an institution that provides technical and financial support, Zeddy left formal employment to start her own farming business as her retirement plan. For the past two years she has actively been involved in mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, tea, and a variety of crops she plants. She is a small-scale farmer but she wants to improve her living conditions through large-scale farming. Zeddy is requesting a 60,000 KES loan to purchase a cow. The cow will enable her to produce milk to sell at the local market and also to neighbors. Zeddy will also use the manure from the cow to improve the soil to plant vegetables. Her loan will let her comfortably take good care of her family and reduce her need to beg anyone for assistance. Zeddy\u2019s projections are that, by the end of the year, she will be able to buy two cows and also increase her vegetable production and milk-selling

Hailing from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, it isn't surprising that his career was destined to be elsewhere.\r\n\r\nToday, 27-year-old Edwin has no regrets. He was persuaded by his father to stay in the village and start farming because there was a drop in crop yield, and there was no one to look after their farm. For the past year, he has actively been involved in mixed farming, and his primary source of income has been crops and milk. He also engages in personal business to make ends meet. He sells crops to his neighbors and to the local market, although his work is not without challenges, he says. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities he is involved in, sheep farming is closest to his heart. The main challenge he faces is lack of funds to increase his flock of sheep. Sheep farming is a profitable business because wool prices have skyrocketed. Edwin is an enterprising person and wants to take full advantage. From the loan he is seeking, he has already identified the breed of sheep he wants, a merino sheep.

In the last few years, Tursunjon has had no work, which is why she decided to start her own business and help her children with household expenses. This is why she has taken a Reach For Success course organized by the Business Women's Association and received a certificate of completion. She has learned many new things. She plans to start a livestock business since she has all the necessary conditions for this business. She is applying for a loan in the amount of 5,000 TJS to buy livestock.

The father of 3 is a smallholder crop farmer in Nyamira, Kenya. In Nyamira, tea is the main cash crop while banana is the main subsistence crop. For the last 30 years, David has been planting tea and banana. His primary income sources are tea and personal businesses.\r\nDavid is seeking a loan to purchase rabbits. These rabbits will be reared for sale. Rabbit farming is being spearheaded in Kenya by some organizations that assure farmers market for their products at an agreed price upfront. \r\nThis investment is a big opportunity for David who has been mainly focussed on tea farming for all these years. The rabbit farm will present him an alternative source of income thus cushioning him from risks associated with tea industry. \r\nDavid has already committed returns that he will make from rabbits.

old, married, and the mother of four children.  Looking for a source of income for her family, she became involved in agriculture and animal husbandry in 2012.  Thanks to her hard labor and painstaking work, she has achieved some measure of success and, each season, she is now making a monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS).  She currently owns one dairy cow with her calf, as well as four hectares of land on which she grows onions, grapes and apricots.  \n\nCholponai has already harvested her onions and sold them at the market.  She is now getting ready for apricot and grape harvest, but she does not have enough money to buy the necessary baskets nor to pay for labor (she needs to hire 15 workers).  For this reason, she has turned to the bank Bai-Tushum & Partners and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to grow and harvest some eco-friendly and delicious fruits which will be sold at the local market where the demand is very high.  She plans to use her earnings from this loan to further develop her small business and also to pay for her children's secondary education.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1684344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Early 2014, Loreta was invited by a friend who is also availing a loan from SEED to join. She applied for a loan which she diligently finished in just 3 months. With the loan, Loreta was able to increase her stocks to include buying of rice, canned goods and bottled water which are demanded by customers from her store. With increased income from the store, Loreta was also able to invest in selling fried chicken. \n\nOn her second loan now, Loreta plans to build shelves as display storage for the rice she is selling. Also, she plans to repair the ceiling of her store which has been damaged owing to leaks during the recent typhoon in July. With these improvements, Loreta sees that the stocks in her store will be secured and in good condition and thereby increasing her sales.\n\nIn the future, Loreta plans to go full time rice vending on top of her store.

and 7. \n\nWhen Angelyn and her husband separated, she decided to venture out into business. With a starting capital of only PhP 300, Angelyn invested in repacking condiments such as pepper and garlic. From her earnings, Angelyn slowly began to set up a store within the premises of her house. The business went well enabling her to sustain her family's needs and specially education expenses of her children.\n\nHowever, in the last quarter of 2013, Angelyn business went almost bankrupt as she faced emergencies owing to the sickness of one of her child. To recover, Angelyn used up the cash gifts her children received for Christmas and invested those to re-establish her store. Around the same period, a neighbor who is also a partner of SEED, invited Angelyn to join.\n\nPassing the process, Angelyn availed a first loan with SEED and was able to add more stocks in her store which boosted her income as well. Conscious that her earnings from the store would not fully cover life-risks and emergencies such as sickness, Angelyn made it a point to save her extra earnings while fulfilling her repayment duties to SEED. She also ensures that the loan she acquires is properly invested on high-selling items in her store. With her current loan, Angelyn would buy additional stocks of canned goods, milk, sugar and biscuits which are most demanded by customers in her community.\n\nIn the future, Angelyn wants to invest in selling ready-to-wear clothes in time for the Holiday season as well as in in selling school supplies. She is determined to increase her income and ensure meeting her family's day-to-day needs while at the same time ensuring preparedness in times of emergencies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1686251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a member of the Wonderful group. A member of the group encouraged other members to come together and discuss issues that may remedy financial problems in their businesses. As part of the solution, the group started doing a ROSCA among themselves and this has since helped them in maintaining high working capital in businesses. They also approached Thrive for business support and development and the group has benefited in that they are now able to interpret business cycles in their operations.\nPatience started buying and selling 10 years ago. By then, she used to sell cream cakes and she could travel a long distance selling them until they are finished.

Meet Susan, a very hard-working mother who is 40 years of age. She is a small holder farmer from Mosoriot, a remote village in the fertile highlands of the Eldoret area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nThis charming mother of four has been engaged in mixed farming for the past two years. She commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in her village. Her main sources of income have been eggs, milk, tea, and a variety of food crops that she plants. \r\n\r\nTaking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Eldoret region. Susan has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, Susan has always wanted to increase her poultry. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women, like Susan, will achieve their dreams and goals. \r\n\r\nSusan believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. \r\n\r\nIn addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings.

","en":"Zarullo is from the Gonchi region. He is an enterprising young man of the age of 29. Currently, Zarullo is a master carpenter, refurbishing houses, and this is a seasonal business. When the cold comes, he is left without orders altogether. \r\n\r\nZarullo has decided to start a business which will give a stable income and not depend on the season.

She will also buy firewood to sell, and buy more chicks, their feed and medicine to increase her poultry farm. The community will benefit from this activity because the trading will be done locally therefore it will reduce the transportation cost to buy and the community can buy at any time of the day.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she will be able to pay the children\u2019s school fee and take good care of the family needs.

Today, this hardworking man sells milk, eggs, tea, and a variety of food crops. He is a passionate farmer with an immense knowledge on farming, and he commands a lot of respect from other farmers in his village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to his heart that everyday he wakes up to milk his cows and that makes him very proud. Although he makes profits through milk selling, he lacks a proper dairy unit and is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. With the loan, he will have a humble time milking his cows and also feeding.

She is 48 years old and married with three children aged 24, 22, and 20 years. Abena has been growing palm plantation and cocoa for the past 25 years. She produces palm oil from the palm fruits that she harvests from her own farm. Abena is also a gari processor which she sells at the local market on market days. \r\n\r\nAbena's main challenge now is to secure a loan to purchase a clean cooking stove (aka an Elsa Stove) that utilizes waste products, such as palm kernel shells (virgin pellets) as fuel. Abena cannot wait to have this cost-saving and affordable clean cooking stove to improve her means of cooking. She is so eager because she can now find a use for her by-product virgin pellet, which will save her from carrying firewood after a hard day'ss work. \r\n\r\nAbena and her group have decided to use clean cooking stoves after a community education program about saving the forest and ways to reduce indoor\/outdoor air pollution. Abena is now applying for 170 GHS to purchase an Elsa Clean Cook stove to protect her family from indoor air pollution and to reduce cutting of the trees from the forest in her village for charcoal and firewood.

\u201cSaquilla\u201d located in the busy and colorful town of Chichicastenango, Guatemala. There are ten women in the Trust Bank and the majority of them speak the Mayan dialect of Kiche. Sebastiana strives to be the perfect mother to her four children. She is a weaver and along with other members of her family, creates beautiful, traditional tubular or wrap skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d.  The cloth for the corte is woven on a floor loom with bands of color interspersed with ikat-patterned threads. As the business is growing little by little, Sebastiana is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase replacement parts for her five-foot looms!  She wants to keep her four employees busy and increase production and income for all involved. \r\n\r\nMany women in the Trust Bank, including Sebastiana, have gained confidence and self-esteem from experiencing increased success in their small businesses. They have also empowered themselves from the knowledge gained during their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares beneficial knowledge with the women in their own language about how to manage their loans effectively (budgeting, marketing, pricing, customer service, accounting) and how to take care of their families (health, hygiene, nutrition). Sebastiana shares that the classes on self-esteem have been very useful and taught her how to value herself more as a woman. Friendship Bridge calls the effective combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank \u201cSaquilla\u201d extends gratitude to each KIVA investor for funding their loans. This is a tremendous help not only for the ladies but also for their families and their community. We look forward to reporting on the group in the very near future.

She married quite young and when she was 16 years old, had the first of her two children who are now five and eight years of age.  She was unable to complete her formal education, and only reached the 6th grade. Her husband works as a bricklayer and the couple works hard to meet the needs of the family.  \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Maria started her food service business and makes traditional Guatemalan dishes like rice or corn tamales and a thick corn drink called \u201catole\u201d. She offers her delicious food for sale not only in the local market of Santa Clara La Laguna, but also in other communities within an hour of the town. Maria is thrilled that the business is going well and wants to inject more capital. For this reason, she is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase rice, corn, tomatoes, sugar and oil, as well as firewood. This will be her very first loan cycle and she is most excited!\r\n\r\nAlong with the seven other members of the Trust Bank, Maria is happy to participate in the monthly meetings of the group where a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares timely and useful information with them. The combination of small loans and education, called \u201cMicrocredit Plus,\u201d is unique to Friendship Bridge and the women gain knowledge, self-esteem and leadership skills. Some of the topics covered include effective business management practices (accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing, pricing), health, hygiene, and nutrition, as well as women\u2019s rights.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are most valuable partners funding loans for Maria and the ladies in the Trust Bank. It is impossible for them to obtain capital from a regular bank. They face a more prosperous and empowered future, armed with knowledge and increased income.

This is a very common vehicle widely used in rural areas of India to carry loads and people. It is an irregular type of job, so there are days where he gets no work and no pay. He puts in a lot of hard labor and time, but the profit is low.  Now he wants to generate more income for his family. He is thinking of buying another cycle van to carry people for additional income. There are very few means of transport in the villages, so the cycle-van is in great demand.\r\n\r\nSo Ajima sought a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) who gives business loans to rural women.  She wants to purchase a cycle-van for her husband. It will help her husband to serve more people in their village and earn more money.  The loan will help Ajima and her husband take a step closer to their goals of improved earnings, a better future for their family and a better education for her children.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband are grateful to the generous lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1687745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a cycle van for her husband.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ajima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-11T17:32:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":765479,"name":"Adama K.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 29-year-old Adama, who is married.

He puts in a lot of hard labor and time, but the profit is low.  Now he wants to generate more income for his family. He is thinking of buying another cycle van for additional income. The cycle-van is in great demand in rural areas, as there are very few means of transport in the villages.\r\n\r\nSo Purnima applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner).  She wants to purchase a cycle-van for her husband. It will help her husband to earn more profit.  The loan will help Purnima and her husband take a step closer to their goals of improved earnings and a better education for her children.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to her generous lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1687748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a cycle van for her husband's business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-17T17:46:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":765543,"name":"Milovale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milovale is 47 years old and married with five children.

She and her group members have decided to buy ELSA clean cook stoves to improve their quality of lives in the kitchen and within their community. For fuel, they have virgin pellets (palm kernel shells) as by-products of the oil processors within their community. Because ELSA clean cook stoves use virgin pellet as fuel, Faustina and her group members will be able to manage the waste within the community during stove use.\r\n\r\nFaustina needs a micro loan of GHS 170 to acquire an ELSA clean cook stove to improve her cooking and save her from long hours spent fetching firewood from the forest which has been hard to find of late due to depletion of the forest. Faustina is grateful to all her micro lenders for their generosity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1685339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To purchase a clean cook stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Gold Coast Camp","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2014-09-09T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-09T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.25,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Comfort","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.54,"local_amount":236.45,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T10:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":259.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595637946},{"amount":13.8,"local_amount":46.89,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624168170},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":141.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636153977},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":141.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649508926},{"amount":39.41,"local_amount":141.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.25,"payment_id":664990588},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":141.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":155.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681285460}],"funded_date":"2014-09-11T14:13:20Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T12:41:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":765497,"name":"Cook And Live Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria is 59 years old and has been a cocoa and cassava farmer for the past 20 years.

is 48-year-old Sarata, and she is married. In 2002, Sarata established her cotton, gara lappa (wraparound skirt), and bamako dress business. She began her business because she wanted to take care of her family. Her business is located in the city center and her main customers are adults. Working six days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about 2,000,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nSarata would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL.

He is a hard-working and enterprising young man. He is 22 years old, married, and has a three-year-old son. Since the family\u2019s finances did not provide him with the adequate conditions to pursue higher education, he looked for an alternative to provide financial support to his family and found that becoming a mechanic was the best solution. He started out in the business working with his brother. Little by little he started to save to purchase tools and, in this way, be able to become independent and have his own auto repair shop.\r\n\r\nHolman is requesting a loan to increase his working capital. He needs to purchase tools such as wrenches, nuts, screwdrivers, floor jacks, toolboxes and tool cabinets, jack stands, and motor oil, among others.

All the members of this group are involved in different livelihood activities like animal raising, vegetable selling, milk selling etc. \r\n\r\nPakama, a 45-year-old married mother with one child, has been working as a vendor selling fish and other foods such as items made of milk. She started her business with a small amount of capital and would now like to increase her sales volume in order to increase her profit and raise her child well. She, along with her group, has requested this loan and she will use her portion to purchase more fish and other food (milk). Pakama hopes to expand her business to live comfortably with her family. She, along with her group members, are very excited and grateful to Kiva and its lenders across the world for this kind help and support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1687755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more fish and milk for her food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Jeypore, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pakama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tanuja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hasina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandhyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tulasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":762275,"name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta 6\u00ba grado, est\u00e1 casada y su esposo es alba\u00f1il, tienen 4 hijos los mayores trabajan en los mercados y los menores estudian 5\u00b0grado y k\u00ednder, con su esposo son los encargados de mantener a la familia.  \n\nDesde hace 12 a\u00f1os, Mar\u00eda se dedica a la venta de frutas y verduras en un local en el mercado, anteriormente a esto trabajaba en sastrer\u00eda en su casa, ella viaja todos los d\u00edas y se va en bus, su horario es de 6:00 am a 5:00 pm.\n\nMar\u00eda necesita mucho de este cr\u00e9dito para comprar un veh\u00edculo ya que su hijo cuenta con una parte del dinero y necesita complementar el monto; necesita del veh\u00edculo con el fin de traer mercader\u00eda desde otra ciudad, as\u00ed ya no tendr\u00e1 que hacerlo en bus y no correr\u00e1 el riesgo de que le roben sus productos. \n\nSus sue\u00f1os son seguir trabajando para mantener a su familia, que sus hijos sigan estudiando y en un futuro tener un local propio en el mercado ya que por el momento es alquilado.\n","en":"43-year-old Mar\u00eda studied up until the sixth grade.

Juan hopes to continue having this financial support in order to continue growing along with MiCr\u00e9dito."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1683326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to plant sorghum and feed his cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Manuel \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624461772}],"funded_date":"2014-10-10T00:01:28Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:35:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":762279,"name":"Jes\u00fas Arsenio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas de 38 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta cuarto grado en la escuela de su comunidad, no pudo seguir estudiando por la forma de pensar de sus padres y porque deb\u00eda trabajar para llevar ingresos al hogar, ahora est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado su pareja  se dedica a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos, tiene tres hijos que van a la escuela y son los \u00fanicos que dependen de Jes\u00fas.\n\nJes\u00fas es empleado, trabaja como vigilante en una tienda, a los 16 a\u00f1os entr\u00f3 al cuartel donde se form\u00f3 como militar, a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde se retir\u00f3 y decidi\u00f3 trabajar como civil, adquiriendo as\u00ed su empleo de seguridad, actividad que realiza desde hace dos a\u00f1os y medio, antes de ser empleado se dedicaba a la agricultura.

She is single, has no children, and has a business producing and selling artisan cheese. She is enterprising, a good listener, supportive, strong, determined, proud, cheerful, optimistic, happy, spontaneous, responsible, committed to her work, and very hard-working with a good attitude. She does her work in the \u2018Huayrocondo\u2019 community in the province of Los Andes, in the province of La Paz. It is 55 kilometers away from the city of La Paz by the Pucarani Batallas highway. The herd\u2019s diet severely limits milk production, since in this area there are generally three sources of food available: the native pastures, including the so-called \u201cllachales\u201d or aquatic vegetation areas; the introduced crops, such as oats, barley, and white clover; and lastly the stubble from harvesting the crops, such as quinoa, potatoes, broad beans, and ca\u00f1ahua [similar to quinoa]. These stubble fields or crop residue constitute a cheap food supplement for the animals, providing the nutrients they need for their various physiological functions of production and reproduction.\r\n\r\nAdelayda has a tanned complexion and long, black, braided hair, and she dresses traditionally (poncho and full, gathered skirt). Her mother tongue is Aymara and she uses Spanish according to the needs of her business. Her business is producing artisan cheese. Her farm has four head of cattle; two are improved breeds of cows and two are of Criollo breed. She gets six to eight litres of milk a day from a cow from an improved breed, and two to four litres of milk a day from a cow from the Criollo breed. By having more improved-breed cows, her milk production increases, which means she can sell more milk or use a greater percentage for her own consumption than for producing dairy products (making cheeses and home-made yoghurt).\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Adelayda is requesting a loan for purchasing improved-breed dairy cows in order to improve her milk production.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":713.54,"image":{"id":1683079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese

He is the father of a 12-year-old son, who is the driving force that motivates him to continue forward and feel proud of himself. Jared entered the world of business when he worked in the computer maintenance shop of a friend when he was in school. Then, after having finished his studies with success, and with the money he had saved, he decided to open his own business of selling office products. Jared feels very grateful to Kiva and MiCredito, since he has managed to get ahead with his business and stock it with products.

Because she had good results, her husband gave his full support for her business. This effort has proven to fulfill her family's needs.\r\n\r\nNow, Jero Pudak and the other member of Dewi Fortuna group decided to take a new loan to continue the business. The group's main goal is to save enough capital to stop taking loans and continue the business with their own capital. \r\n\r\nThe needs of today's life are very expensive. They force everyone to work hard to make ends meet. Jero Pudak can not just rely on the income of her husband; she also has to work. Raising pigs is not the only solution. Now she also uses her loan to support her husband by purchasing various kinds of seed and fertilizer for their garden.\r\n\r\nShe got a loan to buy feed for the sow and use the rest for her garden. Her husband helps her to raise the pigs. They feed and clean the cage every day. Since they are paying attention to the cage and food hygiene, Jero Pudak hopes her pigs will be healthy and thrive.

His earnings were a big help for the education of his children and in their personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nHe would like to apply for a new 25,000 PHP loan for him to buy pails, brushes, plates, hangers, and other household products needed in his business. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. His profits from business will definitely help him to sustain his daily needs and educational expenses of his children. He looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in his heart.\r\n\r\nRaymund dreams of having another rolling store so that he could give the best education for his children.

Firstly, a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and supper, and secondly a beauty salon where she provides nice hairstyles and many more salon services and beauty products to her customers. Khadija needs to renovate her beauty salon so that it looks classic and attractive, and so that it is easier to charge higher prices. This is an idea\/comment that she has received from many of her customers. She works from 8am to 10pm daily and is able to make a good profit each month.\r\n\r\nKhadija has a long-term relationship with Tujijenge and this is her fourth credit request. The credit will be apportioned among the 7 members of the Antokia Group. With her previous loans, since repaid, Khadija started her beauty salon business and has managed to maintain her restaurant with the required cooking ingredients. She is very proud of Kiva's support and her life now looks very different to before. She has grown her businesses and been able to afford to pay school fees easily for her kids. All of this because of Kiva's loans! They really change people's lives, and she is so thankful to everyone who has supported the lives of all these members. \r\n\r\nKhadija is now requesting her fourth loan which she will use to renovate her beauty salon by putting up tiles, buying new chairs and painting it in a 'beauty' color. \r\n\r\nThe group members will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

Their most important occupations are farming, raising live-stock, and tending small fruit orchards; these products are for their own consumption, and what little remains is sold in the city of Cuenca.\r\n\r\nThe members work with a smile upon their lips every day; and they see each new day as the best opportunity to make their lives better and give their children a better future. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Laura is a member of this group. She is 57 years old, and she is married. She has three children who are grown-up  and married, and living independently. Her husband works as a bricklayer, and they live in their own house. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Laura has had a store for 8 years. She works in it from Sunday to Sunday, with no fixed schedule, as it is in her house. She raises chickens and pigs, and she also farms for her household consumption. \r\n\r\nShe will invest the money from her loan in the purchase of supplies for the store and in feed for her animals. Her goal is to make her store bigger. \r\n\r\nThe small photo is of two members who could not be present when the group photo was taken.

Today, this humble mother of six children sells milk, eggs, tea, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy barn, and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy barn. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy barn provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \r\n\r\nJoyce believes that through this loan, her living conditions will permanently change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy barn.

She is a good person who normally takes care with her business. She desires to grow her business more and live better. With her previous loans, all of which were paid back successfully, she used them to buy chicks and chicken feed, shop items, and bought water, which she sells at wholesale price. Regina's business is now good, and she grows her monthly income. She used the business income to cover part of the school fees and home food expenses.\r\n \r\nRegina will use her new credit request to buy a stock of cooking oil for her shop to sell. She will share this loan with her loan group, \"TEMBONI\", which totals four members who will hold each other accountable to pay back the loan.
