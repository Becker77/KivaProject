Small as it was, members explained that the loan had positive impact on their work and living standards. Rose for example, used her previous loan to buy 2 exotic piglets and feeds for them. Her pigs have grown and one has produced 6 piglets; she plans to sell three of these and 3 keep so as to expand her project. Her other group members are also doing well, and are excited about their loans. Teopista, also a group member, had her pig produce 8 piglets and she sold 6 of these to pay school fees for her children. She plans to sell one adult pig to purchase herself solar power.\n\nGroup members are now requesting for a new loan to invest in crop growing so as to be able to have enough food to feed their families and pigs. They plan to use this new loan to buy good quality seeds, fertisers and will be paying laborers to cultivate their land.

40 years old, lives with her husband and four children in General Mariano Alvarez for 20 years now. Originating from Bicol, Vilma and her husband decided to migrate their family after her husband got employed in Cavite. \n\nTo help her husband earn income, Vilma decided to sell dried fish. Dried fish production is a common industry in Vilma's community and it was easy for her to get consigned products from dried fish producers in the area. Eventually, Vilma saw that income potentials would be greater if she can produce dried fish herself. Befriending her suppliers, Vilma learned the dried fish production process. \n\nVilma and her family would begin work in the wee hours of the morning by buying fresh fish in a nearby fish port. The fish would later be cleaned and soaked in a salt and water solution. Afterwhich, the fish would then be laid on drying screens and regularly sprinkled with rock salt until all moisture from the fish has been dried. Later in the afternoon, the dried fish will be repacked in plastic containers for retail selling. \n\nAs fish price invariably changes, and owing to the increased demand, Vilma had to resort to borrowing from usurious lenders who charge up 20% from the loan principal amount borrowed. In February 2014, Vilma was invited by a neighbor to attend an Orientation Seminar in SEED and eventually was granted a first loan. She used the loan amount to buy more fish and was able to increase her income. With the earnings, Vilma was able to increase her production that she already employs 5 neighbors who helps prepare the dried fish and sell those afterwards. She is also able to expand her production area.\n\nHer family has also improved their living conditions. House repairs were done, specifically having the floor of her house tiled. More importantly, her children are able to attend to school regularly now. Also, Vilma is able to settle loans and veer away from borrowing to usurious lenders. \n\nOn her 5th loan now, Vilma wants to buy additional volume of fish and construct extra drying screens for her dried fish business. She wanted to supply more neighbors in her area, and hence increasing not only her income but providing income generation also to her community.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1689201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional volume of fish and construct extra drying screens for her dried fish business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T18:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T18:10:15Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.71,"local_amount":3375,"processed_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3497.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650222},{"amount":26.57,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650223},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650224},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650225},{"amount":132.8,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5829.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561784625},{"amount":132.8,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5829.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579741982}],"funded_date":"2014-09-10T19:23:45Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T15:01:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":763601,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is David.

In this area nobody has potable water from their tap. Many people use well water which is often very dirty. To get safe drinking water people have to buy water which is very expensive. That is why Titin started to sell Nazava Water Filters and so far with great success. She paid her first and second KIVA loan back on time and also made same prepaid orders in between. \n\u201cI hope that using this loan, I can become the largest agent in the greater Jakarta region\u201d, says Titin\nThe KIVA loan allows Titin to save on shipping costs, enables her to expand more quickly and will therefore provide more people with safe and affordable drinking water.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":1481635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"provide safe drinking water filters to a larger area","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cikarang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Titin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":50000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":50000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":4250,"local_amount":50000000,"processed_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50171250.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610613487}],"funded_date":"2014-09-11T14:53:52Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:31:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":758423,"name":"Al-Aziz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Al-Aziz has been Nazava\u2019s reseller in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia since 2011. He has sold hundreds of water filters and also established a network of resellers in several cities in Indonesia. Bogor is a large city just north of Indonesia\u2019s Capital Jakarta. Bogor has all the problems third world cities have: including a lack of access to safe and affordable drinking. \nMr Al-Aziz is becoming more and more visible in his city and he is selling to schools, mosques and Islamic education centres. Mr Al-Aziz: \u201cUsing the previous KIVA loans I was able to get new clients and increase my visibility\u201c. He is now selling through 3 direct sales kiosks that he rents or shares with others. Besides he has a network of 5 sub agents that buy from him. Besides drinking water filters, Al-Aziz also sells Nazava water filters that make very murky and stinky water clear so that it can be used for washing. \u201cEverybody has a different source of water here, so I need large amount of stock in order to be able to satisfy everybody\u201d, says Al-Aziz. \n\nWith help of KIVA credit Mr. Al-Aziz can have a greater stock with a larger variety of filters which means that he can help a larger number of households with their pressing drinking water problems. By supporting Mr. Al-Aziz, not only his business will be strengthened. More families will have access to safe and affordable drinking water and these families will also save money and increase their disposable income. The Reseller Support Team from Nazava will do a couple of joint promotions in the coming months. Besides Al-Aziz will place advertisements in local news papers and will also try to advertise Nazava through the local radio stations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":1677713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Rachel sells the Nazava Water Filters through a network of sub-agents in remote places of Indonesia, like Manado in North Sulawesi and Timor in East Indonesia. Rachel wants to use this loan to expand sales on the island of Timor. As Indonesia has over 900 inhabited islands it can take very long to ship goods from the main island, where Nazava filters are made, to islands in eastern Indonesia. To get the filters quickly, Rachel always preferred to use airfreight, which of course is very expensive. Using the KIVA loan to finance a continuous bigger stock of water filters, she can now choose for much cheaper sea freight. This will help Rachel to save around 5 USD per water filter. \u201cIt is very hard to get clean drinking water in East Indonesia. Many people still boil their water on wood which is time consuming to collect or expensive to buy. Besides, burning on wood emits greenhouse gases and the indoor fires cause many respiratory diseases. Nazava Water Filters make well and rain water safe to drink without the need for boiling,\" she explains. With this loan Rachel will provide a convenient solution to obtain clean drinking water to more than 100 households faster and cheaper than ever before."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1356724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To further develop access to safe and affordable drinking water ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T18:30:07Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":10000000,"processed_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10034250.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595218171}],"funded_date":"2014-09-10T20:19:21Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T14:35:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":765725,"name":"Dany","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dany (pictured) is 18 years old, has been married since 2013, and she is just pregnant.

The animal husbandry business yields a good income, and this is why Djuraboi wants to expand this business by increasing his livestock headcount. He came to Arvand to obtain a loan to buy livestock and achieve his goal. Djuraboi is grateful to Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1687382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T18:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T18:50:07Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djuraboi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1304.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1331.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1397.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1432.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1480.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1553.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":264.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":264.71,"local_amount":1304.35,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-25T10:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695010},{"amount":270.21,"local_amount":1331.48,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1342.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626790},{"amount":283.61,"local_amount":1397.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1409.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209267},{"amount":906.47,"local_amount":4466.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752238}],"funded_date":"2014-09-21T11:29:20Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":765727,"name":"Shamshad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamshad is 36, living with her spouse and five children in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

is 32 years old, married and blessed with five daughters and two sons. Her husband has a bangle-making business. Bangle making is an informal sector in Pakistan. It involves a lengthy procedure. He makes bangles in different designs and colors. Bangles are worn by women, mostly during festive occasions. But the income the business generates is less than the labor that it requires. Also they have a big family and fulfilling all their requirements is not easy. \r\n\r\nIn order to generate more income, Sajida's husband wants to increase the number of bangles he manufactures, for which he needs raw material, but currently he has a shortage of funds. Therefore Sajida has applied for a loan from BRAC Pakistan, a Kiva partner, to help her husband enhance his business. They are hopeful that this loan will have a positive impact on their income and they will be able to provide better living conditions for their family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1686514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded

Nyamira, Kenya. Francis has a family of five children (three girls and two boys). On his farm, Francis grows tea among other crops and keeps poultry and dairy cows. Francis is also involved in offering transportation services to other farmers from his village. For the last 20 years, farming has been the main source of income for Francis. He loves farming very much, particularly dairy farming. He dreams of being a quality farmer. However, his biggest challenge is unavailability of capital.\r\n\r\nFrancis is seeking a loan to construct a grazing unit. A grazing unit helps small-acreage landowners like Francis become better grazing managers. Because grazing is an ongoing process, the unit is an important way for Francis to monitor different grasses, fit legumes into pastures, vegetate pastures, etc. Good grazing management will lead to more milk production and better animal health on Francis' farm. This will translate into a significant rise in income, which will go towards his children\u2019s education. Francis believes that education is the \u201ckey to success\u201d and that by securing the future of his children through education, he will be empowering them and also generations to come."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1688410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a grazing unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":765748,"name":"Samira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samira is a supportive housewife living in Rawalpindi.

married women--Dulari, Sunita, Bunli, Sugni and Anima--who want to provide a better education and future for their children. They also hope to insure their families against mishaps.\r\n\r\nDulari is the featured borrower of the group (the lady who is standing with her hand raised). She is married and has two children. Her husband is working as a para-teacher (teacher\u2019s assistant), her two sons are engaged in a computer shop, and Dulari runs a small shoe shop.  \r\n\r\nThe income that they are generating now is not adequate to maintain the family expenditure, so she wants to improve her monthly income by expanding her shoe shop, for which she is requesting a loan from Kiva.

The businesses represented in this group are small stores, market stalls, a small bakery, and one woman sells clothing.  These are hard working, dedicated women eager to learn how to improve their businesses through the business training that Namaste will provide to them.  They will receive classes in financial literacy and each will have a personal business advisor who will help her write a business plan and offer advice on how to grow her business to meet her goals.\nOne member of this group is Juana (first from left). She is 53 years old and has been chosen as the president of the group due to her organizational skills and her leadership ability.  She is married with four almost grown-up children. Her husband works as a salesman in the community and helps her support the family. Juana was only able to attend primary school through the second grade, but she has managed to become an experienced business woman.  Her dream is to grow her business enough to support her children through the university, so they can obtain good jobs and have a better future. \nJuana has a small stall in the central market of her community.  She sells household products and foods that are used daily like rice, beans, oil, etc. She has been working there for 30 years, which makes her one of the most experienced business women of her community.  She plans to invest her loan money in more products to sell, and also to do some construction to improve her market stall. She currently works 200 hours a month and has a net profit of 4400 Guatemalan Quetzales.  Her goal is to increase her net profit to 6477 Guatemalan Quetzales by the end of the nine-month loan cycle. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1686163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more products to sell, and to do some construction to improve her market stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Aldea Guineales, Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2888.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":5777.78,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5807.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561652800},{"amount":375,"local_amount":2888.89,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2903.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581607299},{"amount":375,"local_amount":2888.89,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2903.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595165314},{"amount":375,"local_amount":2888.89,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2903.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610562065},{"amount":375,"local_amount":2888.89,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2903.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624235308},{"amount":375,"local_amount":2888.89,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2903.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636221222},{"amount":375,"local_amount":2888.89,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2903.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649572936},{"amount":375,"local_amount":2888.88,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2903.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665053585}],"funded_date":"2014-10-10T19:56:41Z","paid_date":"2015-06-25T12:16:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":765509,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribel is 32 years old and lives with her husband and two children in a small house.

At only 13 years old, Nancy led the young generation who picked farming as a chance to make a difference by providing food to feed the world. Now at 19, she keeps dairy cattle, raises poultry and grows tea among other crops. She is also sharpening her entrepreneurial spirit by actively running other agriculture related businesses. \r\n\r\nAgriculture in Kenya suffers from entrenched negative perceptions among the youth. They think it is not glamorous, since in their minds a farmer is someone like their grandparents, doing backbreaking labour in the fields and getting little to show for it. Thus they move from rural areas to urban ones and most of them find themselves living in shanty towns. They are soon faced with problems that do not exist in the countryside: street crime, social inequality and discrimination. They also realize the cost of city life is significantly higher and the opportunities to produce their own food and other basic necessities is greatly reduced.\r\nNancy chooses to take the opportunity of being the generation that ends hunger and alleviates malnutrition and poverty. She is particularly interested in poultry farming!  She aspires to grow this business big time, but she is facing major challenges such as limited funds.

addition to a good reputation in her region.\r\n\r\nToday, she is acquiring a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner Al Majmoua to increase her business merchandise with new stationary supplies for the upcoming school season, which will increase her income and develop her business.\r\n\r\nMouna always hopes to expand her business and increase her profit to provide her beloved children with better social and financial living conditions, as she hopes this loan will help her achieve her dream of expanding her working

mother. She doesn\u2019t stand out in a crowd. She\u2019s not the first one to speak, nor the loudest. She sits down every day in the evening to catch the latest intrigue on her favorite local radio station, which provides maybe the only break in her day. \r\n\r\nDoricah who is a mother of four and based in the Nyamira area of Kenya has been practicing mixed farming for the past 20 years. She sells milk, eggs, tea, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy building, and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy building. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is an institution that provides small holder farmers with a service bundle that includes credit, training and market facilitation, she believes her life will change. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy building provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Doricah believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy building. \r\n\r\nDoricah believes that ending poverty begins with empowering women so that they can control their own destiny."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1688502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a modern dairy building","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T21:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T21:50:14Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doricah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2924.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3044.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3101.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3194.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3362.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3389.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3508.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3713.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3812.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3926.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.26,"local_amount":6926.84,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7292.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680815},{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":2937.79,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3092.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625096},{"amount":38.47,"local_amount":3239.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3410.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194188},{"amount":77.86,"local_amount":6556.56,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6902.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262065},{"amount":84.31,"local_amount":7099.84,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7474.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600351},{"amount":84.28,"local_amount":7395.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7785.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.54,"payment_id":681377207},{"amount":64.22,"local_amount":5844.14,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6152.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.17,"payment_id":711505244}],"funded_date":"2014-09-11T15:12:59Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":765802,"name":"Antonina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonina is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a vegetable vending business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to buy more vegetables to sell in her vegetables stall.\r\n\r\nAntonina has been in this business for 5 years.

As Yurik says, he is close to nature which makes him feel younger, but despite of his efforts the income is very little, both for their living and for the care of his farm.\r\n\r\nHe asks this loan in order to buy a lot of fodder for his farm cattle, since in his barn he already lacks it for his cattle.  The warm months of summer are in past, and the fields are not full of fresh and green grass.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1688569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":" to buy a lot of fodder for his farm cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Gegharkunik region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2014-09-10T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-10T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yurik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10650},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":11700},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11880},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":12120},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12140},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12570},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12700},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12850},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12990},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":13250},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":13410},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13740}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.63},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.78,"local_amount":10711.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-21T10:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10970.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561766060},{"amount":28.34,"local_amount":11638.7,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-18T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11920.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.76,"payment_id":579721808},{"amount":28.21,"local_amount":11972.1,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12261.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.72,"payment_id":595289501},{"amount":28.43,"local_amount":12100.5,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":12392.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.82,"payment_id":611936220},{"amount":28.23,"local_amount":12067.4,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12359.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.94,"payment_id":624363204},{"amount":30.02,"local_amount":12636.4,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":12941.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.57,"payment_id":636721299},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":12633.6,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12938.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.04,"payment_id":649700753},{"amount":156.55,"local_amount":66240,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67841.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.04,"payment_id":665189716}],"funded_date":"2014-09-13T22:03:54Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T14:55:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":765828,"name":"Valentina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentina is 48 years old and she lives in the village of Bazum, which is in the Lori region.

She has requested a loan to start her own activity and generate some income.\r\n \r\nHer application was rejected several times because of her unstable financial condition and lack of business experience.

Meet Alice, who has something that many farm workers in Kenya don't - a small plot of land on which to grow her own maize, fruits and vegetables. Alice lives with her family of six in a two-room mud-thatched house in Kenyenya, a remote village in the Kisii area of Kenya. Alice completed her secondary school education, thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but she never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. \r\n\r\nShe started farming and has been farming for the past twelve years, and through mixed farming she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows 'Otigo' (from a person's name). Although Alice passionately loves farming, she faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank. Alice comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will help her to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also store water for home consumption.\r\n\r\nHarvested water will help Alice irrigate her farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops.

She joined with the other members to request this Al Majmoua loan because they have always been neighbors and friends, and are working hard to develop their businesses and lives. Joumana is 39 years old, married and the mother of two children. Due to the low earnings of her husband, she decided to work as teacher to help meet the needs of her family. As her children grew up, she searched for a new source of income to meet her children's needs and began working with a group of women to tailor beads for special dresses to make them more special and beautiful. Today, Joumana wants to improve her work by buying more beads that will make dresses that attract more customers. That's why she is requesting this loan. We see her on the far right side of the picture. \r\n\r\nWith respect to the other group members, Neamat, the second lady from the left, is a 40-year-old divorced woman with three children who wants to renovate her house to make it a healthier place for her children. Ragheda, second on the right, is a 41-year-old married mother of two who works in a stationary shop and wants to increase her inventory with products for the upcoming school season.

Her business is the production of artisanal cheese. She is entrepreneurial, a good mother, joyful, optimistic, happy, has a good attitude, and is committed, generous, friendly, responsible and very hard working. \r\n\r\nShe works in the Calasaya community, which is an indigenous community. The story goes that the settlers gave it this name because a road went through the area on which travelers and merchants traveled in horse drawn carriages from the Peruvian side on their way to the city of La Paz. Directly adjacent to the road was a tall rock where the travelers always rested. Those that made long trips said in the Aymara language \"KALA SAIKY UKARU SAMARA\u00d1ANI\". translated to Spanish it means \"We rest where the tall rock is.\" Therefore, it was known as QALASAYA in the Aymara language, and in Spanish, Calasaya. It is located south of Lake Titicaca, 57 km north of La Paz.\r\n\r\nRosalia has a dark complexion, long black braided hair, is of medium stature and her clothing is traditional (Peruvian manta and skirt). Her native language is Aymara and she uses Spanish for business in the city. Her business is the production of artisanal cheese. The process she uses is simple but long. Before beginning to make the cheese, using recently ordered milk, she heats the milk to eliminate pathogenic micro-organisms present in the milk. She cuts the curds and separates them from the whey, takes out the cubes, rinses them and puts them in a pan. Salt is important both for the flavor and for the preservation and the formation of the rind. The maturation is the final phase which can last from a few hours up to several months.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her quality of life. She would like to increase her production by buying dairy cows in order to generate better economic returns and give her children a better future. It is for these reasons that Rosalia is requesting a loan to buy dairy cows and to improve her family's quality of life with the benefits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1684016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese

of Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband is a greengrocer by profession, and he has sold fresh vegetables at a shop in a nearby town for many years. He offers seasonal and fresh vegetables to his customers.

She is married and has 5 children with none of them currently in school. For the past 6 years, Jane has been working hard to manage her produce business, which sells produce. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda.

He is very expert in his profession; he is especially famous for bridal dresses. People like his arts and appreciate his efforts. \r\n\r\nHe wants to meet the demand for bridal dresses. That is why he wants to buy stock of threads, fancy cloth, sequins, and pearls of various colors in advance. For this purpose he requires some capital to buy desired inventories, but he does not have sufficient cash on hand. Therefore, Salma made this humble request to BRAC Pakistan for a loan.

The rock was named \u2018grandmother\u2019 because of its enormous size and its antiquity in the place.  The rock especially got the attention of the children in the area.  They went daily to the place where the rock was to play.  The first intent to get rid of this rock was in vain.  The neighbors threw it in the gully, and the next day it appeared in the same place.  A neighbor took charge of spraying it with a mixture and alcohol.  After this ritual, the rock was again thrown down a gully by the Luquichapiy River.  After two days, the enormous rock disappeared.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her parents and her two children in a rented apartment.\r\n\r\nEvelin has a dark complexion and long, black hair.

He makes a living fattening livestock and he currently owns two cows, one young bull and a few sheep.  Homid wants his family to be happy and to have a good life.  He has been involved in animal husbandry for a long time.  Every morning, he and his family milk the cows and then sell their milk at the market where the demand is high.  They derive a good income from this activity.  Homid is also involved in buying and selling cows, a business in which his children naturally help him.  Homid's family is very friendly and the children are well-mannered.  Every two weeks, after fattening his livestock, Homid goes to the cattle market to sell one cow and to buy a young calf.  He now wants to increase his cattle headcount, but he doesn't have enough money to do so.  This is the reason why he has turned to MDO Arvand for financial assistance.  He is hoping to get some support from MDO Arvand and to receive the money needed to keep his small business going.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1680349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-09-11T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-11T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":71.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Homid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":338.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":345.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":372.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":380.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":385.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":406.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":420.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":431.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":453.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":462.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":477.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":526.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":140.28,"local_amount":684.3,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-25T10:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":697.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561695011},{"amount":76.38,"local_amount":372.57,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-22T10:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579626791},{"amount":77.97,"local_amount":380.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":387.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595209268},{"amount":78.96,"local_amount":385.17,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":392.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610752239},{"amount":82.39,"local_amount":406.28,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":413.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.9,"payment_id":624277492},{"amount":78.05,"local_amount":420.05,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":427.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.06,"payment_id":636634907},{"amount":419.2,"local_amount":2351.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2395.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":62.81,"payment_id":649616239}],"funded_date":"2014-10-05T16:40:45Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T14:01:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":765875,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is 47 years old and lives in the town of Mbale in the Mbale region of Uganda.

The previous one was also invested in merchandise, and thanks to it she has been able to maintain her customers by satisfying their tastes. She hopes the new loan is approved as soon as possible so she can improve her earnings.

Since she was a child she has shown an interest in cooking which her father reinforced in his work as a baker. She learned the trade along side of her mother mixed in with a lot of love. <br \/><br \/>Once she learned the techniques of food preparation, she started to work in a pastry and appetizer business. Later she started her own business in this same field adding to her offerings picadas (fried food platters) which she are part of her business today.

","en":"Darika is 58 years old, married and has 4 children, all of whom are grown and live independently. Darika has a secondary-specialized education. She has been working as a librarian for many years and has been involved in animal husbandry to provide an additional source of income. Darika has 1 dairy cow, 1 horse and 1 bull. Her husband helps her with the business. Darika is known as an honest, decent, reliable and a person with strong principles. Today, her business yields a monthly profit of about 20,000 som (KGS). Darika started to use the profit from the animal husbandry business to build a house, but does not have enough money to finish the construction. This is why Darika requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank and will use it to do the roof and wall plaster. This loan will allow her to retain her livestock headcount and increase it in the future. Darika also intends to save money for her son's wedding.

She believes that she is doing well because she puts into practice the values and ethics with which she was always educated.\r\n\r\nPaola is very thankful for the Kiva lenders because with the support they have provided her she will be able to remodel her home. That is, she will set up a new door and renovate the windows. In this way, her family will enjoy greater security and comfort.

Madina has 2 cows and 0.7 hectares of land, where she grows corn for the household consumption and sale. All in all, Madina's income from the business amounts to 15,000-20,000 som (KGS) per month, depending on the harvest and season. Madina was able to start a construction of her house, but does not have enough money to cover the roof. This is why Madina requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy slates, planks and wood to cover the roof. This loan will allow her to retain her livestock headcount, and she will invest the earnings from the business into its future development."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1687869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to cover the roof of her new house in order to improve her family's living conditions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl Mekhnat village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-09-11T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-11T18:20:07Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7954},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7311},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7525},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7744},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7970},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8202},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8442},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8688},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8941},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9202},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9470},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8551}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":766063,"name":"Peninah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peninah is 20 years old and lives in the town of Fortportal in the Fort Portal region of Uganda.
