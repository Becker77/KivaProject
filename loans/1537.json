The profits will support her family and allow her to help disadvantaged children in her community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1688829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase more chicks and chick feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Gokwe South","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":305,"posted_date":"2014-09-11T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-11T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winnie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-25T10:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581586133},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-23T11:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595129642},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-27T10:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611753101},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-27T09:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624818595},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-01T11:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636182762}],"funded_date":"2014-09-12T05:22:34Z","paid_date":"2015-05-01T11:01:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":766072,"name":"Jackline's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackline's group is comprised of three hard working women.

The loan will be used to buy more fresh and other foods for sale, and will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young siblings. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business into wholesale. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Because of the lack of capital, he is asking for a Kiva loan to build a small biogas digester, under the project of NBP (National Biogas Program) in partnering with HKL. After an initial investment in this system, he hopes that he won\u2019t spend much money on fuel and will lessen the smoke from wood or charcoal. He is very happy and thankful, because with this kind of loan product, HKL has offered a special interest rate better than its general loans.

husbandry.Thanks to her hard work she has achieved great success in her business and now earns a monthly income of 8,000 KGS, with assets including three milking cows, 10 sheep and 18 hectares of land on which she grows cereal crops both for her own use and for sale. \r\n\r\nGulzat sells organic milk, which is in high demand among local residents. Since demand is growing, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy an additional milking cow as well as to build a barn for her livestock. She plans to use profits from the loan to further develop her business and to buy a family car.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":945,"image":{"id":1688830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He is the sole earner and responsible to financially support his family.\r\n\r\nThe income generated by her husband's present flock is insufficient to cover all household expenses, so he wants to increase his business of poultry. He has been doing this for the last two years and has become famous for providing good-quality poultry products in his locality within a very short time. \r\n\r\nWith the support of BRAC Pakistan, he has gradually improved his business. Currently, Sakina has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to increase her husband's poultry business. \r\n\r\nThis will help him to increase his sales, which will ultimately help in generating more income.

She has a son who helps his mother. Anarkul has a secondary education. For almost all of her life, she has worked in animal husbandry and farming. At this point in time, her farm has three milk cows, two calves, fifteen sheep and three horses. Also, she has 3.60 hectares of irrigated land where Anarkul grows potatoes, sainfoin, barley, and wheat. Anarkul sells milk and agricultural products to local residents. Her monthly income is about 8,000 KGS, which is too low for her to have a decent life and business. Since all of Anarkul's produce is natural, home-made, and very tasty it is in great demand. Anarkul approached the bank Bai -Tushum for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy bulls to fatten and resell. Anarkul plans to invest profits from the loan into expanding her herd.

She is married and has two children who are currently in school. For the past three years, Susan has been working hard to manage her retail shop in which she sells essential goods such as rice, sugar, beans, and soda. \n\nTo help expand her business, Susan has requested a loan of UGX 900,000 (Ugandan shillings) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more essential goods to sell and a refrigerator and will help Susan to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Susan hopes that, in the future, she will be able to start constructing rental houses. \n\nSusan is a member of BRAC Uganda's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1666840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has four children. Not only is she a good housewife, she also financially supports her family. Given their low family income, it was not possible for them to meet daily expenses and make ends meet. Therefore, Nasreen started a tailoring business. This small business has helped her generate income and meet the family's daily expenses. She has four years' experience in her business. Given the increase in demand for tailoring, she wants to buy additional items to increase her income by sewing more clothes. Therefore, she has requested a loan from BRAC Pakistan, a Kiva partner. Nasreen is hopeful that her business will flourish. She aims to provide better education for her children to provide them with a secure future.

His business is small-scale fishing. He is responsible, patient, dedicated, good-natured, understanding, strong, a fighter and a hard worker. \r\n\r\nHis fishing job is on Lake Titicaca, which has a notable character for subsistence activity (he catches between 6 and 10 kilos per trip, per day). Fish makes up the basic source of food for his family and is often the only source of protein in their diet. He sells his catches through intermediaries in the villages near the lake. The artisanal nature of his business has not allowed him greater develop of his fishing. \r\n\r\nEdwin is dark-skinned, with short, dark hair, and medium height. His native tongue is Aymara, which he combines with Spanish for business. His fishing work is seasonal and by species to avoid extinction and help them grow. Some species, such as brown trout, lake trout and rainbow trout, have been introduced to improve commercial fishing. At first, the fishermen didn't like trout, because the reddish color of its flesh reminded them of some native species when they were spoiled.

Her husband has a woodworking business and is responsible to bring in income for the family. He buys logs of wood from the local market, and then cuts them down with his saw machine, to be used as fuel. He has seven years of experience in this field. He has to work really hard to meet his regular expenses, as he is the sole earner in the family. <br \/><br \/>The saw machine has stopped working, due to constant wear and tear. Therefore, he wants to replace it with a new one. But, due to insufficient income, he is unable to do so. Kishwar has therefore requested a loan, which she will use to help her husband buy a new saw machine for his wood-cutting business.

is a hard-working woman.

For the past two and one-half years, Mercy has been working hard to manage her canteen business, where she sells snacks. <br \/><br \/>To help expand her business, Mercy has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase snacks and soft drinks, and will help her to generate greater profits and provide for the family. Mercy hopes that, in the future, she will be able to expand the business further. <br \/><br \/>Mercy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is a dealer of clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Boardwalk, Natasha, and other direct selling brands. The dealers buy them at lower prices than shown in the catalogue, and then sell them at a higher price to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and friends and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 4,500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will use the loan as additional capital to buy merchandise items and orders like undergarments, T-shirts, bags and beauty products for her customers.   She is positive this will boost her sales and her income.  \r\n\r\nAurelia hopes that her child will be able to graduate from college one day, and have her own business as well.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

This town underwent enormous changes when the Spaniards came and established themselves in this \u201cayllu\u201d [the traditional form of a community in the Andes]. They influenced their traditions and their way of living. The great marshal Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz was born in Huarina. The town, located by the Titicaca Lake, is today popular with tourists.

She wears traditional clothes (a type of shawl and a long skirt called \u201cpollera\u201d) and her mother tongue is Aymara (although she speaks Spanish when selling to tourists). She sells food made with fish. She uses stones and firewood to cook, which give her food a special taste. She prepares \u201cWallake\u201d every day, which is a typical dish from Huarina.

He has the ability to make any type of material (leather, cloth or gauze) into a finished product - what the woman likes to wear to combine with any of her clothes, skirts or blankets, or hat. \r\n\r\nStill-popular styles of shoe are open-toed points and heels, which are still preferred.

For the past two years, Ruth has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells household commodities. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Ruth has requested a loan of 1,000,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more household commodities, and will help Ruth to generate greater profits and educate her children. Ruth hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a clothing business. \r\n\r\nRuth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1689429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She also contributes her income to manage the household. \r\n\r\nShe needs to buy different types of cosmetics, creams, hair brushes, and other accessories for her beauty salon. Due to financial constraints she is not capable of buying these items for her business. Therefore, Nazia has applied for a Kiva loan in a group with other two members. This loan will help her to buy the necessary items for her business so that she can provide better services to her customers. The loan will also help her to earn maximum profit to fulfill the needs of her business and family. For this financial assistance, Nazia is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

For the past three years, Aisha has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, where she rears chickens. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Aisha has requested a loan of 1,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy chicken feed, and will help Aisha to generate greater profits and educate her children. Aisha hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nAisha is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.
