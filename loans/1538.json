El barrio donde se re\u00fanen los miembros es un lugar muy tranquilo, alejado del ruido a excepci\u00f3n de los momentos en que pasa el tren justo frente a la casa de la representante.\n\n\u201cLas Mariposas\u201d se consideran una familia, al t\u00e9rmino de cada ciclo cooperan para realizar un convivio y festejar el cierre y el inicio de una nueva etapa juntos. Adem\u00e1s, agradecen a Dios por otra oportunidad para continuar creciendo.\n\nTras cumplir el sue\u00f1o americano hace ya 15 a\u00f1os y de haber regresado a su pueblo, Abel se ha dedicado al servicio de meseros, renta de manteles, sillas, equipo de sonido y arreglar salones para cualquier evento social. Abel explica que regres\u00f3 de EE.UU. pues ten\u00eda un problema cardiaco \u201cM\u00e9xico lindo y querido si muero lejos de ti que digan que estoy dormido y que me traigan a ti\u201d fueron las palabras de Abel al hacer referencia a la letra de una canci\u00f3n. Quedan recuerdos de su estancia en un lugar lejano y lo importante es que ahora vuelve a estar al lado de las personas que quiere. Actualmente, Abel se hace cargo de su madre quien vive con \u00e9l, algunas veces por su trabajo, debe salir pero es entonces que sus sobrinas y hermanas se quedan en casa para cuidar de su mam\u00e1. \n\nPara Abel es su segundo ciclo en VisionFund M\u00e9xico y est\u00e1 agradecido por la oportunidad que recibe para continuar mejorando su actividad.

After ten cycles the members are still together.  They tell us that they decided on the group name because the butterfly is a beautiful, free animal which is very sure of itself. The neighborhood where they meet is a very peaceful spot, away from any noise.  The only exception is the train that passes just in front of the representative's house.\n\n\"Las Mariposas\" consider themselves a family.  At the end of every cycle they collaborate and organize a get-together to celebrate the end of one cycle and the start of a new one. Besides this, they are grateful to God for the opportunity they have to keep progressing.\n\nAfter fulfilling the American dream 15 years ago and then returning to his home, Abel has devoted his career to supplying waiters, renting out tablecloths, chairs, sound system and arranging rooms for social events. He tells us that he came back from the USA because he had a heart problem. He cites the lyrics of a song to express his feelings towards his land and his desire not to die abroad. He still has fond memories of his stay in the US but the important thing for him was to be back with his loved ones. \n\nAt the moment Abel is looking after his mother who lives with him.  Sometimes he needs to leave her because of work commitments, so his nieces or his sisters step in to look after her. \n\nThis is his second cycle in VisionFund Mexico and he is very grateful for the opportunity that the organization gives him to improve his business. He will invest some money in cloth, chairs, bases, pins, still-life objects and other articles that he needs for his new creations. He always reinvests his profits in a variety of merchandise because he knows that he should always offer new things according to the tastes of his customers. If that wasn't enough, his friendliness and personality is something that always helps him to stand out and is an extra plus in his business. \n\nHis colleagues in the group started when they received their first loans.  Some already had their business set up.  All of them are growing little by little with the help of the loans. \n\nRafaela - Sale of Pigs  \nNoemi - Sells groceries and silver  \nSalvador - sells food at a reasonable price.\nCintia - sells Tupperware.\nAna - sale of soft drinks and snacks \nBernardina - Clothing Sales.  \nMario - sells motorcycle spare parts.\nNancy - sells shoes by catalogue. \n\nIn the image: Abel is wearing a red t-shirt with stripes and he is in the back. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7350,"image":{"id":1683356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy cloth, chairs, bases, pins and still life objects.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tetela,Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-09-12T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-12T20:10:05Z","loan_amount":7350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rafaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salvador ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cintia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ana Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":97000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":7350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9700},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2940,"local_amount":38800,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":38917.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690553},{"amount":1470,"local_amount":19400,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":19458.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561823533},{"amount":1451.23,"local_amount":19400,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":19458.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.77,"payment_id":579807742},{"amount":1470,"local_amount":19400,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":19458.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349841}],"funded_date":"2014-09-12T20:10:50Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":766637,"name":"Chizi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizi operates a grocery vegetables-selling stall.

","en":"Bakhtiniso purchased a house and land in a village of the Jilikul district a year ago and moved there with her family. Now she wants to start an animal husbandry business there because this is the primary type of business in rural areas. Bakhtiniso is a married 43-year-old woman.

She lives with her student son, and her mother-in-law who gets monthly assistance from local government. Vera has her own small business of sewing. In particular, she gets private orders from her villagers and generates insignificant income. She also owns several pigs, which are sold locally after growing. Vera wants somehow to increase her family's living condition and to start another activity. Particularly, she decided to request a loan and go to Turkey, where she will purchase stock of linens and various kinds of personal-use products and then sell them in her community at increased prices. The family belongs to the subsistence poor category, as they have no source of significant income and live in poverty.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the above-mentioned situation, Vera lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require stable income and business experience.  The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Vera to get a loan of 1,500 GEL and start a trading business.  She is a very enthusiastic and hard working person with a great desire to ensure her son with good education for progressing in life.  This credit will be a great support for the family. Vera is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving her a chance to generate more income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":632.95,"image":{"id":1689607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase stock to start a trading business.

My husband taught me so I could help him. I remember watching him work on his own 'til all hours of the night and I really wanted to learn how to craft jewelry. As I saw the jewelry I had been crafting and saw how beautiful it was, I felt happy. I like to work with jade because it is a sacred stone for us Maya people. Jade used to be worn as an amulet, and those who wore the most jade pieces were considered to be the most important people in the community.

He is an honest and hardworking man. He works day and night to make sure that their daily needs are met. He does not have sufficient income to save for other purposes.

He would like to invest in a bulk purchase of wood, so that he can begin to prepare items for the holiday selling season.<br><br>\r\n\r\nJuan Ramon has been selling through NOVICA since 2014. This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I've always enjoyed working with wood, as a kid in school it was my favorite craft. This passion continued when I studied architecture, especially when planning the models. Can you guess which one was my favorite? Yes of course, wood! Why do I tell you all of this? Well, because that's how I came to realize that wood and I have always gotten along really well. I believe it is innate in me.

Given her low family income it was not possible for them to meet the daily expenses and make the ends meet. Therefore, she started sewing clothes. This small business has helped her generate income and helps her meet her daily family expenses. She has four years experience in this business. \r\n\r\nGiven the increase in demand for tailoring, she wants to buy additional items to increase her income through sewing more clothes. Therefore she has requested for a loan from BRAC Pakistan, a Kiva partner.

She is a rural woman who hails from Dhupguri.  She is married and is blessed with one young and lovely daughter. She lives in Baroghoria village in Jalpaiguri district with her husband and daughter. Oyahida has a secondary education whereas her husband is an Arts graduate.\n\nOyahida's husband Mahabul (25 years old) is engaged in farming. He cultivates his ancestral plot of land, where he grows tomatoes, cucumbers, beans and other seasonal vegetables. He has experience in the sector. But these days, it has become difficult to maintain his family with his small income, when the prices of essential goods are increasing by leaps and bounds. So Oyahida and her husband have decided to grow a profitable crop like paddy on their farmland. For this, they need financial support.\n\nShe has applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to start and complete the land cultivation during this rainy season.

She got together with her other group members to take this Al Majmoua loan because they have always been neighbors and friends. They are working hard to develop their businesses and living at the same time.\n\nHayat is a 58-year-old married woman. Twenty years ago, she started a tailoring business from her house to help her husband, who has a limited salary, to cover their needs and expenses. She worked hard throughout these years, and has succeeded in using her professional tailoring skills to provide her customers with the best service and become well known in her region.\n\nDue to the economic downturn in Lebanon, Hayat has not been able to increase her limited income, which is only enough to cover her basic needs.

His income is too scant to bear all the costs of the family. So for an additional income, Aalema runs a milk-selling business. She started the business few years back when her husband's agribusiness did not go well. Now she is the main source of income for the family. She has a cow and she sells milk to her neighbors. The business brings sufficient profits to cover the family's living expenses.

She is 38 years old and currently resides with her husband, Jerry, in Coron, Palawan, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Rosemarie would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 14,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rosemarie hopes to grow and expand her business. She dreams for her children to finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1689871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Coron, Palawan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-09-13T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-13T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemarie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":583.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":766837,"name":"Hen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hen, 44, lives with family members in a rural village of the Kratie province.

She is from Dhupguri, which is in a remote region in Jalpaiguri district. She is married to Ismail, aged 27 years. Nilima and her husband studied until grade ten. Together they are raising their one daughter, who reads in preschool, with love and care.\r\n\r\nNilima's husband is a farmer. Nilima is also a very hardworking woman who pursues the domestic duties in her home and also helps her husband in his agricultural activities. Along with her partner, she grows potatoes, beans, bottle gourds, chilies, etc. They developed this business many years ago, and she learned along with him. \r\n\r\nLike other cultivators, her plans for the future are to expand her property and grow other vegetables, which will allow her to grow with her business and with her family. She wants to cultivate paddy, which is an all-season crop, having much demand in West Bengal.\r\n\r\nSo, she is applying for a financial help from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers, manure, etc. to start cultivation as early as possible.

Unfortunately, their fishing business was ruined when a super typhoon hit their place several months ago, leaving them with a shattered house and a damaged fishing boat. Juditha has just started to rebuild. She is now asking for a loan to be used as an additional payment for purchasing a new fishing boat. Through this, her husband will be able to go back to fishing and augment his catch. They sell their catch in the market.

As a dealer, she buys her customers' orders in cash and then provides them to the customers with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the sales catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers depend upon as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business, Felipa is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan. She will use it to buy additional supplies and merchandise like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener and undergarments. \r\n\r\nFelipa dreams of expanding her business and she also wants to have her own boutique so that she can display her products. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her four children as a primary caregiver. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, tomatoes and also keeping dairy cows. Jenifer has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. \r\n\r\nAfter her husband lost his formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family fell to Jenifer. It has been overwhelming because she now has to shoulder the responsibility of feeding the whole family. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. \r\n\r\nJenifer is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow and to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Jenifer is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. She will also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. \r\n\r\nBy joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.\r\n\r\nJenifer believes that if female farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of the world's hungry could be reduced by half.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1689986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow and build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-13T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-13T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7286.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8772.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":9133.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":9305.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":9582.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":10086.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10168.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10524.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10784.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":11139.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":11437.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":11778.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.44,"local_amount":18539.84,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":18842.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680820},{"amount":108.52,"local_amount":9470.42,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9625.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625102},{"amount":111.43,"local_amount":9725.2,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":9884.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194193},{"amount":225.43,"local_amount":19674.17,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":19995.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262069},{"amount":240.22,"local_amount":20964.94,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":21307.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600355},{"amount":247.11,"local_amount":22458.39,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":22825.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.23,"payment_id":681377211},{"amount":203.36,"local_amount":19167.04,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":19480.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.26,"payment_id":711505247}],"funded_date":"2014-09-14T06:49:43Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":764137,"name":"Natalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Natalia es una mujer de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, casada, madre de 2 hijos de 18 y 15 a\u00f1os y su trabajo es la elaboraci\u00f3n de queso artesanal.\nElla es emprendedora, alegre, fuerte, luchadora, perfeccionista, amable, sociable, de buen humor, responsable y muy trabajadora.

Meet Rebecca. She is a true definition of a strong, spirited, young, dark, Kisii lady from Kenya. At only 32 years old, the single mother of one is a Branch Manager leading the oldest and most established office at Juhudi Kilimo. Passion, respect and integrity are the key values she upholds and that have got her this far. Her achievements have also been catapulted by her impeccable people skills. In the office, she is well-liked and respected.\r\n\r\nRebecca, however, hails from a very humble and traditional background. It is amazing how far she has got herself today. She is from Riabamanyi, a small remote village in the Central Kisii district of Kenya. Most of the people there are smallholder farmers who occupy small plots of land and practice subsistence farming. \r\n\r\nRebecca grew up fighting so many social and personal battles that only few can relate to. For example, Riabamanyi village has a social codification that invariably colludes with patriarchy to oppress women, through cultural identities that advantage men and disadvantage women. Rebecca was really determined to move against this and to thrive in a community where girls are regarded with less value and not given equal opportunities to succeed. \r\nIn her life\u2019s journey, she has dealt with the pain of losing her mother, an elder brother and an elder sister. The two deceased siblings left behind four orphaned children. Being the only employed member in the family, she took the responsibility of looking after these children. Just recently, Rebecca\u2019s world came crumbling down again after her father became paralyzed. She is grateful to God, however, that she still has him as part of her life. She is doing her best to provide him with the best medication she can afford.  With all these burdens on her shoulders, Rebecca still manages to keep herself together and strive for excellence in life.  \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan of KES 438,100 for higher education. A degree in Business Management will help her to increase her business skills: leadership, interpersonal communication, technology and other valuable hard skills in the business environment.\r\n\r\nWhen Rebecca joined Juhudi Kilimo in 2010 as an Office Assistant, she was still a student. She used her monthly stipend to contribute to the tuition fees for a diploma in Business Management. In no time, she was promoted to become a Business Development Officer. She did a superb job as a BDO which led management to entrust her with more responsibilities of leading a Branch. Joining management has exposed her to a set of new challenges that have enabled her to identify some gaps which she seeks to fill through furthering her studies.\r\n\r\nRebecca says; \u201cMy zest is in helping farmers to become more productive and successful. By helping them to improve their enterprise, I am changing their lives. With your loan investment in my education, I promise to use the acquired knowledge and skills to become a better manager and deliver the promise of a better life to our farmers.\u201d

This rickshaw is being driven over local roads and for short distances. Its body is made of polyester which is not strong enough to withstand jerky roads. Now the rickshaw body needs to be replaced because it gets rattled during driving. This is the reason he wants to buy a new body for the moto rickshaw but he does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy a moto rickshaw body.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Shazia has requested a loan so that her

Kenya\u2019s export revenue, and employs approximately 70% of Kenyans. Despite the importance of agriculture to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain underserved by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers. \r\n\r\nMeet Salina, an ever-smiling, hardworking and honest mother who is 52 years of age! She hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. She is the proud mother of 8 lovely school-going children that she loves and treasures, and she will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. Salina\u2019s primary source of income has been through keeping sheep, selling milk, crop farming and poultry farming. Through these ventures, she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for 15 years, and through all these years she has never regretted going into farming. \r\n\r\nSalina sells her vegetables, eggs and milk at the nearby market. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part of farming. She is very thankful that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family and she has always yearned to have more dairy cows. Therefore she is now seeking a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She has already identified the breed of cow that she will buy. The cow will produce between 15-20 liters of milk per day. This breed of cow will be producing milk referred to as \u201cthe ideal drinking milk\u201d because it will not lack an adequate amount of fat and will possess desirable quantities of protein. This cow will certainly boost milk production on her farm, which will translate into more sales and better income for her and her family. Because of this higher milk production, she will save more money to fully repay the loan. \r\n\r\nShe believes that through careful selection and the application of strict standards in keeping her dairy cow, she will have more income and will be able to improve her standard of

He is in his early fifties. He is a doctor by profession, and manages his own medical center (dispensary), providing health services to his community. It's the only heath center around the street, so his patients say that it's helpful. He has had this business for five years now, and operates 24 hours. Revocatus is the only doctor providing all patients with consultation. He has a few nurses and other helpers. He believes his service will be better after some time of owning quality heath equipment. Currently, he is able to realize a good monthly return. \r\n\r\nRevocatus has a longtime relation with Kiva partner, Tujijenge Tanzania. This is his 25th credit cycle, which he needs to purchase medicine and drugs for his health center. These are the most needed daily items and need to be plentiful or available anytime. Revocatus keeps on trying his best to serve patients at a low cost, but having small capital and few quality medical equipment and medical helpers are his biggest challenges. \r\n\r\nRevocactus used the previous credits to buy medicine, drugs, medical equipment and to paint his medical center. He has since repaid them back successfully. He used the business return to pay salaries and cover his family expenses.

Meet Joan. She is a beautiful, diligent Kalenjin farmer who lives in a very remote location called Kapsowar, found in the North Rift region of Kenya. A trip to Kapsowar will offer you views of the Great Rift Valley, escapements that will leave you breathless. A small town along the way called Iten hosts the famous training grounds where tourists come to train along with Kenyan Olympic runners.\r\n\r\nJoan, a mother of one, started farming only two years ago. Her farm is still a start-up. Her primary income source comes from the personal businesses she has ventured into.\r\n\r\nHer two years as a farmer have exposed her to a lifestyle she wants to maintain forever. She loves milking cows! Feeding cows, however, is still a bit of a challenge for her. She named her cow Birbir.\r\n\r\nJoan is seeking a loan to pay for another dairy cow. An additional cow will bring Joan numerous advantages, including keeping Birbir company. She has been able to learn so much in the two years she has been a dairy farmer.

Through the income from farming she has been able to take care of her family and also provide the basic needs for her parents. Caroline is a very enterprising woman, and although she never got formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her family of a decent meal. The Kapsowar area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Caroline feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her.

She is enthusiastic about the task and can earn 35% of the price of the products she sells.

She is requesting a new Php 30,000 loan which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed in her store the more she sells and the more she earns. She is sure that her earnings from her store will help meet her basic needs and pay for her children's schooling. She thanks God and her lenders in advance for any financial help she receives. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Jovita hopes to open another store and give her family a decent life.  She faithfully meets weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from religion.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is thankful that she was granted a 12,000 PHP loan which she used to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Through her earnings she is able to support her family and meet their daily basic needs. \r\n \r\nShe would like now to apply for a PHP16,000 loan  which she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She is positive that the more items displayed at her store will increase her sales and thus increase her earnings. Her income will definitely sustain their everyday expenses and the school needs of her children. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nRosalinda hopes to expand her store in the near future. She dreams to give her children the best education possible and for them to have a bright future.

Sadly, for lack of economic resources, Rama studied until grade five and was unable to pursue further education.\r\n\r\nRama's husband works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing seasonal vegetables. He always has high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. As the family has only seasonal income, Rama decided to start a dairy business. She owns a dairy cow. She sells milk and milk products (cottage cheese, butter and curd) in her neighborhood and earns for the family. As their joint income is also insufficient to cover the basic needs of her family, she likes to improve on her business to strengthen the family economy.\r\n\r\nSo, she has taken a loan from Kiva's partner BJS to purchase one more dairy cow to grow her dairy business. With this new cow, she can start producing more dairy products to sell and satisfy her customers. They also use the milk products for family feeding.

He works hard to come out ahead in vegetable cultivation. He mainly grows potatoes, eggplants, bitter gourd, etc. He has many years of experience working on his farm. His products are in much demand in the markets.  \r\n\r\nSwapna is an energetic and hardworking woman. Though she is a housewife, she helps her husband in his work a lot. Especially at the time of harvesting, she carries the products to the market for sale. The income of her family greatly depends on this agribusiness, so she and her partner want to develop it by growing some other vegetables. Now they have chosen ribbed gourd for cultivation, as it is a vegetable that is widely used in India.\r\n\r\nSo, Swapna is requesting a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to be able to support her for the purchase of agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers. Her dreams are to improve her quality of life and continue strengthening their family assets with the profit from her business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams to construct a concrete-made house for them in the future with the profit from the business.

Her new goal is to improve her working spaces, as her workshop is located in a room of her house, a space too narrow to place her machines in an organized manner.

He makes an income selling milk, offering motorcycle transportation services, and generating income from other side-businesses. \r\n\r\nBenard is seeking a loan to purchase poultry.

Paul is an extra-ordinary farmer. He comes from the South Rift region of Kenya where dairy farming is a booming business. Most, if not all, farmers there have dairy animals. Most farmers keep traditional cattle breeds for subsistence. A number of farmers have graduated into commercial farming by replacing the grotesque, unproductive, traditional breeds with grade cows. However, only just a handful of visionary farmers have taken the big gamble of investing in pedigree breeds.\r\n \r\nPaul, a father of 3, has been doing dairy farming for the last 12 years. He is very passionate about the dairy business. His passion drives him as he strives to push himself up to a mastery level in dairy farming. Throughout the years, he has observed that most farmers do dairy farming either because they were born in families that were doing it, or because everyone is doing it. This mind-set cultivates contentment and the kind of humility that kills any hopes of progress. To people like Paul, constant progress and value addition makes the world go round. He uses every opportunity to learn more and keeps company with the best.\r\n\r\nPaul is seeking a loan of 200,000 KES for paying for a pedigree dairy cow. Venturing down that route is by no means an easy option, though, and it requires investment of both time and money, but Paul is ambitious and not afraid to invest in the future. While other farmers may only have the scope to increase production, Paul can also sell good genetics. This, to him, makes this path worthwhile.\r\n  \r\nWith your loan, Paul is going to make a big difference. Through Juhudi Kilimo, he has been able to attend numerous training programs. He has solid knowledge on: Feeding the Dairy Cow; Improving Herd Fertility; Good Agricultural and Environmental Practice; Improving Herd Health; Record Keeping.\r\nThe money Paul will make from this investment will help him to comfortably afford other farm expenses.  Improving his dairy business will bring untold benefits to his family. Paul\u2019s prioritizes paying for food, then his children\u2019s education, and building up his savings

She is 40-years-old, single and lives with her family in the Chuka area of Kenya. She is blessed with a daughter who is 10-years-old who is her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide her a better future. \r\n\r\nKarimi was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced.  However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Karimi always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much she likes farming she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cKairu\u201d which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nKarimi also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nKarimi is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Karimi believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her child a solid educational background. This loan will be Karimi\u2019s way out of poverty.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1690297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements, high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-14T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-14T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.28,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2924.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3044.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3101.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3194.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3362.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3389.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3508.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3713.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3812.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3926.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":3062.31,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3225.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680826},{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":2857.83,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3010.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625108},{"amount":37.8,"local_amount":3183.15,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3352.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194202},{"amount":76.14,"local_amount":6412.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6753.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823541},{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":3441.29,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3624.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264170},{"amount":41.96,"local_amount":3533.87,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3722.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600363},{"amount":44.07,"local_amount":3711.18,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3909.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458895},{"amount":42.53,"local_amount":3728.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3927.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.75,"payment_id":681377219},{"amount":114.05,"local_amount":10069.46,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10606.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.53,"payment_id":696586998}],"funded_date":"2014-09-18T04:18:39Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":767205,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith is 37 years old, married and, together with her spouse, has been blessed with 3 children. \r\n\r\nJudith sells clothes in Nakuru town and has a clothes selling business which she has been running for 3 years now.

She has two sisters and a daughter. One of her sisters is disabled and gets a pension. For taking care of her family's increased needs, Maia is engaged in agricultural activities. Particularly, she cultivates a plot of agricultural land  where she grows vegetables and also harvests nuts. Maia sells these mentioned products at the local market. In spite of this, her income is really insignificant for a family of four to even cover basic needs. \r\n\r\nThe family belongs to the subsistence poor category as they have no source of significant income and live in poverty. According to the above mentioned situation, Maia lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business as they require stable income and business experience. The startup program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Maia to get a loan of 3,000 GEL and start a trading business. She plans to purchase clothing at wholesale prices and sell it door-to-door at increased prices. \r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the job is hard for Maia, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually. The startup credit will be a great support for the family as their income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva

world! Meet Mary, a very hardworking mother who is 40 years of age. She is a small holder farmer from Magumoni, a remote village in the fertile Chuka area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nThis charming mother of three has been engaged in mixed farming for the past 15 years. She commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in her village. Her main source of income has been eggs, milk, tea, and a variety of food crops that she plants. Taking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Chuka. Mary has a good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nAccessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Mary will achieve their dreams and goals. Mary believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1690323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-14T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-14T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.73,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":607.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":731.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":761.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":775.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":798.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":840.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":847.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":877.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":898.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":928.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":953.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":981.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.39,"local_amount":830.97,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":921.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680827},{"amount":9.9,"local_amount":791.66,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":877.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625109},{"amount":10.93,"local_amount":874.62,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":969.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194204},{"amount":22.11,"local_amount":1768.65,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1960.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823543},{"amount":11.82,"local_amount":945.74,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264172},{"amount":12.14,"local_amount":971.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1076.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600364},{"amount":12.15,"local_amount":971.64,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458896},{"amount":24.73,"local_amount":2074.42,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.2,"payment_id":696587000},{"amount":9.1,"local_amount":771.13,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":855,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.53,"payment_id":731022129}],"funded_date":"2014-09-14T05:02:04Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}}]}
