Ibod has saved some money through selling his harvest, and currently, at the age of 51, he has decided to start a new business of livestock breeding in parallel. Ibod has a cowshed in his yard, and he has also stocked up livestock fodder already. \r\n\r\nFor the loan, Ibod plans to purchase two young bull-calves and start a business of animal sales.

Zamira has two more sons, one studies in the city of Khujand and the other works in Russia. \r\n\r\nZamira currently intends to start her own retail business. She has a sales point at the central market in town. Zamira plans to sell children's clothing, because she thinks this business is the most profitable, as children are growing fast and their wardrobe has to be changed regularly.

is Amie. She is 28 years old and currently resides with her husband, Leovin, in Palawan, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for three years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her child. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their child with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Amie would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 50,000 PHP, she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Amie dreams to become a successful businesswoman. She hopes to give her child a better life than they currently have. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1690641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Rift regions of Kenya. In this area, dairy and tea farming are the main economic activities practised by the constituents. Dickson, a mixed-farmer, practices both. He has been doing this work for 6 good years.  His primary income sources are milk, tea and motorcycle transportation services.\r\n\r\nThe father of 2 stated that milking is the most enjoyable of his activities on the farm. He is very connected with his dairy animals and has assigned a name to each of them. He has dreams of growing his dairy farm by herding more animals and buying more land.\r\n \r\nDickson is seeking a loan of KES 35,000 only to purchase a dairy cow. Business-related expenses keep rising by the day forcing farmers and businessmen alike to reduce costs and\/or increase sales.

One of her sons goes with his father to help him in his business. Her husband owns a blacksmith shop in which he provides services of welding. He also provides door-to-door services to his customers. Due to the increase in the price of iron, he is unable to buy sufficient welding material such as welding rods, soldering rods, etc. to carry on his business.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the demand of his customers and to run his enterprise, he needs some capital to buy welding material.  Balqees has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband so that he would be able to  buy welding rods, soldering rods and iron rods for manufacturing iron

From the past many days his rickshaw has not been working properly because of regular usage. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. Therefore, Sajida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

Her previous loan was a big help for her business, as she was able to purchase products for her direct selling business. The loan was also useful in the education of her children. Her income from the loan assisted with their everyday expenditures at home. She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.<br \/><br \/>She would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan. It will be used to buy additional supplies and merchandise, such as clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics. The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from this business will definitely help her to sustain her children\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.<br \/><br \/>Medie hopes for her business to continue to flourish and she dreams that her children will finish their studies.

With this she will be able to satisfy the demand from her customers.\r\n\r\nShe is always setting new goals for herself and among them is to become a great tradeswoman and have a business that allows her to generate a more stable income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1686666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sweets, fried foods, and periodicals to stock her business and continue to support her family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-09-14T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-14T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Nelly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":74520},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":76601},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":78741},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":80940},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83201},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":85525},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87914},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90369},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":92893},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":95488},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":98155},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100897},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":103715},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":106612},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":109590},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":112651},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":115798},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":119032},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":122357},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125775},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":129288},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":132899},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":136611},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":140428}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Thur","image":null}},{"id":767525,"name":"Maria Josefa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria Josefa is a widow who operates a cafeteria to make a living.

He defies all the traditional agricultural practices that other villagers are hopelessly enthralled with. In Cheborge village, where he hails from, most villagers are subsistence farmers. The few who do commercial farming either keep dairy animals for milk or grow tea for the factories because it is a proven model. They all produce the same type and quality of tea, they all sell it to the same factory, they all get paid the same amount per kg and they all suffer shortcomings that befall their industry. The same spirit of conformity and contentment can be said about dairy farmers in the area.<br \/><br \/>Japhet, the father of one, has been doing farming for five years. His primary income sources are milk, tea and tomatoes. He enjoys gardening! However, his biggest challenge is lack of space for grazing.  <br \/><br \/>Japhet is seeking a loan to construct a cowshed. A cowshed is going to serve him best as far as dairy management is concerned. When he grew tomatoes, he came across many external challenges beyond his control including weather. He decided to construct a greenhouse, which in essence is a microenvironment where almost all factors and conditions are controlled.

He supplement the meager income by doing other business.\r\n\r\nPatrick passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. He is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Profits from milk sales have enabled him to take care of his family, and he wants to have more dairy cows and requests a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. He has already identified the breed of cow that he will buy. The cow will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk daily. This breed of cow will be producing milk referred to as the ideal drinking milk, because it will contain adequate amount of fat and the desirable quantities of protein. This cow will certainly boost milk production in his farm, which will translate to more sales volume and better income for himself and his family. \r\n\r\nBecause of this high milk production potential, he will save more money to fully repay the loan.

For the past two years, Jackline has been working hard to manage her produce business, where she sells beans. <br \/><br \/>To help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more sacks of beans, and will help Jackline to generate greater profits and personal development. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to improve on her business. <br \/><br \/>Jackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Kindly meet Amos, a 53-year-old active and hardworking man. He resides in the Chuka area of Kenya, an area known to experience the best weather patterns. It is also known as the bread basket of Kenya. He is a family man, and he cherishes his wife and 3 kids. \r\n\r\nAmos has been practicing farming for the past 15 years, and he has been able to take care of his family. Throughout the 15 years that he has practiced farming, Amos has been able to gather a lot of experience, and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Amos, being a responsible man who cherishes his family, would want to see his family grow economically and to have an impact in society. He wants to increase his farming business, so that is why he is seeking a loan of 25,000 KES. He will use the loan to buy a dairy cow, which would in return, increase his milk production levels. The cow dung from the cow will be used as fertilizer in his small kitchen garden, where he grows vegetables for sale and home consumption. \r\n\r\nAmos is very comfortable with the repayment period and monthly installments, and his projections are that he will be able to clear the loan even before the due date. Through the loan, Amos would be able to sell milk to his neighbors and also to the nearby villages, hence generating a lot of profits. This would result in better living conditions for his family and society. \r\n\r\nAmos\u2019 target and dream is to open a milk processing plant once he has accumulated more funds."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1690811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-14T19:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-14T19:20:10Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1518.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1827.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1902.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1938.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1996.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2101.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2118.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2192.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2246.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2320.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2453.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.26,"local_amount":3854.69,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4112.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680830},{"amount":23.77,"local_amount":1981.13,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2113.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625112},{"amount":24.41,"local_amount":2034.42,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2170.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194209},{"amount":49.39,"local_amount":4116.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4391.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262082},{"amount":52.22,"local_amount":4351.61,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4642.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600367},{"amount":100.04,"local_amount":8661.93,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":9240.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.91,"payment_id":681377224}],"funded_date":"2014-09-16T02:18:21Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":767582,"name":"Nazia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazia is a 30-year-old married woman with 3 children.

In the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. So, she decided to start a business trading clothing with a loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from their borrowers. Leila\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives rural, poor, people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

He is a thirty-one-year-old smallholder farmer from Tulwet village in the South Rift region of Kenya. Like most farmers in the region, Robert practises mixed farming.  He keeps dairy animals and grows tea among other crops. He has been doing this work for a decade now. \r\n\r\nOver the years, he has come to like farming because it is a sustainable and self-fulfilling investment. Farming doesn\u2019t take all his time, so he is also able to attend to his salary-paying job. A delicate balance of both jobs has enabled him to comfortably raise his three children. \r\n\r\nRobert is seeking a loan to purchase poultry and construct a chicken coop. He is ready to get into commercial production for meat, eggs and, perhaps, feathers. This business is very profitable but it doesn\u2019t require a licence, a big space or product marketing. There is an established market for poultry products in almost all places around the world.\r\n\r\nBesides, chickens will bring many non-monetary benefits to Robert\u2019s farm. Chickens will be great for his farm's compost because their poop is high in nitrogen; in free-range, they will naturally forage by scratching soil looking for bugs, which aerates the soil and breaks up vegetation for decomposition.\r\n\r\nRobert will also use your money to construct a chicken coop in order to make the raising of chickens easier. By putting all the chickens in one place, he can feed them consistently, track each one of them easily and more easily manage and collect eggs and manure. The coop will contain water containers and laying boxes for the health, comfort and safety of the chickens. \r\n\r\nWhen Juhudi Kilimo\u2019s loan officer asked Robert how his family will benefit from the loan, he replied, \u201cthey will benefit from the income I get once I acquire the loan and buy the asset.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":668.12,"image":{"id":1690819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Zephaniah from Kapsowar, a rural town in Kenya with a hot and wet climate. Zephaniah is a mixed farmer with over five years of experience. He makes money selling milk, eggs, and vegetables produced on his farm. He also makes extra income by engaging in other personal businesses. He finds farming, especially dairy farming, to be enjoyable and profitable. The biggest challenge for all farmers in the region is the lack of a good road network. Poor roads make it hard for farmers to transport their produce to the market. Zephaniah is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. Milk prices in Kapsowar are always high and stable. Zephaniah is determined to acquire more cows and produce more milk. He is also breeding his cows with the assistance of an agricultural extension officer to ensure the calves inherit the most desirable traits from pedigree bulls. \"Higher quality cows produce much more milk than regular ones.

The loan will be used to buy more baskets of fish and will help Hope to generate greater profits and provide for her family. Hope hopes that in the future she will be able to buy  a plot of land. <br \/><br \/>Hope is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is 17 years old and lives in the town of Arua hill in the Arua region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past year, Shamila has been working hard to manage her snacks business, selling chapatti and doughnuts. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shamila has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more baking flour, cooking oil, and salt, and will help Shamila to generate greater profits and personal development. Shamila hopes that in the future, she will be able to improve her business and welfare. \r\n\r\nShamila is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1690858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is married to Felizardo, an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker), and they have two children who are now in College. She manages her own household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to meet the family\u2019s daily personal and household needs and for the education of her children. <br \/><br \/>Chona operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, rice, cookies, school supplies, beverages and oil to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by buying  supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. She also has a small eatery where she sells packed meals for added income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>To help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan.  She will use the loan to buy rice, canned goods, beverages, assorted candies and school supplies to expand her product inventory.  She is positive that more items displayed at her store will mean more sales and income for her.  She is also thanking God in advance for your great help.<br \/><br \/>Chona hopes to be able to grow her business and dreams that her two children will earn a college degree for them to have a bright future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Twenty-four years ago, in a search for a source of income for her family, she started working in agriculture and animal husbandry. Thanks to her hard work, she has achieved great success in her business and now earns a monthly income of 250 AZN, with assets including three milking cows, 10 sheep and one hectare of land on which she grows cereal crops both for her own use and for sale. \r\n\r\nZuleyxa sells organic milk, which is in high demand among local residents.

She has been working with her own money. She is currently asking for a 200 000F CFA loan in order to increase her working capital. Fatou has been selling beef at the local market for over 20 years. She works in the morning until 2 p.m. and rests in the afternoon. With this loan, she will buy a cow for slaughter and will resell its meat. \r\nFatou is married and has eight children. The eldest is 35. As far as expenses go, she is in charge of breakfast. Her children take care of other household-related expenses. \r\nGiven her age, Mrs. Fatou is starting to find her activity rather strenuous and would like to diversify it by traveling to Dubai to buy goods she would resell back home. That said, her beef selling business wouldn't stop, as it would be taken over by her

Shamim is 18 years old and lives in the town of Arua hill in the Arua region of Uganda. She is single and has no children. For the past 2 years, Shamim has been working hard to manage her tailoring business, which sews clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shamim has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy materials, and will help Shamim to generate greater profits and improve on her business. Shamim hopes that in the future she will be able to become a well-known tailor. \r\n\r\nShamim is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Unfortunately, her business income isn't enough to cover her family's increasing needs and the necessary business development needs. For this reason, she is acquiring a loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua to buy a special car for transporting business merchandise easily from the market. This will save time and money at the same time and it won't be obligatory to wait for a cash van to pass by her village in order to buy the out-of-stock merchandise she needs.\r\n\r\nAliya is hoping

who is 28 years old, is a married woman living in Kutaisi city, west Georgia. She has a little son and daughter and lives alone with them. In spite of her high education, Nona can't find any stable job and depends on her mother's transfers, who lives abroad and sends some money gradually. However, this income is hardly enough to satisfy her children's basic needs and Nona is very motivated to start her own business activity.\r\n\r\nAll of the financial institutions rejected her loan requests because of her unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Nona applied for credit from MFO Credo.

This is the source of their income. \r\n\r\nSeveral months ago, a super typhoon called Haiyan ravaged the country, leaving thousands of people homeless. Businesses were greatly affected and lots of people were desperate to make a living. Sarah and her husband were not spared by the crisis left by the typhoon. As of now, she and her husband have just started to rebuild again. \r\n\r\nSarah is now asking for a loan to buy new fishing gear like nets, hooks, lead weights, and buckets. With this, they will be able to go back to fishing again and earn an income. Sarah believes that a loan could help them stand again.

To take care of her big family's increased needs, Marine also rents out a house and gets some income from it. However the family still lives in poverty as they have no source of significant income to deal with financial difficulties.\r\n \r\nMarine requested a loan from local financial institutions several times in order to start a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. \r\n\r\nThen Marine requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business, and her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program provides startup credit soft conditions for the country's poor people, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Marine will go to Turkey to purchase a stock of home products and clothing and will then start trading. \r\n\r\nThis new business, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase the family's income and hence the family members will be able to improve their living
