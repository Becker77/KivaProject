Her wish to have a business of her own led her to determine that this type of business would be very profitable because the site where she has her store is located near a school and that guarantees her daily sales because students are her most regular customers.  Yovana tends to her sales all day, every day of the week because only thus can she earn enough to cover not only her household expenses but also the rental of her store.

He says that the extra income from this loan will help take care of his family's basic needs, now and in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the coming years, he would like to continually expand his business and he hopes to acquire additional chickens, keeping both the local breeds and some new exotic types.\r\n<p>\r\nJoseph is optimistic for the future and he has high hopes that Juhudi Kilimo will uplift him from his current position to a more comfortable life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":493219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To expand his poultry project.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-02-22T17:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128976347},{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136702666},{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144736625},{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151920489},{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159660854},{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166875138},{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142110},{"amount":34,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2609.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177436937},{"amount":128,"local_amount":9600,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":9824,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712123}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T22:50:33Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Willard","image":null}},{"id":182865,"name":"Famila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Famila M. sells different kind of dishes.

SPBD's loans are Nora's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nora T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She is 46 years-old. Juanita is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Juanita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as junk food, snacks such as rice cakes, and a variety of beverages including softdrinks and fruit juices in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juanita joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juanita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Juanita is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as junk foods and beverages. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Juanita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":720427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

One of them involves renting out washing machines in the town of San Jacinto, which is in the Department of Bol\u00edvar.

He foresees that his investments will be successful since he will be able to respond to service requests and increase his chances of attracting new customers who need to rent washing machines.  His busiest times are on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and fair days since many customers have no one else who can meet the demand on those days.  While he continues to build his dream, Hernando strives to increase profitability.

She says they plan on getting married. In the early mornings, she prepares means for her children and her husband, and in the afternoons she carries out vegetable sales. First she goes out and purchases all kinds of vegetables from farmers and then she sells them in the markets once or twice per week. She has been doing this for the last 5 years. This time she has a full load of carrots to take to the wholesale market in Tarma. She loves doing this kind of work because she feels very independent and she likes to contribute towards the household expenses.  The difficulties lie in that each time she purchases her products the transport she takes charges her extra for every sack, and this reduces her overall earnings. The reason why she and her husband work so hard, is that they as a family would like to have their own house. They are currently living in her mother's home. With the funds from this loan she will invest in the purchase of products with the goal of having greater earnings.  Until now, the little bit that she invests is the little bit that she earns. And so she needs to invest in greater quantities. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":217890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To increase the purchase of vegetables to farmers, and to resell in the markets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Rinconada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.649444 -73.703056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T19:31:15Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":144.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957504},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227754},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422988},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116214},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011173},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:37Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594776},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989255},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":144.44,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210588},{"amount":47.24,"local_amount":144.48,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":145.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640285}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T18:31:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":75555,"name":"Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joy lives in Agbara, Lagos State, Nigeria, Joy is 28 years old and married with two children.

This is Mariamu M., a 39-year-old woman from Mwanza.

She purchases vitambaa (materials), vitenge, and kanga (printed cotton fabrics, which often have a border along all four sides), and she makes them into clothing, primarily for women. She works at her business 8 hours per day and 6 days per week. By doing so, Mariamu is able to earn approximately $120 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to purchase three sewing machines. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Mariamu thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Musharraf is 47 years old. She is married with two children. Musharraf is a devoted mother that struggles day after day to provide the best for her family. Fifteen years ago, she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances--taking advantage of the space she had available in her house for this business. Her son helps her with the business. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of animals she keeps and for this reason she is requesting a loan of $800 USD. <br>\r\nBe an important part of the growth of Musharraf\u2019s business! \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She also has the company of her husband (Amilcar), 50, in a cozy house in a quiet suburb north of Lima.  Two years ago she discovered that the sale of lingerie for women is very profitable, given that these items are always necessary and many people look to buy good quality undergarments at a low price.  Ever since that time she has been engaged in this business.  Many times she takes orders, but other times she just buys merchandise to her liking and later sells it to friends and neighbors.  Leycith likes to sell lingerie because she can identify with the products, since she is a woman and knows what women need.  She also works preparing food in a popular eatery in her district, since through this activity she can save to pay for household expenses.  In the future she would like to have a lingerie shop in a busy market area located close to her home.  This is her third loan from MFP, and she is committed to be punctual, as always, in her payments.  In addition she gets along well with all of the members of her communal bank because they are friends of hers that she knows well.  Leycith is going to invest the money that she is requesting in merchandise so that she can build up her capital and in this way acquire a stall in the market.\r\n  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":409026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T00:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leycith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843045},{"amount":137.87,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":392.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734621},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959704},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992551},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717337},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":196.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751143},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":192.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933711}],"funded_date":"2009-10-24T13:11:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":149404,"name":"Judy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judy G., 30 years old, grows vegetables and sells different kinds of fruits and vegetables in her village.

His products are milk, which he sells to the tea estate, and tea, which he sells to Kenya Tea Development Authority. Before venturing into farming, he was operating a retail shop in the same area.\r\n\r\nJohn\u2019s major challenges in farming are a water problem, lack of enough dairy feeds, and lack of enough knowledge in regards to animal diseases.\r\n\r\nJohn has requested this Kes 40,000 loan from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This loan will help his family acquire an additional asset and increase their sources of income. The extra income will enable him to meet his family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nIn future, John would like to acquire five high-yielding dairy cows and increase his production of milk from the current twelve liters to fifty liters daily.\r\n\r\nJohn is grateful to Juhudi for the assistance and plans to request more loans in

Melvie is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Melvie from PMPC.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a food vending business. Her husband, Rolando V., who is 58 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living.  They have four children who are 22 to  29 years old. Teofreda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teofreda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, with which she intends to buy additional stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. Teofreda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

Samuel and his wife hope to give their children a good education up to the university level. He describes himself as a hardworking and visionary man.\r\n<p>\r\nSamuel operates a matatu (a minibus) which he uses to provide transport on the Kakamega-Kisumu route. He has been in business for the last three years and has managed to provide employment for two people. He says that while this business is profitable, his major challenge is competition; there are many people offering the same service as his, reducing the amount of profit he can make per day. Additionally, the poor roads in Kakamega become almost impassable during the cold season. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well.\r\n<p>\r\nSamuel is using this loan of 40,000 KES to buy new tires for his matatu so as to enable him to improve his business.

She's married and has 8 children.\r\n\r\nAnita works in her business selling lavalavas (\"bottom-half\" skirt-like wrap-around print cloth worn by both men and women).  She has 3 years of experience in this business. Anita needs a loan of WST 2,000 to invest in expanding the business by purchasing fabric, threads, needles, and an elei printing board (decorative printing method used to embellish fabric).  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Anita joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Anita's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Her services are for cash and credit.\r\n\r\nHer wish to grow is immense.  She works constantly and even in extended hours so that she can manage to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the reason that she turns to a Kiva loan.

Sutarmi semangat untuk berusaha agar bisa membantu dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Sutarmi memelihara 4 ekor babi penggemukan yang dibeli dari saudaranya. Usaha ini sangat cocok untuk Sutarmi karena Sutarmi hanya tamat SD. Babi yang dipelihara sangat gemuk, karena dalam 1 hari Sutarmi memberi makan 3 kali. Juga diberikan makanan tambahan berupa dedaunan dan batang pisang. Setiap pagi, babi peliharaannya dirawat dengan cara kandangnya dibersihkan dan juga babinya dimandikan agar segar dan sehat. Keuntungan yang didapat dalam 6 bulan Rp.1.800.000,- Keuntungan ini digunakan untuk modal lagi agar bisa memelihara lebih banyak dan keuntungan juga lebih banyak diterima. Dengan dana pinjaman yang didapatnya, Sutarmi berencana untuk menambah populasi babi peliharaannya agar keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":144938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Amalia no desiste y con un enorme instinto maternal, saca fuerzas de flaqueza, y se encuentra decidida a levantarse, solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para reinicar su negocio, comprando productos de cosmetolog\u00eda (Tintes, Shampoos, Peines,etc), que le permitan recuperar el buen camino , en el que desde hace ya 25 a\u00f1os lleva firmes de su mano, a sus cinco hijos."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":197988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

At first she did laundry for people she didn't know, and cleaned in well-to-do households.  \r\n\r\nAfter a few years and thanks to some friends, she came up with the idea of going into business.  Since she didn't have a lot of money she decided to sell cleaning products.  She didn't have much capital, so her inventory was small at first.  Little by little and by virtue of her own efforts, she has been able to grow, and achieve her goals.  \r\n\r\nNowadays she has a cleaning products stand, but it's located in the market near her house.

To make a living, Meriam owns and operates a 'sari-sari' ('various kinds') store business in the retail sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Meriam has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Meriam joined Kiva partner, PMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Meriam is now requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP to purchase additional inventory and for use as working capital. This loan will be her sixth from PMPC. Meriam plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

With this 800 sol loan she will buy blocks of yellow dirt and some tools to replace some outdated ones.  Part of the money will be used to pay her laborers who work weekly to fulfill her orders.  Exarita feels strong to continue working and to go forward to insure a tranquil old-age for herself.  She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for contributing to her meeting her goals and dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":436870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy blocks of yellow dirt.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Exarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":216,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727958},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":216,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118351},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":216,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954083},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":216,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987104}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T04:05:44Z","paid_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":161841,"name":"Susanian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susanian K. sells maize flour in the market and is requesting a loan to buy bags of onions and more flour to sell.

She earns her living by making native handicrafts such as bags, wallets, and fruit baskets from pandan leaves. Teresita\u2019s husband Gregorio, age 50, helps run the business. They have six children between the ages of 13 to 25 years old. Two have their own families, two help her in the business, and one is currently attending school.\r\n\r\nTeresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the family's quality of life. With the help of the loans she has received from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by making and selling her native handicrafts. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 4,800 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nTeresita is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 10,000 was used to fund operations of her business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is applying for her tenth loan in the amount of Php 11,000, which she intends to use to support her business. Teresita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. (\"Dungganon\" is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\") Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress away from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their most ambitious dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a community member who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":481919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Topurchase

She has a carpentry shop in her home.  Her usual products are rocking chairs, dining sets, armoires, and generally all kinds of wood items.\r\n\r\nShe started this business 5 years ago; her husband used to run it.  However, he had to move to another country seeking better work opportunities and she had to be in charge of the business and keep it solvent because they had customers that needed their products delivered.\r\n\r\nShe will use these funds to buy raw materials because she has several pending orders for wood double beds and rocking chairs.\r\n\r\nHer usual customers are residents of Managua that come to her to order items.  She sells several items at once so one could say that she is a wholesaler.\r\n\r\nHer dream for the future is to buy new machinery for the shop so that it will always be active and provide the

B. is from the village of Poblacion, Aurora Zamboang Del Sur.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Antonina has been engaged in her business for over 28 years and earns approximately 22,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Antonina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Antonina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Antonina is requesting a new loan of 50000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Antonina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Susana's 6th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Her goal is to help her daughters set up a business and become independent so that they no longer have to depend on their mother.  \r\n\r\nHer business is located in Leon.  It's a small grocery where she sells: snacks, notebooks, pens and cold drinks. She's had the business for 8 years.  She started the business because she needed work.  She's built it from little more than a large stall, growing it over time into the store that it is today.  The purpose of the loan is to buy toys and clothes for the upcoming holiday season.

She is 52 years old and a mother of four children: the first two are married and live separately, the last two are the students. K. is a widow mother and works in the private company since 2000. She is famous for her hard work and her responsibility. With the salary, she hardly manages with the family's expenses, and she is tired of taking the motor taxi but she is good at saving money.

On this plantation, she now faces a small problem because her field contains infertile soil, which has a bad effect on the crop. To solve this problem, Mrs. Srey Tum H. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers, and she would use a portion of the loan to hire laborers to work in the field. For her silk weaving, she would buy more silk and other raw material to weave for her customers.

With these funds she intends to buy large quantities of wool and other materials needed for her knitting and, if possible, a knitting machine.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":409065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-19T19:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":178.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843055},{"amount":125.25,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":356.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734631},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":178.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959714},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":178.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992561},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":176.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717347}],"funded_date":"2009-10-19T22:44:45Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":149437,"name":"Omal\u00e9y\u00e9 E.","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu des accessoires traditionnels pour la cuisine; elle a d\u00e9but\u00e9 cette activit\u00e9 depuis 2006 dans le quartier d\u2019Ago\u00e8 Camp FIR.

She earns her living by operating a business buying and selling dried fish. Her husband Rolando, who is 31 years old, buys & sells livestock to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 9 years old. Maricel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maricel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 28,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for future house improvement & the education for children. Maricel is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in the town of Palcamayo. She is described as being a cheerful and hardworking woman. She lives in her own house with her youngest daughter, Liz, who is 26 and the reason for all her hard work. When she was very young she learned to work in the fields with her parents, who taught her what has to be done to have a good crop. Now she has her own land which she plants and takes care of with much love and patience. She plants peas, spinach and carrots which she sells in the wholesale market of Tarma. What she liks the most about her job is harvesting her crops, since she feels that her hard work is producing. She has spent 40 years doing this activity and she thinks that the hardest thing is protecting her crops from insects that can affect them. With the strenghth that characterizes her, she works alone in her fields, and she learned how to get ahead on her own. She does hire workers to help her with the harvest.

In general, this area of town is devoted to commerce and services, and therefore the majority of bank members fall into this category.  \r\nThe Entrepreneurs Commercial Bank has its roots in the restructuring of God\u2019s Love Commerical Bank.  It was founded on October 3, 2007, and has worked with this field partner through three loan cycles.  Currently the group has ten members.  President Mery Margot A. C., treasurer Cinda G. Bascope, and secretary Pamela Vasquez M. sit on its board of directors.  It should be noted that the group projects solidarity, companionship, and responsibility; those within the association have learnt to save despite encountering setbacks in the last loan cycle. Members do not want to leave the association.  This type of loan in particular motivates the members to work.  The ladies indicate that within their association they find a place that provides relaxation, motivation, and companionship, a setting where they feel heard and can speak of personal problems, a haven from which they can then go forth empowered to once again tackle those problems. \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica Erika A. P.\u2019 main business is the sale of tea.  Due to this business and together with her husband\u2019s assistance, Ver\u00f3nica envisions the possibility of being able to support their two children, both of whom are still in school.  Her sole dream of seeing her children become professionals caused her to join the association to be able to expand her business.\r\n\r\nCinda G. Bascope currently works in food distribution.  In the past she sold food; however, in order to spend more time with her children she opted for becoming a distributor.  She dreams that her children would lack for nothing and works with her husband, an electrician, towards this end. As a mother, she is dedicated to her work and her children.  Cinda lives in the Villa Victoria neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMaria de Carmen C. S. is a person who has a great deal of responsibility.  Throughout the day she commutes between Villa Victoria, where her home is located, and El Alto where she markets bread in El Ceibo, returning once again to her home to sell lubricants.  Despite her comings and goings, she is always within earshot of her children.  Her husband drives a taxi, which puts food on the table and contributes to household maintenance.\r\n\r\nJaneth Cristina N. plays her part at a Punto Cotel, a La Paz telecommunications company that provides Internet, telephone and cable television services.  She dreams of seeing her only son become a professional, but also hopes to be able to buy a house for her family, and to attain this goal works six days a week.  She is a person who is very dedicated to her business and to her family.  Her husband is a tailor, who works out of the home.\r\n\r\nVincente C. M. shoulders a lot of responsibility for his family.  As the head of household, this father occupies a special role in his home since his children look to him as a role model.  He engages in two endeavors to put food on the table and contribute to his children\u2019s education, an expansion service and the neighborhood store.  His wife sells food.

He is married and the father of six children, he practices his trade with determination and professionalism. This confers him a good reputation and orders from everywhere. He has very good relations with large service industries, institutions, businesses that often give him contracts and he cannot meet the demand anymore because of the increase in the price of boards. This is why, he would like to go to farms and villages to buy in bulk and build up a large stock of boards. That would allow him to serve his clients on time and to obtain other large contracts that he can't currently get because he lacks the financial means. Thus, he is requesting a loan to fulfill his dearest wish and to establish himself in his neighborhood. <p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva

On behalf of Malika and everyone here at IMON International, thank you for your support! \r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

But beyond this declaration, for the inhabitants of this city, is the heritage of its culture, its privileged location, its architecture, its archaeological remains and natural beauty that surround this beautiful city of the Ecuadorian highlands. Here we find the communal bank \"El Mirador\" which is comprised of women dreamers who are ready to make their dreams a reality, based on their efforts and sacrifices with their families. \r\n\r\nSilvia T. lives in the city of Cuenca with her 12 year-old daughter.  Her husband traveled outside the country and, in order to become a legal immigrant, divorced from Silvia 7 years ago so that he could marry there. But once legal, he forgot his family.  Now she has a new relationship in which she conceived a daughter, who is now 1 year and 7 months old.  They do not have a house so they live in a rented home.\r\n\r\n Silvia has worked as an accountant at a mechanic's shop for 5 years.  Her part time schedule allows for her to care for her niece in the afternoons while her sister studies.  In addition, she makes and mends clothing in her free time.  As she enjoys a challenge, this year she intends to enroll in a beauty class at a school in her area.  Her partner works in the art of jewelry.\r\n\r\nSilvia is in her 4th loan cycle with the communal bank.  With her first loan she bought a sewing machine.  With the other loans she received she invested in the health of her daughters who, during a period of time, were admitted to a clinic in her area.  Now with this loan she will acquire an industrial sewing machine to expand her small dressmaking workshop.  Her goal is to eventually have a large sewing workshop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":519897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to acquire an industrial sewing machine for her business making and mending clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-06T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Silvia Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674842},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709025},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892323},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632694},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846743},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":64.13,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":64.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113263}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T05:28:11Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":195263,"name":"Janchiv","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janchiv L. is 27, married and has a 2-year-old child.

She is 41 years old. Charlyn is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Charlyn owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Charlyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7500 PHP a month for these activities. She chose to lower down the amount of her loan from PHP 13,000 to PHP 5,000 because she finds it easier to pay back.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Charlyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Charlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Charlyn is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Charlyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Then she takes losses or her capital becomes locked up due to slow stock movement. However she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 50,000 to buy more clothes to boost her business during this festive season.

After finishing high school she was accepted to Kapan's musical academy. Svetlana is a widow and has three children: a son and two daughters. All of her children have their own families and live separately from their mother. Since 1996 Svetlana has been working in retail. She sells clothes, lingerie and shoes at a rented stall at the Kapan City Market. She purchases her inventory every month in Erevan and she works without weekends. Recently Svetlana also started to sell fresh flowers which she purchases every morning from whole-sellers. With the help of her youngest daughter Svetlana can manage both the clothing and the flower sale businesses. Flower sales bring them additional profit and allow Svetlana to financially help out her daughters' families. Svetalana is asking for a loan of 400,000 dram to purchase fall season clothing and shoes before the start of the new school year and to expand her flower business. This is Svetlana's 7th loan and she has always paid back her loans on time.

has been living on his farm his entire life. He not only inherited his lands from his father, but he also inherited the knowledge of how to grow rice from him. He lives in his home with his wife and one of his children. He also has three sons who live separately, but help him work his lands. He will use the loan to fix his lands for farming. He will also buy fertilizer and seeds for his farm. In the future, he wants to invest in pigs and chickens. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samuel is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T04:20:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-30T02:17:54Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:23:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31432},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:19:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40401},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:44:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53268},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:23:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73631},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:32:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88529},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:41:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99025}],"funded_date":"2007-05-16T02:17:54Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14155,"name":"Prom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Prom R. is a 29-year -old widow living in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

He is 29 years old, single, and father of one child who is 7 years old.  He completed 12th grade and is currently enrolled in technical college.  He lives in his own home with his siblings and also supports his daughter who lives with her mother.  \r\n\r\nHe left Chimoio for Maputo, specifically for the Boane district, with his parents when he was 14 years old.  He has his own business selling basic necessities and cell phone minutes.  He earns around 11.000,00 MT from these activities and also earns 4.900,00 MT a subsidy paid by the Rwandan embassy, where he teaches a Portuguese language class form 5pm to 7pm.  With his earnings he is able to save some money in his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans in other banking institutions.  He learned about Hluvuku through his brother who is also a client of the institution.  This is his 4th loan, in the amount of 21.000,00 MT, which he will use to purchase products (biscuits, sugar, soups, batteries, etc.) to serve his customers.  His prior loans were for the same amount and for the same activities.\r\n\r\nIn the future he plans to request additional loans with the goal of growing his business and building a

Her house is a mixture of reeds and wooden boards, and receives electricity as its only basic service.  She is a widow with two adult children.\r\n<p>\r\nAna started selling garlic after her husband died so that she could continue paying her household expenses.  She buys garlic at a low price and then sells it after it has been peeled.  Many people now buy peeled garlic from her.  Ana works from 8am until 6pm.  What she wants most is to have her own vending post where she can sell garlic and grain, but her financial situation has not been favorable.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she wants to buy cement, iron, and blocks so that she can build a cement house that does not leak when it rains.  In the future, she wants to open a store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":497910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase construction materials for building a cement house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-03-06T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":47.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.99},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.24,"local_amount":48.24,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":48.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945772},{"amount":47.99,"local_amount":47.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":47.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674133},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":49.38,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":49.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708294},{"amount":50.47,"local_amount":50.47,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891491},{"amount":51.84,"local_amount":51.84,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":51.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631740},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":52.08,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845626}],"funded_date":"2010-03-06T17:59:43Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":187085,"name":"Faamita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faamita A. C. is 37 and married with 4 children (ages 3 - 12).  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Faamita has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faamita needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase new items to expand product offering.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Faamita joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faamita's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faamita A. C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is Julieta C., 60 years of age, a widow and a resident of Fernan, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental. For her means of living, she engages in a Sari-sari store business. For 20 years she has been able to sustain this business even in times of crisis. At present, she is earning an average net income of not less than PHP1,500.00 a month. This income is so helpful in order to support her basic needs. Aside from that, she is also earning support from her son. \r\n\r\nShe joined the cooperative just this year. As a newly recognized member under the PDP-LP Program, she is applying for an amount of PHP3,000.00 to add to the capital for her existing business. The future income will be used for her basic needs, loan repayments and savings. She is hoping that she can  also help her grandchildren in sending them to schools by means of this business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
