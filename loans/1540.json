Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

Ian is appreciative of UGAFODE and Kiva lender support and he pledges to repay his loan well to maintain the partnership.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1691483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicken feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-09-15T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-15T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":143.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.83,"local_amount":108149,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":108960.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":611970402},{"amount":435.73,"local_amount":1391851,"processed_date":"2015-08-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1402289.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":103.61,"payment_id":696786528},{"amount":154.14,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":503750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":39.61,"payment_id":732673321}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T06:00:58Z","paid_date":"2015-10-23T12:13:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":768099,"name":"Gonzaga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gonzaga is married to Caroline and they have two children together as well as taking care of two orphans.

The folks called it \"pan bisaya\" because it is not oven-cooked bread in the bakery. It is cooked by wood charcoal in a specially-designed cooking pan. A friend of Marilou's approached her to turn her \"pan bisaya\" expertise into a business and Marilou gave a shot to a \"pan bisaya\" business. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marilou applied her membership with Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC). Hearing all the benefits, she never hesitated to become one. She maintains the status of being a member in good-standing and repays her obligations in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nRecently, she asked for financial assistance of PHP 20,000 to buy more sacks of flour and other raw ingredients for her \"pan bisaya\" business . Through this loan, she hopes to increase her income and help in the expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou has found assistance for their financial needs through Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative and she is very thankful, with all her heart.

Syukur's parents live in a village on the island of Nias, North Sumatra, Indonesia. His father works as a laborer on a rubber plantation, and his income is not fixed. The income is inadequate because rubber prices are very low at this time. Sometimes if there were rubber tapping, his father works in the fields of others. His parents want their children to go to school so that they have a happy future. Syukur is the third child of four siblings. Thanks to the encouragement of his parents, Syukur is determined to study at the Academy of Maritime of Nusantara, because of his idea that he would like to work in a large port in Indonesia. Since the economic conditions of the parents are not fixed, Syukur wishs to follow the Student Loan program from Kiva, in order to ease the burden of his parents and also continue his studies. Syukur is very grateful to the lenders from around the world who would help him in his studies, even though he is not able to get to know them personally."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1691974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay his education fees for three years","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"CILACAP","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":253,"posted_date":"2014-09-15T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-15T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Syukur Dermawan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T18:40:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":768369,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is requesting a loan of USD 1,000 to improve her business.

He began by planting beans and corn, next adding to the list rice and other basic grains. \r\n\r\nThis father of 54 years counts on the support of his whole family. His wife, who administrates the business, and his two sons age 8 and 7, who are this tenacious man's motivation. His age isn't an obstacle for continuing to grow as a farmer, which is why he wants to continue investing in his business. For this reason, he asks for a loan to buy fertilizer, seeds and herbicide to be able to have a new crop of high quality and meet his sales goals. This will allow him to save up to buy an artisan well in the future, which he very much needs. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1687060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer, seeds and herbicide.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-09-15T23:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-15T23:10:05Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Lorenzo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":829.5,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":829.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665097026}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T11:20:40Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T14:09:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Thompson","image":1511903}},{"id":768661,"name":"Akou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"a_ - \nAg\u00e9e de 44 ans  Akou est  Mari\u00e9e  et  m\u00e8re d\u2019 4 enfants  r\u00e9sidant  \u00e0 Adidogom\u00e9.

She is married and her husband is a farmer. They have five children ages 10, 12, 14, 17 and 26. The three youngest are under her care and go to school. They are in first, second and sixth grade in elementary school. Her husband is responsible for maintaining the home. All of her life, Ana has been devoted to agriculture and domestic chores. She also washes and irons other people's laundry. She states that she helps her partner and her oldest son cultivate the fields. The land is located 15 minutes from her house, and they travel by foot. She needs a loan in order to buy fertilizers and pesticides to sow 7,000 square meters of corn.

Meet Lucy, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Chuka area of Kenya, near the famous Mount Kenya. \r\n\r\nLucy, 39, has been farming for the past 15 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practising mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nLucy is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nKenya's Chuka area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Lucy could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Lucy, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Lucy believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. \r\n\r\nShe also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Lucy to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going

Danish lives in Karachi. He is 28 and recently got married. They live in a rented house with their parents. He runs a general store in the nearby market. He started this business three years ago. Now it has grown and his customer base has increased.

She is married and has one child who is currently in school. For the past 7 months, Rahab has been working hard to manage her food stall, which sells fresh food. To help expand her business, Rahab has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food for selling, and will help Rahab to generate greater profits and to pay school fees for her child and her younger brothers. Rahab hopes that in the future she will be able to own a vehicle. Rahab is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life skills training.

23, is an agri-business entrepreneur from Kipreres in the South Rift region of Kenya. The bachelor has been actively doing this work for three years. He makes a decent income selling eggs and crops from his farm at the local market. He is also engaged in other personal businesses to make additional income. \r\nPoultry farming has worked out well for Kipkemoi mainly because of the growing demand for chicken products and by-products. He also attributes his success to the passion and vision he has for the business. He spends so much time rearing poultry that most people would probably think he is too involved since he even names the chickens. The biggest risk his business faces is an outbreak of diseases. However, he is very keen on taking all necessary precautions to mitigate this risk. \r\nKipkemoi is seeking a loan of KES 65,000 to purchase more poultry. With your money, he will expand his business by owning more chickens and selling more eggs. \r\nKipkemoi has nurtured a 'saving culture.' He will use the money from this investment to build his savings account and provide his family with a balanced diet.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1692100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bomet","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-16T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-16T04:40:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.05,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kipkemoi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3946.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4751.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4947.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5040.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5190.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5463.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5507.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5700.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5841.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6033.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6195.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6380}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.97,"local_amount":10051.1,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10275.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680835},{"amount":60.25,"local_amount":5221.71,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5338.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194216},{"amount":56.86,"local_amount":4927.74,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5037.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823551},{"amount":59.76,"local_amount":5179.53,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5295.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262086},{"amount":130.1,"local_amount":11275.19,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":11526.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264182},{"amount":63.06,"local_amount":5465.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5587.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458904},{"amount":63.91,"local_amount":5774.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5903.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.72,"payment_id":681377230},{"amount":49.54,"local_amount":4506.95,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4607.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.46,"payment_id":696587011},{"amount":84.4,"local_amount":7909.4,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8085.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.86,"payment_id":711505263},{"amount":51.1,"local_amount":4688.72,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4793.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.01,"payment_id":731022135}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T20:13:56Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":768479,"name":"Neth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neth is a 27-year-old married woman with two children.

She is married to a carpenter and they're blessed with one child. She owns and operates a retail store in their village and has been doing this for almost a year. She earns a net income of PHP 500 daily.

Rift Kenya. On the farm, he grows various crops and keeps dairy cattle and poultry. For the last 6 years, he has made money selling his farm's produce and engaging in other side businesses. He feels passionate about farming. However, his business is facing challenges such as high cost of inputs and occasional drought.\r\n\r\nJulius is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. The upside, to Julius, of focusing more on his poultry business is that it is not very much affected by the major challenges he faces: high cost of farm inputs and drought. Poultry feed on feeds that are readily available. They also lay eggs regardless of the season of the year. This investment is provides a certain source of income all year round. \r\n\r\nThe money Julius will make from this expansion will cater for his family expenses such as food and school fees. He wants his family to enjoy a balanced diet to grow strong and healthy so that they can be more productive towards generating income for the family.
