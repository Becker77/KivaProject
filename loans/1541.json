She has a little daughter who is too young for school. Dipika has a secondary education. She lives with her husband and daughter in their own mud-made house at Bengkandi in Jalpaiguri district. Her husband, Uttam, is a green grocer in the local market. He has no consistent income, so it is hardly possible for him to maintain a family with his income.\r\n\r\nDipika is hardworking and optimistic. She is very motivated to provide her family a beautiful life with good food and clothing. Thus she started up a business selling cow milk to her locality with the support of her husband. She cares for one dairy cow and sells the milk to her locality to assist her husband financially to run the family. She makes enough through her business to contribute to the family income. \r\n\r\nShe needs to improve her business to cover her household expenses. She wants to purchase another dairy cow to start a milk products (curd, butter, cottage cheese, etc.) business. She has earned the good will of her neighbors as she sells good milk.

is fifty-two years old, married and a hardworking mother.

They have been in this business for many years. Since she wants to be more productive, she has now decided to enter into business herself, purchasing fish in bulk for resale at the market. Last September 10, 2008 both Emma and her husband agreed to join Paglaum MPC to receive loans because they wanted to buy fishing nets. But aside from the financial assistance they received, they say that they also enjoyed the add-on benefits like insurance and savings. Emma has now applied for a loan of 10,000 PHP to buy fish for resale. She hopes that with Paglaum\u2019s help and with patience and diligence of her husband, she will be a successful vendor someday, with a stall in the public

She is married and has three children. She first applied for a loan with Arvand when she found out it was possible to receive financial assistance. She and her family live in a rural area. She has a college degree, but since she needs to raise her three children she is a homemaker and does not work in her area of specialization. She is always close by her children and takes care of them. Her husband also has a college degree and is an accountant.\r\n\r\nIn order to help her husband in providing for the family, Davlatoy works from home as a seamstress, taking orders for women's dresses. She earns a good income from these activities. She wants to buy a new sewing machine and sewing materials, so she applied for a loan with Arvand. She hopes for a positive outcome and thanks Arvand in advance for their

Isaac is happily married with 5 children. His two youngest children are still in school. Isaac lives with his family in Abura Koforidua in the Central Region of Ghana. Isaac has been a farmer for 17 years. He grows both coconuts and oranges. He also owns a small provisions shop to supplement his income. However, his main source of income remains his farm. Isaac and his fellow group members belong to local registered farming association that is very dynamic with strong leadership. His association also gets regular capacity building support from GIZ Germany, Ghana Office and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOFA Ghana). The association has obtained a contractual agreement with a local company that buys their crops. Isaac now only needs to focus on maximizing his profit. He plans to re-invest the profit from his farm for future expansion. Isaac finds it costly to maintain his farms since it is very difficult to finance the cost alone. He has to hire laborers for work to weed the farm and harvest the crops. He also has to pay for labourers to transport the oranges to sale centres. Without this help, Isaac crops would remain in the farm and he would lose income. Isaac hopes to make enough profit on his farms so that he can also see his two younger children through high school and tertiary education.

She is 62 years old and married with eight children. Margaret's three elder children are married and on their own and the remaining five are currently attending school. Margaret is a petty trader and palm oil producer. She sells at the local market and to a soap-producing company currently based in Assin Fosu. Margaret's main priority now is to secure a loan to purchase a clean cook stove (a.k.a. Elsa Stove) that uses waste products such as Virgin Pellet (palm kernel shells) as fuel. Palm kernel shells are waste products from her oil processing. Margaret will use this byproduct from her oil processing and will not incur any fuel costs when she adopts the use of the Elsa Stove. As a result, she will save some money for her household. This stove is the product of a research project supported by the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States Science and Technology Programme and the European Union (EU)to eliminate both indoor and outdoor air pollution and to reduce deforestation. The adoption and the use of the stove means the end to cutting down of trees for firewood and charcoal for cooking and heating water in their community.

Felicia has been doing this for the past 15 years. She belongs to Emoa Ku Group. Felicia's main problem is obtaining funds to purchase an Elsa clean cook stove. She spends 5 GHS daily to buy firewood, which is now difficult to get. The Elsa clean-cook stove uses waste products, such as palm Kernel shells, as fuel, which is found everywhere in her community. Palm kernel shells are a by-product of her oil processing.  Felicia will save 5 GHS daily from the purchase of firewood when she adopts the use of the Elsa Stove. Felicia cannot wait to use the stove to reduce indoor air pollution and to save the lives of her children.

In the Philippines it is more economical to buy meals out instead of them cooking at home if the family is composed only of about 2 to 3 persons.  His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\n\nTo help him operate his business, he is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan, which he will use to buy ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. He is positive that the loan will boost his earnings from his food stall.  \n\nRolando dreams of giving his children a good education through all of his hard work. He also hopes to expand his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

As a whole the group needs general financial assistance to pay for farm maintenance, harvesting and transporting the crops to a point of sale. \r\n<p>\r\nWith Edward as its leader, Grace to Grace Group is applying for a 4,800 GHS loan through ASA Initiative FNGO. From this loan Edward would receive 1,000 GHC to meet the financial needs of his farm and help him maximize his income. Among other things, profits from the farm will help pay the school fees for his children. Edward wishes to thank all microlenders for their generous assistance.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":279.03,"image":{"id":1688978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for laborers to weed and harvest his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Abura Koforidua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2014-09-16T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-16T18:50:04Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kofi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":4800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":279.03,"local_amount":992.12,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:47:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1002.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752017123}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T02:48:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":765032,"name":"Khuy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khuy, who is 45 years old and a married man, lives in a community of Prey Veng province, Cambodia.

Amadu lives with his family in Abura Koforidua, in the central region of Ghana. \r\n\r\nAmadu has been farming for the past 12 years, and has gained much experience. He grows oranges on 10 acres of land. He is also a tailor, and though the tailoring business is doing well, his main source of income is still the farm. Amadu's farming association has obtained a contractual agreement with a local company that purchases the crops for processing into juice. He just needs to maximize his profit now, and his only challenge is the difficulty in getting the micro loans from financial institutions locally to finance the costs required to maintain the farm and harvest the crops. In particular, Amadu needs to hire laborers for weeding, harvesting the crops and transporting them to a sale centre for sale. \r\n\r\nA micro loan of GHC2,000 will help increase his profit significantly, and his profits would far exceed the capital he needs to invest in his farm now. Amadu will use the gain from the farm to care for his family, and also help pay the school fees for his children. \r\n\r\nAmadu and his family thank all their micro-lenders for their generous assistance."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1691714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To weed the farm and harvest the crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Abura Koforidua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2014-09-16T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-16T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amadu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kweku","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Idrusu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":768757,"name":"Jerome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jerome is 32 years old.

He is so eager because he can now find a use for his by-product virgin pellets, which will save him carrying firewood after a hard day's work. \r\n\r\nNana and his group have decided to use clean cooking stoves to save the forest and as a way to reduce indoor\/outdoor air pollution. Nana is now applying for 300 GHS to purchase an Elsa Clean Cook stove to protect his family from indoor air pollution and to reduce the cutting of trees from the forest in his village for charcoal and firewood. \r\n\r\nNana and his entire group members say thank you to all their micro lenders for their kind

Venecia is a 54-year-old, mother of four, all going to school. She is a reseller and lives in a small brown and pink wooden house in Les Anglais, in southern Haiti. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to connect to the local solar-powered microgrid, and to finally get rid of her dirty, costly kerosene lamp. Mainly, she is looking forward to being connected, as it will allow her to save money. Venecia and her family will now be able to benefit from a reliable, durable, and clean power source.\n\nAfter running pilots since 2012 that proved the benefits of prepay quality electricity to people in Les Anglais (first with 14 households, and up to 54), EarthSpark International is developing a full-scale, solar-powered microgrid. This micro-grid is expected to meet the needs of up to 500 households. Kiva loans allow EarthSpark to increase the number of beneficiaries by reducing the up-front costs for customers, and will be repaid over time by electricity sales.\n\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click here<\/a>.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1682239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to connect to Haiti's first solar hybrid smart electricity grid.

This micro-grid is expected to meet the needs of up to 500 households.\u00a0Kiva loans allow EarthSpark to increase the number of beneficiaries by reducing the up-front costs for customers, and will be repaid over time by electricity sales.\r\n\r\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\" target=\"_blank\">click

She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to connect to the local solar-powered microgrid, and to stop being intoxicated by candle fumes. Mainly, she worries that regular kerosene use is dangerous for her and her family. Peliana and her family will now be able to benefit from a reliable, durable, and clean power source.\n\nAfter running pilots since 2012 that proved the benefits of prepay quality electricity to people in Les Anglais (first with 14 households, and up to 54), EarthSpark International is developing a full-scale, solar-powered microgrid.

Their brown and pink wooden house has no reliable access to electricity and thus Venecia is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. With all four of her kids still at school, she wishes they had better light for studying at night. A solar-powered micro-grid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Venecia and her family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower cost energy source - she is looking forward to being connected as it will allow her to save money. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to cover the upfront cost of connection to the grid, which she will repay through her payments for electricity.\n\nAn electrical connection dramatically reduces the cost of lighting in towns such as Les Anglais while offering far superior light quality and more generally providing opportunities for people to dramatically improve their quality of life.\n\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click here<\/a>."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1693504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to connect to Haiti's first solar hybrid smart electricity grid.

She is married to Danny, and a mother to their two children.  Their first child is in Elementary school.  She and her husband work hard to meet their everyday needs and to support her child\u2019s schooling.\r\n \r\nJomildred operates a motorized tricycle and owns a small variety store.  Her husband drives the tricycle that carries up to four passengers.  In the Philippines, especially in the provinces  like Palawan, motorized tricycle is a common means of transportation, Jeepneys and buses are limited.  Very few people own a vehicle.  The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, friend\u2019s homes, and to other destinations within their community.  They even transport from one town to the other.  She earns a minimum of 700 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan to use for repairs and maintenance of her tricycle and also to add some grocery items for her small variety store.  She is positive that this will boost her income as motorized tricycle transportation and a variety store is really needed.\r\n\r\nJomildred dreams of being successful in her business so she can provide her children with the best education possible and give them a better future.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1692657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

He speaks with an even tone which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of his customers. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relationships with them. His fodder shop is very famous in the town and that is the reason his business is running well.

If Fredline is denied this loan, she will be affected psychologically because she would not be able to concentrate in class, since she will be thinking of ways to pay her fees. However, she would have asked friends or family members for help.\r\n\r\nShe would entreat the investors to keep up the good work and ask them to invest more in the country because Ghana has more viable investment opportunities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":373.36,"image":{"id":1692484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

The group is located in the town of Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan, Guatemala. Their level of formal education is about 2 \u00bd years.\n\nJuana is 38 years old and a member of the group. She is very grateful for the opportunity to have a loan, especially since she is a single mother, which makes it difficult to get credit.  She has two children aged 17 and 13. Juana\u2019s business is the buying, selling and production of textiles. In order to make her business more profitable and keep up with demand, she has employed two women from her community. With the microloan she is asking for, Juana plans to buy a large amount of thread \u2013 alpaca, wool, and silk. She is very excited that with more material she will be able to generate more revenue.\n\nJuana looks forward to the new loan cycle because she will also benefit from  Friendship Bridge\u2019s \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program which provides an invaluable education in business administration, marketing, budgeting along with learning about health, hygiene and self-esteem. She and the other women of \u201cFlor del Paisaje\u201d are very grateful to the Kiva investors who help make this program and microloans possible - a combination that provides very positive results.

During the raising of the pigs, no problems were found. Pigs can grow big and healthy. They can sell them at a satisfactory price. Sari Madu Group members intend to continue lending in MUK because, in addition to providing loans, MUK also provides training and consulting from the vet for free.\r\n\r\nNi Luh managed to sell the piglets for a satisfactory price. Her sow gave birth to ten piglets, but two died. She earns IDR 150,000 in profit per piglet. The advantage is that she can save money to expand the business. She hopes that MUK will always accompany the group until all members are independent.\r\n\r\nTo continue the effort and increase the number of pigs, the Sari Madu Group went to the next loan. One member decided to stop borrowing after she had enough capital and she continues the pig business with her own money. These loans are used to purchase piglets, especially the superior species. The pig breeding business can help increase their family's income because of easy maintenance and it can be used as additional work. Most of the members work as farmers. \r\n\r\nIn this period, Ni Luh's portion of the loan will also be used to support her husband to purchase seeds and fertilizer. Because Ni Luh, as the head of the Sari Madu Group, can\u201dt come to the meeting due to illness, the client in the picture is Ni Ketut. \r\n\r\nNi Ketut, as the Treasurer of Sari Madu Group, will use her portion of loan to purchase piglets and various kinds of seeds to plant in her garden. She hopes both of her businesses are going well and will give a satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nTwo of the members could not attend the meeting because of illness.
