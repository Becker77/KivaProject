It was what she hoped for, not only an open door but what was behind that door. And what she found was something that defined what she wanted to be. Emma, who is only 19 years old, is single and lives with her parents. She has taken the challenge of life not as an obstacle but as an opportunity to be able to show others what can be overcome in life.\r\n\r\nThe work that Emma does each day with all her effort is working in a pastry shop to thus bring this rich taste to the palate of the people who visit this pastry shop.

","en":"Vasilyi is from Beregovo.  He is 54 years old, married, and the father of two adult children.  He works as a security guard in a factory.  He and his family own their home, a one-story house.  It's been a long time since the rooms have been repainted, the walls have become dirty and cracked.  The floor is always damp because of the humidity in the house.  But most importantly, there is no toilet in the house.  Toilet is outside.\r\n\r\nWith his 20,000 hryvnia loan from Kiva, Vasilyi is planning to improve his family's living conditions.  He wants to whitewash the walls, cover the floor with tiles and laminate flooring, and install a toilet.  All these improvements will make the house more comfortable and also warmer during the winter months.  Vasilyi will take care of all repairs and improvements by himself.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":754.98,"image":{"id":1690281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

has always been a saleswoman and an entrepreneur. At age nine, she started selling gum, fruit, whatever the item for sale that day was, on the streets of San Pedro Sula in Honduras. She moved to the United States as an adult nine years ago and worked as a cashier. Eventually she became a manager for a grocery store in Florida. When she first moved to Louisiana five years ago, she got a job as a hotel housekeeper. But, she said, being a salesperson is so much more interesting. \u201cI prefer to be around people because I like talking with people,\u201d she said.\r\n \r\nSo, she opened her own business, Mancia\u2019s Services, at the local flea market in Gretna, where she shopped over the weekends. She has been selling gold jewelry, clothing and perfume at her stall for almost five years. In recent years, she said, one of the most popular items she has sold has been a type of breathable underwear for men made of Lycra. \u201cAs soon as I put them out for sale, they sell out quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the other vendors at the flea market have asked me to buy them some, too.\u201d So, Eva had the idea to become the exclusive distributor of these boxers, selling them to vendors that serve Spanish-speaking customers in Louisiana.  Though she had clients already lined up, and knew this idea would lead to definite profits, Eva lacked the capital to make a large purchase. Fortunately, while she was driving and listening to her favorite radio station, 1540 AM, she heard an advertisement for Accion Louisiana \u2013 an extension of Accion Texas.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so grateful to Accion,\u201d Eva said. \u201cI have had so many negative experiences with people who have offered bad advice to Spanish speakers and taken advantage of Spanish speakers. And this was the first time I had some helpful advice and assistance. Everybody has been so wonderful.\u201d\r\n\r\nEva used her loan from Accion Louisiana to make a large purchase of merchandise, particularly the Lycra boxers. She said her plans for the future include continuing to expand all aspects of her business, from sales to distribution, and eventually opening her own store. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1692542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To make a large purchase of inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Gretna, Louisiana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2014-09-17T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-17T04:50:03Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":197},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":199.39},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":201.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":204.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":206.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":209.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":211.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":214.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":216.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":219.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":222.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":224.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":227.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":233.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":236.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":238.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":241.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":244.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":247.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":253.7},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":256.81},{"due_date":"2016-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":260.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":227.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.03},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.72},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.7},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.81},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":768816,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles started out as an affiliate in marketing, selling other companies\u2019 products.  After researching market trends, he decided to invest in the beauty industry. Operating out of Lumberton, Mississippi, he created Izy Trends. The company is in its first few months of development and Charles plans to grow Izy Trends into an online sensation. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe beauty industry is huge,\u201d Charles said. \u201cI know this is something we can really grow into.\u201d His product lineup began with an eyelash curler and will soon develop into a one-stop shop for all things beauty. Charles is currently researching additional products he would like to add to his online store. With over two years of marketing experience, he is thrilled to be developing his e-commerce website. \r\n \r\nCharles is grateful that his wife is able to help him with the accounting side of the business and uses her keen eye when it comes to choosing which beauty products to add to the product lineup. \u201cI have seen my wife\u2019s beauty routine and I know the lengths women will go to look their best,\u201d Charles said. \u201cMy wife and I are looking forward to building this business together.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis main focus is to build his web presence, driving online shoppers to his site.

She joined Ruma about a month ago because she wanted to expand her network, learn how to use technology, and learn how to run her small stall more effectively. She feels really excited to expand her business selling mobile phone airtime credits. As the business runs, she hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva in order to provide more mobile services in her community on weekends. In the future, she is planning to expand her business and continue to provide services to her community. Mety is pictured in the photo sitting in her small stall.

They cannot fail to attract the tourist\u00b4s attention and often result in them buying one themselves as a souvenir.  \r\n\r\nMaria, 35, who appears first on the right in the photo, has a lot of ambition.  She wants to make her community well-known and show visitors the work she does with such effort and dedication.  She is single and has four children.  Her first two children already have their own families.  The other two are excellent pupils at the local school. \r\n\r\nMaria works hard to improve and to reach the goals that she sets herself in life.   Her job, which she carries out with such diligence, is to buy and sell different cuts of the typical cloth.  She does this from her own home and in areas close by.  She has been doing this for 12 years.  \r\n\r\nApart from this, she also sells snacks.  She has been in this business with her sister for more than five years.  This particular activity allows them to earn an income to be able to provide for their family and improve their economic situation as well as provide impulse for the community.  \r\n\r\nShe is an example in her area, which is why a group of women have joined forces with her to be able to set up their own businesses which will allow them to generate an income.  \r\n\r\nMaria will use the loan to buy cloth for the typical dresses which she will sell around her neighborhood.  One of her aims is to have a market stall in her area and also to see her children become working professionals.

The socio-economic development of the area has been a major factor, but in addition, the work done by builders and bricklayers is also crucial.\r\n\r\nOne such builder is Manuel, 29.  He has a family with five children.  His first two children have started their own families and the rest are excellent students at the local school.  \r\n\r\nHe has been a builder for seven years and it has since become a good source of income for him and his family.

Rather than reinvesting income into their retail store, Parveen and her husband have to take care of the family expenses. The retail store has run out of stock due to lack of funds at Parveen and her husband's disposal. Therefore Parveen wants a loan to help her husband refill the stocks at the store and also expand his business by including small electrical appliances such as bulbs and lamps plus the stationery which includes pens and registers.

That house was very old and threatened to fall down at any time, especially in the summer season.

She works from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. per working day.\r\n\r\nZuhura has been with Tujijenge Tanzania for more than ten loan cycles, all of which she paid back successfully. She is so trustful, always paying well her loans. Zuhura is so thankful to everyone who supported her group. Her business now is improved to the extent that she can manage to add other items (like drinks and clothes). She used the previous loan cycles to replenish water stocks and opened the shop selling food. She received profit that she used to plow back to her business. She also bought home a TV and cupboards, both for the kitchen and for cloth keeping. She paid part of the school fees and home food expenses.  \r\n\r\nZuhura's dream is to manage a nice family house and for her child to attain high education level. \r\n\r\nShe will use her new credit request to buy a business freezer and drinks for her shop. She will share this loan with her loan group, Mapatano, which consist of two members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

So far, she has been in this career for twenty one years with an average income of USD 5.00 per day.\r\n\r\nSaphal wants to improve the general living conditions of the entire family by having a latrine to use, because there is no latrine in her house now. Therefore, she is borrowing a loan from Kiva to build a latrine. By doing this, she can help her family members gain access to sanitation, promote their health, and help to lessen environmental deterioration. \r\n\r\nShe is thankful for the loan granted through HKL

Shamsiya sells groceries from a bench. She has a lot of experience, since she has already been engaged in this work for more than ten years. Shamsiya wants to replenish her working capital and therefore she is requesting a loan of 3,000 somoni with this

Her daughters attend a school and help their mother with the agricultural business after school. Now Ra'no wants to build a good cowshed for her livestock before the onset of cold weather; however, she does not have enough of her own money to achieve this goal.

The group consists of four hardworking and progressive minded members who came together when they felt the need to encourage each other in their businesses so as to attain business growth. They continually attend trainings offered at Thrive. These trainings have helped the group in managing their credit sales as well as forecasting in their businesses.\n\nAtumire started buying and selling chicken cutlets and fish 10 years ago.

He had previously worked as a hired salesperson at a market and obtained sufficient experience in the retail field. Now Firuz wants to have his own business and work for himself. He purchased a retail outlet at a market and has savings of 250 US dollars. Because this sum is not enough to buy merchandise, he requested a loan. Firuz plans to sell children's clothing and hopes that he will be supported, and will successfully start his own retail business.

These diligent women are unable to save money from their monthly income. A major chunk of their income goes towards buying firewood or kerosene, and a lot of their time is spent cooking over traditional chulha stoves. These chulhas, apart from being time-consuming, also emit a lot of smoke, which plays havoc with their health. This adds to their medical expenses.\r\n \r\nTo tackle these problems, they have approached PAT (MicroGraam\u2019s field partner) to buy Greenway cook stoves. The benefits of a Greenway cook stove are that it leads to fuel savings, minimizes emissions of CO and CO2, supports fast and convenient cooking, is highly durable, and is maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung, and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. \r\n\r\nThey are seeking a group loan repayable in easy installments. Malathy, like the other borrowers, intends to use the loan to purchase a Greenway cook stove. Your loan will help these women to have better health and also help them save a little money.      \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1693880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to buy a smokeless stove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Tanjore, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-09-17T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-17T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malathy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sathya Prabha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pattu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selvi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mangaiyarkarasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Uma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":9800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-17T23:51:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":753000,"name":"Tun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tun is 61 years old and widowed with five children.

This is the first loan for her. She will use it to buy fertilizers and rice seeds for her farmland and pay for labor to plow the field. She hopes that this loan will help her to produce more crops from her farmland so she can support her family\u2019s needs in a timely manner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1672254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers and rice seeds and pay for labor to plow the fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Phnom Proek district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-09-17T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-17T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nheb","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T11:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611976721},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681552051}],"funded_date":"2014-09-23T06:30:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":754094,"name":"Thy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thy, 23, is a villager from Battambang province.
