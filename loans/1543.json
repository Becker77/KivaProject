She has become an example to follow in her community and that is why a group of people have gotten together with Catarina to they can start business and also improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe reason she is asking for the loan is to buy more vegetables so that she can do her selling around the community and in the wholesale market of Solol\u00e1.

So she needs to borrow money to invest in expanding the breeding to create more income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe expects the loan will partly support the investment in breeding and improve her family's life.

Most people work in the field; they arise very early and begin cutting and cleaning the sugarcane at 6:00 in the morning, trying to make the most of the morning and its cool climate.  In the afternoons, the workers come to share their lunch, enjoying the shade of a tree.  The name of the group was chosen because of the faith that they have in the saint, and because he has been the one that has given them the spiritual strength to keep going. \r\n \r\nRosal\u00eda is single, and lives with her mother.  She doesn\u2019t have children but takes care of her niece\u2019s daughter.  It is the child that brightens her days.  For eight years, Rosal\u00eda, better known as \u201cChal\u00eda\u201d, has been engaged in selling soft drinks.  At first, she sold them in her home, but currently she is partnering with her mother and sister.  Among the three, they have opened a grocery store where she is investing in the purchase of soft drinks.  With the profits she earns, she supports her mother by paying a portion of the household expenses.  Chal\u00eda also buys the necessary material to make pi\u00f1atas, leis, and crowns, which she sells in November and December when customers are looking for them.  \u201cI learned to make crowns and wax the paper for the floral leis because my mother taught me; she also showed me how to make pi\u00f1atas\u201d.  In this way, the family earns a little more profit in November and December.  For this reason, Chal\u00eda has requested another loan from VisonFund Mexico.  She will invest in the purchase of soft drinks, juice, and water as well as a little material (balloons, \u201cfloratec\u201d [botanical formula]), crepe paper, wax, colorful leaves, Styrofoam, crown sheets, cellophane, and Scotch tape) for the crowns, pi\u00f1atas, and leis.  In this way, she will begin to stock up and prepare for the products\u2019 sales season.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of the members are\r\n\r\nFelicitas \u2013 grocery sales\r\nMar\u00eda \u2013 clothing

in Tamil Nadu have formed a Self-Help Group (SHG) named Udhaya. \r\n\r\nThirty-year-old Krishnaveni is a daily wage laborer, as are the other members of the group. They work long hours outside, only to come back home and spend a lot of time cooking over traditional \"chulha\" stoves that emit a lot of smoke that is detrimental to their health. The smoke affects the children at home too. Besides, there is always the danger of contracting respiratory ailments hovering over their heads. \r\n\r\nSo Krishnaveni and her group have approached PAT, which is promoting cook stoves as part of their energy initiative with the financial support of Micrograam. The benefits of the Greenway cook stove are: fuel savings, using all solid fuels, minimized emissions of CO and CO2, fast and convenient cooking, high durability, and they are maintenance free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung, and does not require any refurbishing or recurring costs.

He has been married 14 years and his wife sells pupusas (stuffed tortillas). They have 2 children who are 7 and 11 years old. Only his wife and children live with him. Rene is an electrician. He has 7 years of experience. He learned it a bit by studying, but it was a friend of his who fully taught him the job. He works between 6 and 7 hours a day, because as an employer at the mayor's office he works some casual jobs. When he is not working as an electrician, he works the field with his wife since both are farmers. He will use the loan to buy work tools: a drill, a polishing machine and welding equipment. This way he will be able to do his job better, because he has had to refuse some jobs due to the lack of these needed tools. Some day, Rene hopes to have a company of electrical services, because he thinks there is high demand for these services and it would be a great business. He also hopes that his children finish a college education.

Meet Rebecca, a 20-year-old ever smiling farmer from a remote village in Birongo, in the rich highlands of Kisii area of Kenya. She has been actively involved in farming for the last two years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs and various varieties of food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \r\n\r\nRebecca is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry; sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy, and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality which will translate to more income. \r\n\r\nApart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that could have been spent in buying fertilizer. \r\n\r\nYour loan will bring joy to her family because she will be able to support her ageing parents and improve her living conditions. Rebecca\u2019s goal is to save more money so that she can go back to school and through your loan she will realize her dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1693005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is 38 years old and has two children who are currently in school. Rommel, her husband, works as a driver. She oversees the operation of their jeepney unit, and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe has one jeepney with a 14-16 person capacity, for which she is paid a boundary* (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 every day. Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippine.\r\n\r\nCecilia is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan assistance to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her Jeepney unit. She will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants another jeepney unit to be used for their business operation. She hopes that her children will be able to complete their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week. There she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the boundary) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the boundary, minus what he pays for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1692983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

Eleonora bought livestock and grew her business. Today, she has 3 dairy cows,1 calf, 30 sheep and 3 horses. Eleonora also planted potatoes and cereal crops on her land for internal consumption and resale. Eleonora sells ecologically clean and delicious milk to local residents. The milk is in very high demand. She has all of the necessary conditions for keeping livestock, but Eleonora needs to cut hay to prepare feed for the winter, and this is why Eleonora requested a loan in the amount of 12,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to cut hay. Eleonora plans to invest the earnings from this loan into further developing her business and saving money to buy a car for her

She has a high school education and started a farm 22 years ago with 12,000 som (KGS) of startup capital. She currently has one dairy cow, 15 sheep, and one young bull. She sells milk to local residents because there is high demand for delicious organic milk. Erkingul also has a 2.60 hectare plot of land where she grows crops to sell and use at home. She earns about 7,000 som (KGS) per month, which is not enough to support her family.

Thirupurapiyam, a tiny village in Tanjore, Tamil Nadu. Most of their fellow villagers, including these 17 women, work during the days as laborers in nearby industries and farms, and some of them have their own livelihood. They make just enough money to return home in the evenings and feed themselves and be able to repeat the same thing all over again the next day. It is hard for the women, who also attend to the myriad domestic chores, such as cleaning and washing and cooking. Apart from the physical exertion, it is the lack of respite from the dust and smoke, at work and at home, that takes a toll and makes them susceptible to health hazards. Lung diseases are extremely common.\r\n\r\nPAT (Micrograam\u2019s partner) works to address part of the problem. They promote clean, energy-efficient cooking stoves, so that, at least while cooking, the women\u2019s exposure to soot and smoke is minimized. The stoves use dung, agro-waste, etc. as fuel and therefore have low CO2 emissions. They are also very cheap to run and help save significant amounts of money. So, Nalina the featured borrower, and her group have decided to buy these stoves. They are all married and most have young kids. They know it is imperative that they offer their kids as healthy a life as possible, so they can grow up and extricate their families from the poverty spiral they are trapped in. They do not have enough money to buy these stoves outright. They seek to borrow the requisite amount and repay it back within the time."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1692997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal

He transports goods and materials for others, making a small salary, keeping them in poor living conditions as his son is very ill and they can not manage to pay for all of their needs, his medical attention and improve their conditions. Most often, this situation makes Imrane feel depressed and frustrated because her husband works hard for them. Imrane is requesting a loan in order to purchase wood for heating because the wood is at a cheaper cost when purchased before the winter season, and to purchase a stove. She knows that the heat in the winter will help her son and his illness and she will also use some of the money for his medications. Imrane sees this opportunity as a way to help her son and improve their conditions overall. She knows that without the help of the lenders, she would never be able to help her son and family. She is very thankful for the support.

","en":"Gulsara is 51 years old, a widow and a mother of 2 children, both of whom are grown and help their mother. Gulsara is a very kind, happy, hardworking and goal-oriented woman. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry. She has a well-developed business with 10 sheep and 2 cows. She also leases a 0.5 hectare land plot, where she grows rice. Gulsara earns a monthly profit of about 3,000 som (KGS). Clearly, this amount is catastrophically small for living, but, despite all this, Gulsara does not despair and wants to grow her business. This is why she requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock. Gulsara plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding her business and also dreams of organizing a decent wedding for her son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1691461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy livestock in order to grow her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kum village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-09-18T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-18T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":69.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulsara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":570}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":376.63,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":20507.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.37,"payment_id":595436433},{"amount":504.03,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":30761.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":65.97,"payment_id":711411044}],"funded_date":"2014-09-22T03:56:52Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:02:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":769176,"name":"Leona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leona is a 20-year-old businesswoman from Buhera District, Zimbabwe.

She is from an Ashkali community in Kosovo, where most of the women stay home to care for the house and kids. Her husband works for an electric company, but his salary is low. They live in very poor conditions -- common for their area -- and struggle to meet their daily needs. For the first time, Vahide is asking for a loan in order to purchase wood for the upcoming winter season. The wood is typically cheaper to purchase pre-season and they will be able to purchase more now than they can later.

He started his own business with a small amount of money through purchasing a taxi to work as a driver to transport people to earn enough money to open the pharmacy. Soon, he accumulated a good amount of money and purchased a bus and worked on it as a driver to transport people from one station to another.

He knows how to run his business well. Now he has a good experience in his business. The patients and his neighbors have good things to say about him. They describe him as a kind, honest and a hardworking man. Due to that good reputation, Saleh has very many customers, so he wants to enlarge his business more. Unfortunately, his capital is still low. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Saleh applied for a loan of 2,500,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase different kinds of medicines and medical equipment for his

The Kisii area has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming that is good soils, good climate, a good transport system and a ready market for horticulture products. Rose wants to take advantage and start horticultural farming. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming, and through her improved income she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. The financial benefits that Rose will reap are almost immediate, and hence she will be assured of a secure future. Her proximity to an air strip is an added advantage because she plans to start exporting her horticulture to international markets once she has accumulated more profits.

Gulmira invested the loan into developing her buisness. Today, she has 3 cows and 0.20 hectares of owned land, where she grows clover. In order to further grow her business, Gulmira requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy calves. Gulmira plans to invest the earnings from this loan into further developing her business and saving money for her children's education.

Her husband gladly helps Erkinai with running the business. She has all of the conditions for keeping the livestock, but needs to prepare livestock feed for the winter. This is why Erkinai requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy hay and livestock feed and use some of the money to increase livestock headcount.

All hail from Thirupurapiyam village of Tanjore in Tamil Nadu. Most of them are daily-wage labourers and help supplement their household income. \r\n\r\nThese diligent women are unable to save money from their monthly income. A major chunk of their income goes towards buying firewood or kerosene, and a lot of their time is spent cooking over traditional \u2018chulha\u2019 stoves. These chulhas, apart from being time-consuming, also emit a lot of smoke, which plays havoc with their health. This adds to their medical expenses.  \r\n\r\nHence, to tackle these problems, they have approached PAT (MicroGraam\u2019s field partner) to buy Greenway cookstoves. The benefits of the Greenway cookstove are that: it leads to fuel savings, uses all solid fuels, minimizes emissions of CO and CO2, supports fast and convenient cooking, is highly durable, and is maintenance-free and smokeless. The stove operates on all solid fuels, such as wood, agro-waste, charcoal, coal and dry dung, and does not require any refurbishing or recurring cost. \r\n\r\nHence, they are seeking a group loan repayable in easy installments. They intend to use the loan to purchase Greenway cookstoves. Your loan will help these women to have better health and also save a little more money.    \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1693094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas","Green"],"use":"to purchase a sustainable cookstove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Tanjore, Tamil Nadu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":347,"posted_date":"2014-09-18T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-18T17:40:06Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sangeetha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banumathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shantha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iilamandavi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abirami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjalai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":9800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-18T19:42:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":769205,"name":"Chizi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizi is married, with two school-going children.

She started buying these to later sell at a better price, but now she makes them herself.\r\n\r\nMaria will use this loan to buy materials to make rosaries and other crafts.  The fair season is approaching in her area, and this is a good opportunity to offer her products for sale, as they are in high demand.\r\n\r\nMaria hopes that her business will improve, so that with the help of her husband, she can offer her children a better life than the one they had.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1689770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious

Lack of money to acquire better tools and machines has been his main challenge.\r\n\r\nJames is seeking a loan to purchase a water pump. The water pump will make his work at the farm very efficient. With the machine, he will use little fuel to pump large quantities of water uphill for irrigation of his crops and for domestic use.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, James will be able to keep the crops green and healthy throughout the year. This will ensure abundant harvest at the end of the season. Good yields will enable him to cater for the next season\u2019s farming expenses. His family stands to benefit from the machine too because they will not have to use a lot of time and energy fetching water at the stream and transporting it home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1693026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Kolanjiyammal is the featured borrower. \r\n\r\nThese women use traditional stoves for cooking in their homes. The noxious smoke and particulate matter that emanate from the stove is the primary cause for many respiratory illnesses.

who has eight children and lives in the village of Machoge, in the Kisii area of Kenya. As a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Chabumba self-help group that helps enterprising women who have the same vision and goals. Jane has been farming for the past 12 years and through mixed farming, she has been able to take care of her family. She loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows 'Moraa' (from a person's name). Although Jane passionately loves farming, she faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why she is seeking a loan to buy a water tank. Jane comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will assist her to harvest water during the rainy seasons and also store water for home consumption. Harvested water will assist Jane to irrigate her farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops. Jane spends about six hours a day fetching water for her household. The nearest spring is 2 kilometers away, the water is filled with sediments and the queues are very long. But through your loan she intends to put the water tank just outside her house and she will be spending less than two minutes fetching water. She will used the time saved in turning subsistence farming into profitable small enterprises .All that Jane waits for is your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1693137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Kala has been taking loans from the PAT and she is regular in her repayment of the loans on time.    \r\n\r\nAccording to the 2011 census, 70% of India still cooks on timber, animal dung and crop residues. The largest quality issue is that rural India still cooks on the mud stove, which is both inefficient and poses considerable health hazards due to the smoke and soot released. Therefore Kala wants to buy a smokeless stove for her family. The stove is manufactured by Greenway Grameen Infra Pvt, Ltd. It costs 1400 India Rupees (INR). It is more efficient than the traditional mud stove. Traditional stoves consume more time and money. Burning of biomass fuels causes almost 500,000 deaths every year in India alone (Source: WHO 2009). Smokeless stoves prevent sickness and deaths from the indoor air pollution due to cooking activities.   \r\n\r\nKala and the other members of the group are requesting a loan to each buy a smokeless

He has been driving a rickshaw for many years to meet the family's expenses, but now the vehicle requires proper maintenance to keep it in its functional routine. For this reason, Irum has applied for a loan of PKR 40,000, which she will use for her husband. He wants to buy new tires and some auto spare parts, for his vehicle.

They are engaged in diverse occupations and either work as daily wage agricultural laborers,  as employees in small private firms, or they run their own small rural businesses. However, with their meager incomes, they still have some way to go in terms of improving their living conditions.

The smoke not only causes health problems among the family members, but also pollutes their surroundings.\r\n\r\nThis 8-member group is seeking a loan to purchase 8 Greenway cooking stoves.

Amutha has been taking loans from PAT and she is regular in her repayment of the loans on time.    \r\n\r\nAccording to the 2011 census, 70% of India still cooks on timber, animal dung and crop residues. The largest quality issue is that rural India still cooks on the mud stove which is both inefficient and poses considerable health hazards due to the smoke and soot released. Amutha wants to buy a smokeless stove for her family. The stove is manufactured by Greenway Grameen Infra Pvt, Ltd. and costs 1400 India Rupees (INR). It is more efficient than the traditional mud stove. Traditional stoves consume more time and money. Burning of biomass fuels causes almost 500,000 deaths every year in India alone (Source: WHO 2009).

She started buying and selling clothes in 2002. This was after she separated with her husband in 2001 and had to find means of taking care of her two school going children. Juliet has faced countless challenges in trying to make her business viable and successful. She had very little knowledge on how to save and have daily records of all her business transactions. Juliet was also constantly faced with the problems of not offering enough variety to her customers. This led to a decrease in number of her customers. She ended up being indebted as she mostly depended on borrowing from friends and family for school fees money for her children. \n\nHowever, as a result of the training she received at Thrive, Juliet is now able to make daily records of her business transactions and making regular savings.

She invested them in household appliances that she bought at the Golfito warehouse and then sold in the Alajuela area. With her efforts and the passing of time, her small business has grown. Now she sells products by catalog (clothes and plastic utensils).\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to support her children's schooling. At the same time, she is enrolled in a distance secondary education program. This has helped her improve her business, and in the short term, she expects to receive her high school diploma. She has demonstrated excellent reliability on repayments and has managed her loans well, attending to the needs of her customers.\r\n\r\nShe started with a family loan of 25,000 CRC to buy underwear, and with this loan, she plans to maintain her business by taking advantage of the special prices offered in November.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan.

He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kisii region of Kenya .Ondari is happily married and is a proud father of 4 lovely children that he really values and treasures. For the past 8 years he has been involved in mixed farming. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming. He passionately loves dairy farming because of the constant income that he gets and has even nicknamed one of his cows \"Gesanako\u201d.  Ondari practices dairy farming with a difference.  He makes his own fodder by manually cutting and storing it for use during dry seasons. Dairy farming is a very profitable business venture in Ogembo Village and has seen an upsurge in growth, but the demand has been so high that the supply of milk cannot be met. Ondari is seeking a loan to buy an additional good breed of a dairy cow. Having understood the market requirements, he wants to take full advantage of the ready demand that is there. The dairy cow he wants to buy is a quality breed that can produce 10-20 liters of milk a day and this will boost his production level significantly. Increased milk production will translate to more profits; hence, improving his living conditions. The breed of cow he will buy has so many advantages.
