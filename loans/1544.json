Based in Nyamarambe, which is a remote village in the rich highlands of the Kisii area of Kenya, he is involved in dairy, poultry and maize farming. He engages in milk and egg production for commercial purposes, as opposed to many rural farmers who are in it for subsistence. These commercial activities place him in a better position to engage in other agriculture-related businesses, which, in fact, he does. Reuben is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cow shed. This will help significantly in managing the animals\u2019 health and hygiene. He has been in the farming business for at least 24 years. He has no plans to quit in the future, as he finds farming to be not only fulfilling, but also lucrative. However, his biggest challenges are the poor road network and lack of market. With your loan, Reuben will construct a cow shed, which will later come in handy when he scales up and introduces zero grazing. The long-term impact is an increase in productivity and improved animal health. The additional income from this development will go to his children\u2019s education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1693348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She has been farming for 11 years. With her Kiva loan, she would like to buy more fertilizers for rice production. The profits from the business will be used to buy domestic animals such as cows and goats for rearing.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

With the requested Kiva loan, Geraldine intends to make bulk purchases of feed, chicks and vaccines. With the additional profits, she hopes to expand her project into also keeping egg layers.

Ana wants to start reducing her hours at her job and to begin selling household items as a street vendor in the local areas. This will allow her to spend more time with her young son. Ana came to \"Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa\" and was able to take out a loan here as it is the only local organisation that supports entrepreneurs. Ana is very happy as the organisation can make Ana's dreams come true. She will use this loan to buy chairs, tables, clothes, duvets and chests of drawers, which she needs to start her business.

first class in high school,\u201d he says. \r\n\r\nKevin has over 20 years of experience working in bookkeeping, taxes and payroll. At the beginning of his career, he worked for other people, but he was laid off during the recession. \r\n \r\n\u201cI started this business after being laid off from corporate America in 2006. I started taking on part-time assignments. The list of clients grew and the rest is history,\u201d  he says. \r\n\r\nKevin founded KCAA Global in 2009, a personalized accounting firm that serves Hackensack, New Jersey. KCAA has two other employees, and up until recently, Kevin\u2019s wife was also working with him in the office. Unfortunate circumstances have prevented her from doing so. \r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife recently had brain surgery. Now I am the sole provider for my wife and son,\u201d he says. Kevin also helps out his father and brother, a situation which has put a strain on his business and finances.  \r\n\r\nDespite these challenges, Kevin\u2019s business has continued to grow, and KCAA now has an office in Hackensack. Recently, he\u2019s also been recognized for his work. \u201cA client I worked for had an employee who was embezzling funds and I was the whistleblower. We got him indicted,\u201d he says, an effort that landed Kevin in the local newspapers. \r\n\r\nWhile proud of his many achievements, Kevin still faces the financial hardships common to many business owners. \u201cCollections has been my biggest difficulty; there\u2019s always a client who\u2019s late with payments,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nKevin is requesting a loan to help KCAA keep afloat during this difficult time. \u201cThe purpose of this loan is for new accounting software, office furniture and general working capital,\u201d he says.   \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see Kevin through and help KCAA stay in business.  \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":8925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1692615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase accounting software and furniture and have working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New Jersey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2014-09-19T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-19T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":9700,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":9695,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":9700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":181.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":272.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":272.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":279.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":279.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":283.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":298},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":291.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":298.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":299.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":306.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":307.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":311.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":318.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":320.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":327.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":329.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":341.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":342.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":349.06},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":352.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":358.28},{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":361.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":366.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":372.56},{"due_date":"2016-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":376.78},{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":382.41},{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":387.09},{"due_date":"2017-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":392.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.36},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.02},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.93},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.75},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":376.97},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.61},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.29},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":769667,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fe is a married woman with five children.

Many of his clients are also immigrants. \u201cI came to the USA when I was 12 years old. I speak Spanish very well; that\u2019s how I can help most of my clientele that doesn\u2019t speak English.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow this ambitious husband and father of two is seeking extra working capital to invest in his business. \u201cI bought a website domain, but haven\u2019t had the time to develop it,\u201d he says.  \r\n\r\nFranklin needs this loan to finish the webpage, make flyers and business cards, purchase more printers and a desk, as well as a projector for the office\u2019s window.

","en":"This is Asomat, a wise, hardworking and responsible lady from the Rudaki region of Tajikistan.  She is 52, married, and has two sons ages 19 and 23, both of whom are students.  Asomat herself works as a seamstress, a trade she learned from her mother.

Born and raised in Miami, he always felt that the city was missing something that these music legends produced.  This inspired him to found Valholla Entertainment nine years ago, a fresh home-based record label that\u2019s shaking things up. \r\n   \r\n\u201cMy company helps to fulfill a musical void in the city of Miami due to a lack of musicians that represent the city of Miami on a larger scale.\u201d\r\n\r\nValholla offers its talent a variety of services, such as music production and recording, marketing and booking. Currently Valholla represents five artists, including hip-hop artists Kim Maurier and Ramzez. While Vinton is proud of the success Valholla has brought him and his artists, as well as its contribution to the Miami music scene, he feels that his lack of working capital is hindering the company\u2019s growth. \r\n \r\n\u201cWithout proper funding, it\u2019s difficult to move the company to the next level. Many of the music projects released by Valholla have been financed out of my pocket. This puts a limit on our artistic output as well as the quantity and quality of our releases.\u201d\r\n\r\nVinton\u2019s loan will help Valholla expand and improve the quality of its output. \u201cPhoto shoots and music videos are needed to provide visuals to the artist\u2019s songs, which will invoke more interest in the artist and their music.\u201d he says.

start-ups. As a farmer in San Vicente Alto, Oroquieta, he tried his luck and borrowed a loan to jump start his corn production. After several months, he was able to return his borrowed capital. To this day, Mark feels he owes his good fortune to the Cooperative for having trusted him with the money he used for his business. \r\n\r\nRecently, he accessed a loan to purchase farm inputs and fertilizer for the next crop season.

He is a farmer by profession and owner of large areas of cultivation land. He cultivates seasonal crops on his land. Mostly he likes to cultivate rice crops. In his land area, there is no canal system for watering.  Rice crops needs much water for irrigation purposes, so he has to arrange another source for his crops irrigation. Now he has decided to irrigate his land by a tube well system. He wants the irrigation by tube well, because this rainy season has not been effective for water requirements of the rice crops. For this purpose he has to bear some additional amounts. Therefore, Sarfraz has requested for a loan from KIVA\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan.
