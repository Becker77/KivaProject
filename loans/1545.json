The business helps Charles to pay bills and provide for his family. He is requesting a Kiva loan to help him purchase a Zoona branded trading booth. This will help Charles to save on rental costs.\r\n\r\nThis is Charles\u2019 first Kiva loan. He is grateful for this opportunity and explains this will help him to save and make sure his place is easily located. His dream is to expand his business by opening more Zoona outlets in Lusaka, Zambia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1680213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To help him purchase a Zoona branded trading booth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-09-20T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-20T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":101.46,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.31,"local_amount":445,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":445.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751011},{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":445,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":445.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.51,"payment_id":624435716},{"amount":1059.43,"local_amount":7110,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-03T12:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7117.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":95.95,"payment_id":636777400}],"funded_date":"2014-09-26T01:25:23Z","paid_date":"2015-06-03T12:11:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":767876,"name":"Marta Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marta de 30 a\u00f1os de edad habita en vivienda propia junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus 3 hijos de 5, 3 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad.

Meet Phanies, 31, who has persevered against the odds to become a respected farmer in Bonyunyu, a remote village in the Nyamira area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nPhanies, who is single and a mother of one, always encourages farmers in her village to persevere, conquer fear, work hard and engage in farming. For the past eight years, Phanies has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her primary sources of income are milk selling, egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nAlthough she loves dairy farming, she passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d Because of the good profits she earns from poultry farming, she has turned into a beacon of success for many women who seek advice on poultry farming. \r\n\r\nBecause of her high-quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound, and the demand for poultry eggs and meat has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand, Phanies is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity, and hence, satisfy the demand. The love for poultry meat and eggs has grown in Nyamira at a staggering pace. \r\n\r\nPhanies will use her increased income to improve her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from more poultry manure, which she will use in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make her business flourish, and hence, provide a solid education to her child.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1694033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Previously he worked in a call center and also worked carpentry jobs, but due to the hours of his program and his work, he had to stop working to be able to continue with his studies.

He chose to study the field of Industrial Mechatronics (which is a multidisciplinary field of engineering, combining mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunications engineering, control engineering and computer engineering) because it is a very innovative profession that can contribute to the technology of his country. He is currently enrolled in his second cycle of classes. \n\nLuis is doing his technical degree with SENATI, one of Peru's premier technical degree programs. 95% of SENATI students find employment within their technical degree within 3 months of graduation.

For this reason, it is very important for him to have the support of KIVA; he does not want to leave his studies, but wants his parents to feel better about his household expenses. His sister is also a dedicated student who does not want to stop studying. \n\nLuis believes that the work done by KIVA is very admirable, because the loans can benefit people who are studying and

","en":"Galatmo is 45 years old, and she has been working as a seamstress for the past six years.  She receives orders and sews different styles of women's dresses.  She is married and the mother of four children (three boys and one girl).  Galatmo and her family live in a rural area of the Rudaki district.\r\n\r\nGalatmo's husband works and the children are all studying.  One of her sons is a third-year student at a Commerce Institute located in Dushanbe.  His yearly tuition amounts to 4,600 TJS (the equivalent of 925 USD).  Unfortunately, Galatmo doesn't have that much money right now.  For this reason, she is taking a loan of 1,000 USD.  She will use 925 USD to pay for her son's tuition and the remaining 75 USD to pay for his school supplies.  This loan is very important to Galatmo, and she is really hoping to receive your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1691955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The oldest is married and has a family already, while the other two go to school in the community where they live. She puts in an impressive amount of effort. In spite of her age, she is an enterprising woman and says it is never too late to begin to develop and to have a vision for the future.\r\n\r\nThe work she has been doing in a dignified way over the last eight years is buying and selling groceries in her community.

She is a single mother with four children. Her eldest is in high school and the other three are out of school. She manages her own household while operating the business.  Liza works doubly hard to provide for her and the children's daily personal and household needs.\r\n \r\nLiza operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying  supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Aside from this, she also sells souvenir products during the summer season.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan.  She will use the loan to buy groceries, sacks of rice, charcoal and vegetables to expand her product inventory.  This will definitely boost her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLiza aims to grow her business and to be able to send all her children to school.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1694100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her father, a doctor, works at the local clinic, but he has to spend a few months in Russia every year to bring some money home, as his income is very small.  Shahnoza and her family are quite poor.  This year, Shahnoza enrolled at the Khujand State University.  After she completes her studies, she would like to work as a teacher at the school where she used to go when she was younger.

Richard, from Siongiroi, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer of his locality. He has a wife and six children and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops and personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 15 years. Having done farming for such a long time he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Maasai tribe (Richard's tribe) - where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Richard wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Richard has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. \r\n\r\nRichard always says that, \u201cto become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d He has planted so many trees on his farm and dairy food will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Richard will not only benefit from milk but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. Richard has been facing challenges in accessing finances but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Richard chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Richard underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and during the training season, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. \r\n\r\nThrough accumulated profits Richard plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. He plans that through increased income he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester and hence save costs incurred in buying

After retirement he started providing transportation services because his wife does not work and his small pension is not enough to feed his family. So Hakimjon became a taxi driver and has been for the last five years. Hakimjon has one daughter, who is a student and entered the Tajik National University this year in the economics department. Her tuition costs $900 per year, so Hakimjon is asking for a loan of $1000: $900 for the tuition, and $100 for school supplies. He needs the loan because he does not have enough money himself.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also offers direct selling products to her customer. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This will definitely boost her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJocelyn hopes to be able to grow her business and give her child the best education. She only desires to have a happy and quiet life with her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT) community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is known for being hardworking and responsible, with a great desire for personal achievement. Due to lack of economic resources and because of the poverty in which she lived, she did not get the opportunity of higher studies and attended school till grade 7; after that, she got married.\r\n\r\nLata's husband, Nur, aged 43 years, handles his own business of selling mustard oil. It is an essential oil resulting from grinding the mustard seeds and is widely used in cooking in India. He makes his purchases for cash from the markets and distributors in his area in a bulk quantity, then after repacking, sells to the local retail shops. His sales are for cash. He has regular and occasional customers. He began his business many years ago with his own funds and with the goal of helping with the expenses of his household. Today, it is the only source of income for his household.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is to be able to make an increase in the inventory in his business. The current income from the business is insufficient to cover all the expenses. So Lata is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BJS. The purpose of this financing is to invest in working capital by buying more quantity of oil for her husband's business. She hopes the loan will help the business to be a profitable one, will earn more income for the well-being of the family, and will strengthen their economic condition.\r\n\r\nHer main goals are to provide her daughters a higher education. She is thankful to BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1694230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more mustard oil for retailing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-09-20T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-20T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-21T12:51:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":770081,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret is a Ugandan female, aged 30 years, living in Kagadi.

She is married and a mother of two school-going children (one son and one daughter). She is illiterate and can sign only her name but she sends her children to school.  Her illiteracy cannot curb her spirit and dedication to provide a better life to her children. She helps support her family of five by rearing cattle.  Her children are her greatest motivation for whom she works tirelessly.\r\n\r\nSreemati Gita's husband is associated with a small business but his income is not enough to meet all the expenses of the family. This was the reason that Sreemati Gita started livestock breeding to provide her children with food, health and education.  She rears a dairy cow and sells the milk in her locality.

Her husband Galin is 43 years old and as an occupation sells bamboo in the market. Both of them have completed their education up to grade eight. Two of her children are studying in different grades in the small village school of Maynaguri. One is in college. They live in Khagrabari in Jalpaiguri district.\r\n\r\nSarati is a housewife. Her husband sells bamboo in the local market. Rural people widely use boo for building materials.  Moreover, bamboo is used in making decorative items, agricultural tools etc.  Bamboo is strong, durable, smooth, clean, non-sliding and resistant to humidity.\r\n\r\nAt first, Sarati's husband needs to purchase bamboo from the owners of bamboo groves, cuts them into pieces and then sells them in the market. Nowadays, the cost of bamboo is going up. Due to a lack of sufficient capital, they are unable to purchase a large stock.\r\n\r\nThus, Sarati decided to take a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase good quality bamboo. She wanted to invest in this business because there is a great demand for bamboo in her area. Almost every poor family in her rural area wants good quality bamboo to make their kachha houses.\r\n\r\nSarati is sure that she will earn more profit from this business. She dreams that she will enhance her business in the future and earn more with the profit from her business. Her main goals are to educate her children properly so that they come out as professionals.\r\n\r\nSarati is happy and grateful to Kiva and BJS after getting this loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1694256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase bamboo for her husband's business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-09-20T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-20T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-22T17:14:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":770112,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick, 53, is married and lives in Kamwenge, Uganda.

Her major primary sources of income are egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d \r\n\r\nShe sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and, because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound, and the demand has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand, she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity, and hence, satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used in improving her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from poultry manure, which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make her business flourish, and hence, provide a secure solid education system to her children"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1694309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Bungoma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.566667 34.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-21T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-21T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2924.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3044.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3101.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3194.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3362.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3389.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3508.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3713.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3812.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3926.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.45,"local_amount":6529.13,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6544.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680853},{"amount":34.23,"local_amount":3042.26,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3049.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625132},{"amount":38.04,"local_amount":3381.38,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194241},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":6420.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6435.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262106},{"amount":85.99,"local_amount":7643.73,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7661.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600393},{"amount":97.82,"local_amount":9014.18,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9035.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.59,"payment_id":681377250},{"amount":41.53,"local_amount":3968.75,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3978.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.12,"payment_id":711505281}],"funded_date":"2014-09-22T23:14:51Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":769371,"name":"S\u00e9li","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"_ -  \nAg\u00e9e de 52 ans,  S\u00e9li est  mari\u00e9e  et  m\u00e8re d\u2019 un  enfant  r\u00e9sidant  \u00e0 Adidogom\u00e9.

Meet Nahashon, aged 45, who lives in Kutus, a remote village in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nKerugoya area is an area where hard core poverty pervades every home, yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about 50,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. They are like the bones in the \u201cvalley of dry bones\u201d that required only a breath to spring back to life. \r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, Nahashon has been toiling in his farm for the past 27 years .His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that he engages in to the make ends meet. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve. He is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. Nahashon passionately loves dairy farming and as he likes to put it \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart\u201d. He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow but to buy a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and also towards the education of his children. He will also benefit the from cow manure which will be used in increasing the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan he will also be able to build a bio-gas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. This loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions. Nahashon waits for your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1694366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-21T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-21T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nahashon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":67000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4741.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4880.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5022.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5169.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5320.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5476.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5636.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5801.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5970.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6145.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6324.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6509.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.16,"local_amount":5459.89,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5627.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680854},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":4126.08,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625133},{"amount":64.09,"local_amount":5540.57,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5710.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194244},{"amount":62.2,"local_amount":5377.23,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5541.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823575},{"amount":122.15,"local_amount":10559.9,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10883.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264201},{"amount":41.12,"local_amount":3554.78,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3663.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600395},{"amount":64.94,"local_amount":5614.17,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5786.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458917},{"amount":66.61,"local_amount":5969.87,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6152.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.44,"payment_id":681377253},{"amount":90.76,"local_amount":8189.41,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8440.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.97,"payment_id":696587030},{"amount":135.63,"local_amount":12608.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12994.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.2,"payment_id":711505283}],"funded_date":"2014-09-22T11:21:01Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":770203,"name":"Lilian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilian, aged 51, is from Katipa, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

herself as a person dedicated to her business. She is divorced and has three children, but only one lives with her. All of them are independent. She likes to work and spends almost all day in her store that is located inside a Mexico City market. Rosa Maria is asking for a loan to buy more school uniforms, because due to the back-to-school season, she sold all the ones that she had, and she needs to re-stock.

","en":"Dilnoza is a very kind young woman.  She lives with her parents in a rural area of Tajikistan. She is 18 years old and successfully completed secondary school.  She is now enrolled as a first-year student at the Tajik State University of Business and Politics.  She is a good student.  Ever since she was a child, Dilnoza always loved to read books.  Nowadays, she visits her university's library every day after her classes. \r\n\r\nDilnoza needs to pay her tuition, and for this reason, she has turned to IMON and Kiva.  A few years ago, her father became ill and came back from Russia.  He can no longer do any type of heavy work.  He has opened a small retail outlet near the family's house and he makes and sells \"pirozhki\" (baked or fried buns).  Dilnoza's mother helps her husband with this small business.  Dilnoza and her family are poor and are not in a position to afford a college tuition.  Dilnoza is awaiting your kindness and relying on your generosity.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1692041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

the Kiva Fund and everyone, who has helped her with the financing. Today, Beishekan has 4 calves, 2 horses and 30 sheep. She also has 1.00 hectare of leased and 1.00 hectare of owned land, where she grows clover and corn. Additionally, Beishekan is involved in sales at a store that she opened at her house. Her family's monthly profit amounts to about 15,000 som (KGS). In order to further grow her business, Beishekan requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy heifers. Beishekan plans to invest the earnings from this loan into further growing her business and wants to build a house with a large barn for livestock in the future.

This city has 4 rivers which give the city beautiful landscapes; it is a mix of the colonial and modern, and since December 1999 has been a World Heritage Site. Its people are warm and hospitable, like the group members, who make their visitors feel as if they are at home. They continue to maintain the traditions of their people, and are characterized as being hard workers and always are looking for a better future for their families. \r\n \r\nOne of the group members is Guadalupe, 24 years old, who lives in a common-law marriage and has 2 children, ages 4 and 2. Her first son began school this year, her spouse works as an electrical technician, and they don't have their own house since they live in a house loaned to them by a family member. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe takes care of the children at home, and also raises guinea pigs, chickens, and hens. This work has given her the ability to generate an income. The money from the loan is to purchase chickens and animal feed. Her goal is to have a store.

She is 39 years old and happily married to her husband who works as a driver. God blessed them with four loving children. She and her husband are helping each other in working so they can give their family a good future.\r\n\r\nJenneth owns a computer shop. These computers are rented for PHP 20.00 per hour. Still, some families don\u2019t have their own computers so they go to computer shops to encode and print documents. Others rent to connect with their loved ones abroad and others, especially the children and the youth, rent to play games. Normally, computer shops open at 8 AM and close at 7 PM. Her regular customers are the children and youth of their community. She earns PHP 400 a day. Aside from this, Jenneth also buys and sells frozen food products and she likewise offers mineral water which they deliver to their customers.\r\n\r\nJust as any other business owners, she is also hoping that her shop will continue to expand and have more customers and branches.
