She is married to Ricky, a bus driver, and they have children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJosephine operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nJosephine dreams to prosper in her business. She hopes to give her children a good and quality education and that her husband will always be safe from harm, especially when driving.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by  buying  supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales she is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan.  She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  This will definitely boost her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusana hopes to be able to grow her business and give her family a better life.

","en":"Umeda is a cheerful woman and the caring mother of five children. Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia and therefore her whole family relies on her to make ends meet. For more than 17 years Umeda has been working as a high school teacher. She has a great deal of pedagogical experience and her own methods of teaching, and her students respect her very much. Umeda takes care of a very large family. Besides her five children, her husband's parents, who are retired, live with her as well. Despite all these financial challenges, her son is studying at a university abroad and she needs to pay his tuition, which is why she is seeking a loan of $3,000 USD.

She has a ten year old daughter, who is in the third grade in the community school.  Celina grew up with her grandparents because her parents died in the country\u2019s civil war.  Ever since she was little, she has struggled very hard to earn her daily food.\r\n\r\nShe is currently in her last year of high school by distance learning.  She has to work during the week to get income for her daughter.  With effort, she has managed to build a house from cement blocks.  She had always dreamed of living independently with her daughter.\r\n\r\nCelina works on a small scale in agriculture.  She has now learned to make home gardens (cabbage, tomatoes, chilies, and cucumbers).  Thanks to the previous loan, she improved the floor of the house.  It was a dirt floor, and she changed it to cement and sand (solidified).\r\n\r\nIn addition, Celina has worked at an eatery in the city .  She also washes and irons clothes for other people in the community.  \r\n\r\nNow, with a lot of effort, she is engaged in distance learning.  She has to get up at dawn in order to take the bus and go to the educational center.  \r\n\r\nNowadays she also sells lingerie by catalog, and this gives her income to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan from CrediCampo to pay for the high school graduation expenses, which she is now completing by distance learning.  She will spend $300 on this.  She needs the rest to make some small repairs to the house.  Part of the floor that she improved with the previous loan has become damaged, and she needs to repair it.  With the loan, Celina will be able to have a more respectable house for her family.  It will almost be finished.\r\n\r\nIn the future Celina plans to build a retaining wall at the house.  She also has the objectives of continuing to study, to support her daughter in her basic education, and to prepare her for the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":552.67,"image":{"id":1691585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

He has been married to his wife for over 20 years. They have two children who are attending the community school that they have to travel to from Monday through Friday morning to get to classes. They return in the evening, sometimes on foot, because there is no transport in the community. His wife does household tasks. \r\n\r\nHis wife and two children are Nazario's economic dependents. He also supports his mother-in-law since the death of his own parents, she is like his own mother. \r\n\r\nNazario is dedicated to the work of agriculture (planting corn, beans and sorghum) for the family and also part of the crop is sold in the city when he has a good harvest. His is also a laborer. He has a machine that grinds fodder for livestock which he uses for extra income for the family. \r\n\r\nHe learned his work from his parents and a friend. Thanks to them, he always had a reason to work to get ahead. He had no place to live and had to rent a house but thanks to his efforts, he has managed to buy a small plot of land where he has his home with the family. \r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan from CREDICAMPO to buy fertilizer to plant 7,000 square meters of beans. He has already paid $100 in land rental but also needs more rent money for farmland, to make some repairs to the grinder for fodder, and for personal expenses at home. This will help ensure that he will be able to feed his family and prepare his equipment for when the farming season starts and he gets income for the family.\r\n\r\nNazario says that his goals are to continue working to give his children the opportunity to study and achieve success in school and obtain a university degree. He also wants to buy a pair of dairy cows to have another source of income to allow for better development for his family.

She has to drop her off and pick her up every morning from Monday to Friday. Dora grew up with her four brothers who are all adults now and have their own families. She lives alone with her daughter and her mother, who she takes care of. Dora studied up to Grade 6 and left school as she had to work to help her mother.<br \/><br \/>Dora has been working selling clothing since she was 15 years old. She also sells lingerie items like lotions and creams to get economic revenues to get her daughter ahead and to help her mother. She goes out to sell 3 or 4 times per week in the neighboring communities. She worked in a cafe in the city for two years. She buys her merchandise in the city as that is more convenient. She goes alone to buy and leaves her daughter in the care of her mother. She sells in the afternoons when her daughter has come back from school. She decided thanks to the help that a friend in her area gave her. She also grows corn and pays for labor to help her with the work. <br \/><br \/>The loan that she is requesting from  CREDICAMPO is to buy clothing for all ages to later sell in the communities. At this time she has no merchandise as she had a couple of medical expenses for her daughter. She wants to have merchandise to go out and sell clothing and lingerie products.

He is 38, married, and has a university education in medicine.  He worked in medicine for 10 years, then made a switch to the restaurant business a year ago and opened his own diner.  His diner caters to the average person, and has reasonable prices.  He has a variety of tasty offerings for his customers, such as soups, salads, side dishes, drinks, baked goods, and dairy products.  Though it hasn't been open for very long, his diner already has a number of regular customers.  Currently, Bahodur would like to expand his small but flourishing business, and is seeking a loan of $4000 USD to buy a bigger oven, a refrigerator, and an air conditioner for his diner.  He is counting on your kindness and compassion.  \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n

She lives in her own home that is made out of rustic materials. She has very good personal and work references in her community, located in the remote village of Mogenge, Kisii area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nMary is a farmer with 15 years of experience, specifically in practicing dairy farming. She passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding her own cow are the most enjoyable parts about farming. She is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family, and she has always yearned to have more dairy cows. \r\n\r\nMary requested a loan, which she will use to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She has already identified the breed of cow that she will buy. The cow will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk daily. This breed of cow will be producing milk referred to as the ideal drinking milk, because it will contain an adequate amount of fat and the desirable quantities of protein.

Dovush has a large family: husband, four daughters, two sons and two daughters-in-law. Her family has been running a retail business for 12 years. They have a food market, and the sales profit provides the sole source of income for the family. Dovush now wants to expand the product selection at her store because the current selection is running out, making half of the store shelves empty. However, Dovush does not have enough money to achieve her goal. This is why she requested a loan. Dovush hopes to obtain financial support.

She said she is not having any more children because she is too busy with her dairy farming. \r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working mother, living in the rich highlands of Kisii.  She has  farmed for ten years and does not regret it  because she makes a good profit and has improved her farm. Pauline does both crop and dairy farming and is able to earn a decent and honest income. She is an early riser who  goes to her farm to earn a living. \r\n\r\nPauline has space on her farm to utilize in dairy farming. She respectfully requests a loan to buy a dairy cow. Kisii is an area that has a high population and there is a high demand for milk.   Pauline, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that need and earn extra income.

Meet Catherine, 26-years-young, an energetic and hardworking mother of two lovely children. Catherine resides in the Kenyenya area of Kenya. This area experiences one of the best weather patterns that favours crop and animal farming. Catherine has been farming for the past 15 years and the income from it has enabled her to take care of her family and her parents, making sure that they have their basic needs. \r\n\r\nDue to the high unemployment rate in Kenya, Catherine could not find a job to support her family, but she didn\u2019t surrender to that. She started farming, and through mixed farming, she has been able to earn a decent income. Catherine is seeking a loan of KES 20,800 to buy a quality dairy cow. Catherine wants to take advantage of the increased market in milk products. Having an entrepreneurial mind, she cannot let this opportunity pass by. Profits generated from selling milk and its products will be used to repay the loan and to assist her family and the community. \r\n\r\nCatherine intends to use the income generated to improve her living conditions and to impact society positively. Catherine is very visionary and she intends to start a big dairy shop where she will sell milk products such as yoghurt and cream. Catherine is hoping for your

mother of seven, with five going to school. She is a farmer and lives in a small white and blue wooden house in Les Anglais, in southern Haiti. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to connect to the local solar-powered microgrid, and to finally get rid of her dirty, costly kerosene lamp. Mainly, she is looking forward to being connected as it will allow her to save money. Melicia and her family will now be able to benefit from a reliable, durable, and clean power source.\n\nAfter running pilots since 2012 that proved the benefits of prepay quality electricity to people in Les Anglais (first with 14 households, and up to 54), EarthSpark International is developing a full-scale, solar-powered microgrid. This micro-grid is expected to meet the needs of up to 500 households.\u00a0Kiva loans allow EarthSpark to increase the number of beneficiaries by reducing the up-front costs for customers, and will be repaid over time by electricity sales.\n\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click

lives with her husband and her seven kids in the town of Les Anglais in southern Haiti. Their white wooden house has no reliable access to electricity and thus Miclaine is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. With three of her kids still at school, she wishes they had better light for studying at night. A solar-powered microgrid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Miclaine and her family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower-cost energy source. Miclaine is looking forward to being connected as it will allow her to save money. \r\n\r\nAn electrical connection dramatically reduces the cost of lighting in towns such as Les Anglais while offering far superior light quality and more generally providing opportunities for people to dramatically improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nMiclaine is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to cover the upfront cost of connection to the grid. Her loan will help her get connected to her local prepay microgrid. Miclaine will repay her loan through her electricity payments. \r\n\r\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click

Their blue house has no reliable access to electricity, and thus Aldomaine is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. With four of her kids still at school, she wishes they had better light for studying at night. \r\n\r\nA solar-powered microgrid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Aldomaine and her family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower-cost energy source. She is looking forward to being connected, as it will allow her to save money.
