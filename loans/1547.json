The above picture presents Janet, a small scale farmer who lives in the remote village of Kaboi, in the Nandi hills area of Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with six children. For the last 21 years, Janet has been engaged in mixed farming and has never looked back; she really likes what she does. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nJanet finds farming very fulfilling and agrees with the notion that farming is a very profitable business venture. However, she constantly faces the challenge of poor productivity on her farm because of a lack of farm inputs. Janet is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs.

She is fifty-six years old, married, and has six children. She joined 'Hand in Hand Eastern Africa' so as to benefit from the trainings on enterprise development and financial management.

She was helped in her daily activities as a housewife and pig breeder  by her husband. And they can handle it all together. Because the price of 1 kg of pork is getting higher now (it's about 29.000 IDR), Sayu Komang earned a satisfactory profit. \r\n\r\nThe Teratai Indah group feels the same, and with their goal to be successful breeders, two of the original group members resigned and continue the business with their own money.

\r\n\r\nHer husband is a cattle trader and does most of his trading from within his home area. He breeds cattle in his yard as well, and sells the bull calves to the butchers. He has to feed the calf for one or two years until they have grown up and are healthy, which is a very lengthy and expensive procedure. He also trades in buffalo as well. He buys buffalo at a low price and sells them to people at a profit. He has been producing milk from, and breeding, the buffalo. His production of milk and breeding procedures have affected his business because he is unable to cope with demand. \r\n\r\nNow he wants to buy a buffalo to keep his income and business stable, but he has already invested all his savings into the miscellaneous expenses of dairy farming. He does not have sufficient cash in hand to buy a buffalo to continue business smoothly. Therefore, Rukhsana has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of a new buffalo.\r\n\r\nShe is very impressed with the Kiva loan cycle system; she is thankful to lenders.

She is 65 years old and resides with her family in Payatas, Quezon City, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs. She and her partner, who works as a mechanic and driver, are working hard, and they are determined to have a better income.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Estrella would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 20,000 PHP (Philippine pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nEstrella hopes that her small variety store will soon become a grocery store. She dreams of good health and a prosperous life for her family. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1695235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A goat comes in handy because it can be exchanged for cash to meet these immediate needs. Goats are also culturally part of bride wealth, given from the groom\u2019s family to the bride\u2019s family. \r\n\r\nMary, a hard working mother of six, has been practicing mixed farming for the past 18 years. Her primary source of income has been selling a variety of food crops and milk. With the little income she makes, she is able to take care of virtually all domestic needs. That includes paying tuition for her six children and meeting their health needs. \r\n\r\nMary passionately loves dairy goat farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of funds. She is requesting a loan to buy a dairy goat. Through the loan, she will be able to get goat milk that is very important and nutritious. \r\n\r\nDairy goat keeping is a very important enterprise, especially for farmers with small parcels of land like Mary. Through this loan Mary will be able to sell goat milk, which fetches a high price, to her neighbors and to the local market.

Her husband works repairing houses and his work is seasonal, since during the winter there is hardly any demand. Therefore in the cold months he uses his free time to help his wife with her animal husbandry business.\r\n\r\nSharofat is preparing to increase her head count of animals and wants to use this loan to

She makes her living buying and selling the animals so she can contribute to the household income.  With her earnings, she and her husband are purchasing a plot of land to build a house on.  They currently live with her in-laws.  Her business is made easier by that fact that there is a market a few kilometers from their house, where she is able to do her buying and selling.  Her husband his involved in the business too. \r\n\r\nThe loan that Marlene is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to purchase pigs, which is good for her business.  It will improve her business and give her a better income and thereby a better quality of life. \r\n  \r\nMarlene's dream is to finish buying the land so they can build their house.  With regard to her children, she wants to support them until they become professionals, and she will put all her effort into making it happen.

He is married and the father of three children who are getting older and whose expenses are increasing.   His oldest son is enrolling at university this year.  Munir wants to give a good education to his children, so that they all have decent jobs.  Munir's salary is not enough to pay for his son's tuition, which is the reason why he has contacted MDO Arvand to get a loan.   First and foremost, Munir would like to thank MDO Arvand for granting him a previous loan.  With this second loan, he will pay his son's tuition.  Without this loan \/ financial support, it would be very difficult for Munir's son to enroll at the university and to complete his studies.  Munir really wants to help his son and to be able to pay his tuition fees, thanks to this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1687410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Meet Nelly, a 26-year-old farmer from Kericho, which is a small, rural town in the Rift valley of Kenya. The mother of three is interested in many farming activities. Currently, she is doing dairy farming, tea farming and horticulture. She has put the last 10 years of her life into agriculture. She loves it. Her main sources of income are milk and tea. She makes extra money on the side through venturing into other personal businesses. She is very appreciative of the fact that farming has sustainable returns! This enables her to enjoy profits and expand. \r\n\r\nNelly is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter, which is a mechanical device that she will use in cutting straw or hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage to feed her cows. Nelly has been having problems feeding her cow and most of the time her cows refuse to eat but through this loan, the chaff cutter will aid the animal's digestion and prevent the cows from rejecting any part of the food. Through proper feeding, her cows will produce more milk and hence increase income through selling milk. Nelly believes the key to increased milk production is proper health. A dairy cow needs roughage and protein in her diet to be healthy. A healthy cow is more productive, and that means more income for the owner. Through increased income from milk selling, she will provide a better life for her family and afford her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1695457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Benadine from the Nandi hills area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile. Benadine is 24 years of age and a proud mother of one child that she really adores and cherishes. Other than doing domestic chores, Benadine is a very hardworking farmer who has been doing farming for the past four years and has gained so much experience through those years of farming. \r\n\r\nBenadine practices mixed farming. That is, she grows tea and keeps dairy cows and, through these, she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed her cow \u201cTilya\u201d and she really enjoys taking care of her animals. \r\n\r\nAlthough Benadine has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious woman. Her farm has not been producing as much harvest because of lack of fertilizer and good seeds and the presence of pests, and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 to be able to buy farm implements. Through the loan, Benadine will be assured of a bumper harvest and this will translate to more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, Benadine will reap more and this will assure her of comfortably taking care of her family and repaying the loan. Benadine\u2019s plan is to be able to increase her farming and to be able to save more money, so that she can buy more land for farming."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1695477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She had many siblings, and she is one of the eldest, so her mother did not want her to go to school, but to stay at home and take care of the household chores. She has been married since she was 24; her husband is a businessman who sells juices, sodas and water on board buses. She has two daughters aged 7 and 6. Both go to school; one is in kindergarten and the other one in first grade.\r\n\r\nEster sells tortillas with cottage cheese on board buses. She buys the tortillas from her sister and the cheese from another person. She is an entrepreneurial woman, the first one to start with this business in the area where she lives. She has been doing this for five years. She learned from her husband, who started selling on board buses while she was doing something else. She also works as a housewife. When she comes home, she has to take care of her daughters. She pays someone to take care of them while she is working. She does not have any other activity and has to walk one kilometer to go to work, so she does not spend in transportation.\r\n\r\nEster is requesting a loan at CREDICAMPO to buy juices, sodas and water for her husband to sell, and will pay for some cheese and beverages she took on credit.

father. He is a construction veneer specialist. He and his team travel to sites where they veneer ceilings, floors and glass. They get a lot of jobs, but the income is not enough for Amirhon's family. His wife did not have the chance to go to university because she was raising a child. Now that their child is older, Amirhon wants his wife to go to college to get an education and help the family financially. In addition, Amirhon has a sister who is finishing high school this year. Their parents cannot pay for their daughter's education, so Amirhon wants to help his sister. He knows that it is impossible to get a good job without an education and he wants his wife and sister to be financially independent. He does not currently have enough money, so he applied for a loan with MDO Arvand for financial assistance.

He has had a business of gengeduka (produce stall), selling fruits, vegetables, and other shop items. He has been in this business for three years now and is able to make a good profit each month. Ally runs his business from 7 AM to 8 PM daily. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a fifth loan through Tujijenge Tanzania which he will use to buy genge fruits and vegetables to resell. Ally used the previous loans (all of which he paid back successfully) to maintain his business stock of fruits and vegetables. His capital is now greater than before and he serves more people, though people still demand yet more additional products. He dreams to open a big shop selling the same and other items.

people who work taking care of the environment as a productive activity. This is the case with Daniel who since he was small has had the desire to plant in his community. He is 32 years old and has three children. The first is 9 years old and is studying in his community. The second is 6 years old and also is a student and the third child is two years old and doesn't study yet. <br \/><br \/>The business that Daniel has been doing for the past 15 years is a flower plantation, which he learned from his parents. That is the only inheritance they left him and he has dedicated himself to growing flowers so as to have an economic income for his family and have money to support his family. His other activity is as a merchant in his community. Daniel's purpose requesting the loan is to buy flower seeds and fertilizer with the aim of producing a good harvest to improve the living conditions for himself and his family. Daniel wants to be different from his parents and one of his greatest hopes for the future is to buy land to leave to his children so that they can live in adequate conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1693548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy flower seeds and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-09-23T16:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-23T16:30:08Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T09:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2128.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542417168}],"funded_date":"2014-09-27T02:16:35Z","paid_date":"2014-10-17T09:38:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":771411,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aside from her fishing business, Marina, of Taboo, Jimenez, has her own farm of rice which is their main source of income.

degree and working towards social change in her community.  This is her story:\n\nI am 31 years old and was born in Kampong Thom province from a poor family. I am the 6th child among 7 siblings and have 3 sisters and 3 brothers. My parents value education, so that is the reason they have always pushed me to continue my studies. Fortunately, my sister was able to support me to study at university, and I have received love, support and care from the good hearts of my family. \n\nI finished my Bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2003 in the field of Accounting. Because of some challenges in life, I couldn\u2019t continue my Master\u2019s degree as soon as my peers. I dreamed to take a Master\u2019s degree of Management because I am poor in management skills and want to improve. I want to be strong and take this chance to support the vulnerable people in my society. I have one dream \u2013 I want to see youth in Cambodia have access to good education and strong participation in social development activities to make positive change in my country. \n\nMy dream is to complete my Master\u2019s degree before 2015. I met Wedu in late 2012 and received full scholarship for my first year in March 2013. Now I am requesting a Future Income Sharing Agreement (FISA) for my second year and I will pay it back \u2013 I am really happy that this money can go back to support other Rising Stars in the future! Without this help from Kiva and Wedu, I cannot complete this mission on time and would have to extend my study and delay my dream for another two years. \n\nWedu not only supports me with my financial need, but I also receive the mentorship program, which gives me a chance to meet with my mentor, Prakash. He is a really helpful person and has helped me to build my strength and confidence. Since July 2012, I am growing up without limitation.

This is her story:\n\nI am 20 years old and was born in a rural area in Kampong Cham, Cambodia. I am the youngest child in my family and also the only one who had the opportunity to study in university. Growing up, I never even dreamed about having this opportunity, as my family is poor. Since I was young, I dreamed of working in a nice office and being able to speak to the public to solve the problems in our situation, but I thought it could only happen in the movies.  \n\nCurrently, I am studying my Bachelor\u2019s degree at Royal University of Law and Economics with a major in International Relations. I did not know this major before I chose it, but afterwards, I learned I am very skilled at and passionate about global relations. During this time, the most important thing that also brought me much closer to this dream is Wedu. I got to know Wedu about 2 years ago, and with the financial support and strong relationship with my wonderful mentor, I was able to make a new life for myself. I now feel my life is very important to this world. I have a chance to study at university and I have a chance to work on my personal development with the support of my mentor. Wedu provided these things so that I could put my life on a path to becoming a positive change-maker in my community. \n\nMy dream is big, which is to become a high-ranking official in the Cambodian political system, but for now, I think I am better suited to join an NGO, INGO, or IGO. But wherever I work, I am passionate about making a positive change in my community, as well as my country.  With the many unforgettable experiences of being a young lady from a rural area who moved to the city, studied with privileged students, lived alone in a new place, met both bad people and nice people, understood the different standards of living, and so on, I am very confident in my ability to complete my Bachelor\u2019s degree in order to achieve my dream. In the end, I want to help people in my community as much as I can and take my own unforgettable experiences to help build wonderful lives for the next generation of rural Cambodians.  \n\nNote from Wedu: Phearong is expected to graduate in June 2016 and will begin making repayments as soon as she has secured gainful employment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1698480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans","Higher Education"],"use":"To pay for university fees and cost of living expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Phnom Penh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.55 104.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":372,"posted_date":"2014-09-23T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-23T16:40:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phearong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":101,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2022-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2023-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-23T22:42:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":771786,"name":"Trengguli Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are the members of Trengguli Farmer Group who are posing at an established BIRU program bio-digester facility, namely Haryadi, Pangat, Dino, Tono and Narno. This farmer group is led by Pangat (44 years old), who is pointing his thumb up. They all live in Trengguli, a tiny village at Karanganyar, Indonesia. Pangat has a family with three school-aged children.\n\nPangat has high hopes for his family and he strives to improve his economic conditions. He invited four of his fellow farmers to establish a farmer group to develop their business and sharing advantages.  A few years ago, with a minimum investment, he bought some beef-cattle which he fattened for resale. However, he began to see an increasing amount of cow dungs, and he was concerned that it could pollute the water in his community. \n\nAfter receiving information from Yayasan Rumah Energi (YRE) and LKM (a local NGO \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Pangat saw an opportunity to reduce the purchase of non- renewable cooking gas, and he also learned about biogas residues (bio-slurry) utilization benefits. He and his farmer friends want to become energy-independent by purchasing bio-digesters. Since prices have increased sharply, Pangat wants to eliminate his dependence of cooking gas. In addition, bio-slurry can be used and sold as organic fertilizer, organic pesticide, and fodder mixture, all of which can increase revenue for his family and his farmer group. It seems like the biogas program would be the perfect solution to his problem, however, Pangat does not have sufficient capital to purchase a bio-digester.  A loan from Kiva will help him and his farmer group to make this purchase possible.\n\nHe also hopes that building bio-digesters can create new job opportunities for surrounding

They have been married for four years; it is a young family, hard-working and energetic. \r\n\r\nIn 2012 Vitalii began to occupy himself with raising bred and decorative poultry. At the beginning of the business he had just five pairs of poultry, which he bred for pleasure. During two years he grew fond of this occupation and moved forward to 70 birds, made up of about 20 different breeds. In 2012-2013 he took part at different exhibitions in Moldova with bred poultry. His goal is to develop to the number of 500 poultry. \r\n\r\nThe income from his business begins in spring with collecting the eggs that are stored for incubation. The period of collecting  eggs is four months, beginning with February and ending with May. This year he collected about 100 eggs per week. From the beginning of February until May he collected about 1600 eggs. 600 of them were put for incubation, but the rest were sold. The percentage of incubation quality is about 50-60%.\r\n\r\nThe egg prices are sold for between 20 and 30 MDL\/piece. The chicken price starts at100 MDL\/piece and reaches 250 MDL. To achieve the goal, Vitalii began the construction of a summer building for poultry with the area of 100 square meters. To finish the building, he needs building materials for the roof: 100 sheets of slate at price of 96 MDL\/sheet=9600 MDL. Also, 8 cubic meters of wood at  3000 MDL\/cubic meter = 24000 MDL.\r\n\r\nHis own investment in the building was 40,000 MDL. Vitalii asks for a loan of $3000 to finish the summer building for

Moldova faculty Agronomy. Although most young people go abroad to work (most of all to Russia), he armed himself with courage and decided to stay at home\u2026 and not only stayed, but also applied his knowledge from university, starting his own business, a plantation of strawberries. For prosperity of his business, he asks for a loan in sum of $3000 for a term of 12 months, with the reimbursement according to schedule.  \n\nIn 2012 he planted 1,000 strawberry plants of a remontant kind (with fructification duration throughout the summer)  \u201dAlbion\u201d brought from France. He had multiplied the plants and extended the planted area. At the moment he has 30 acres of strawberry crops. Mihai is the only person who directs this activity, employing now and then three other workers who help him at picking and caring for the fruit.\n\nMihail is going to buy about 5 000 square meters of film for protecting strawberries. 1 square meter of film costs 2,60 MLD at present, but its role is multiple: keeping moisture at roots for a longer time, decreasing the degree of water evaporation, and stopping the growth of weeds as well that may appear later. Also due to this film, fruit grows clean, and the risk of being soaked with earth is excluded.\n\t\nIt is also necessary to build a pond that would store 30 cubic meters of water necessary for irrigation of plants. Maintaining a constant level of water temperature is very important avoiding in such a way trauma of strawberry bushes (because of too cold water) as well as preventing shortage of water from wells.\n\nAnd so that Mihai could enjoy the strawberry crop a longer period of time, preventing freezing of the fruit, it is necessary to purchase 5,000 square meters of foil Agril  at 1,80 MLD\/ 1 square meter. Agril protects the plants in case of frost for short time, contributing in such way to obtaining fruit for a longer period of time. To fulfill his plans he needs an investment in total amount of 50,810 MLD. For the total sum of investments, 8 000 MLD is a personal contribution, and 42,810 MLD is the sum requested as a

mother and father. Mr. Oleg's parents are retired. He takes care of an 8 hectare apple orchard with his family. He asks for a loan in the sum of $2,300 to buy a sprinkler. \r\n\r\nMr. Oleg started his business in agriculture in 2000, when he was employed as a tractor driver for a local association that dealt with an apple plantation. In 2005, he inherited a 3 hectare apple orchard from his parents. Using the experience and knowledge he gained over 5 years, he decided to start his own business in this area. With money made from taking care of the apple tree plantation, Oleg bought an MTZ-80 tractor, a cultivator, disc harrows, a plough, and a sprinkler with a volume of 1000 liters. All the equipment was purchased secondhand; he invested about $14,000. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, he planted 2 hectares of orchard, and in 2012, he rented 3 hectares more from other owners. Because of doubling the plot, the irrigation of the orchard became more complicated. The sprinkler with the volume of 1000 liters doesn't cope with the requirements. Facing such problems, Oleg was forced to buy another sprinkler with a volume of 2000 liters, which cost $2,300 secondhand. After buying the sprinkler, Oleg diminished the expenses for diesel oil. The time process of irrigation decreased by half, which gives him the possibility to perform the necessary work for the technology of an 8 hectare orchard."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":766.68,"image":{"id":1694208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

They are engaged in breeding cattle and pigs. \n\nShe lives in the town of Soroca together with her husband and daughter. They are a family of hardworking, united, well-bred people.\n\nIn 2006, after Carolina married Andrian, they got a present from Carolina's granny: a milking cow. At first Carolina didn't want to take the cow because she had no possibility of keeping it in town. At the end of the year, they were faced with the problem that Andrian hadn't found a job. This reason influenced their decision to change their dwelling and buy a house beyond the town, in order to occupy themselves with breeding animals. \n\nAfter doing the calculations, Carolina proved to her husband that the planned business would bring them a constant profit. By only selling dairy products, they would get at least 1,000 lei a month from a single cow.\n\nSo began their small business with only the cow they received as a present from the granny. Over six years, the family created a small farm that consists of nine cows at present: five milking cows, two steers bred for sale and two heifers that will become milking cows later. All these were bred by the family without any investment needed to buy them. Besides cows, there are nine pigs bred at the farm, eight of them are sows that are going to farrow. Little pigs are grown only during the lactation period. Some of them are sold and the rest are kept for growth. Carolina cannot further develop her small business in the stable built in 2009 by her husband Andrian, so she has a room shortage. \n\nThe solution to this problem is to buy a former stable from the village of Pirlita, left over from a kolkhoz (a cooperative agricultural production farm in former USSR).

They average 31 years of age and four children each, and they know one another as neighbors, through ties of kinship, and through their income-generating activities. They sell clothing, condiments and cereals.  \r\n\r\nIn order to build their inventory, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. This is their first group loan cycle.\r\nMrs. Fatoumata (sitting 2nd from the right in the group photo) is a successful reseller of clothing. She will use her loan to buy two bales of used clothing.
