This is Robert. He is the Head Teacher of Sunset Junior School Kulumba, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Kawempe-Kulumba in Kampala with 420 students. Sunset Junior School Kulumba has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining an Ultra Filtration water system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase an Ultra Filtration water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSunset Junior School Kulumba will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Robert ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":686.68,"image":{"id":1686562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Boochi Chache is a primary banana and sugar cane growing area where John owns a 1-acre piece of land. Since 1999, John has derived his income from eggs, bananas, other food crops and personal business.\r\nJohn also keeps a dairy cow that produces milk for subsistence consumption. Today, he is seeking a loan to purchase another dairy cow. The milk from the additional cow will be sold to generate income. During the business appraisal process, the borrower stated, \"Farming is enjoyable as it gives me income for the family. My biggest challenge is that I lack funds to grow it.\" \r\nJohn became a member of a group by the name Gitono in order to access loans from Juhudi Kilimo.

Meet Richard, a 36-year-old energetic, honest and humble man who hails from the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area that favors farming because of the good climatic conditions experienced in that region. Richard never got a chance to advance his education level and thus never got formal employment, but that did not discourage him in life or dampen his spirit to succeed. He started farming and has been doing farming for the past 15 years. Through the 15 years in farming he has been able to take care of his needs, and always provide for his family\u2019s needs through giving them a modest home that is built of wood, and food to eat. \n\nRichard is a very hardworking man, and through his hard work he has been able to multitask. That is why he does poultry farming, tea farming, crop farming and a personal business to make ends meet. Richard is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to purchase farm implements and also to buy additional poultry. Because of the increase in egg consumption in his area, Richard wants to capitalize on that and wants to increase his poultry. Through the increased poultry he will be able to reap more profits, and he will be able to meet the demand and be able to improve his living conditions and standards. Farm implements will assist to boost the production levels and to surpass the levels that he is currently producing. \n\nRichard is very sure that he will reap more profits and be able to impact society positively through employing people to work in his farm and also assuring his family of a more stable and secure future. Having gone through the repayment schedule Richard is very sure of repaying the loan on time, and asking for another one once he completes the repayment. Richard hopes for your kindness.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1688429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm implements and additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-23T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-23T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.21,"local_amount":1796.72,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1796.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680812},{"amount":16.28,"local_amount":1447.07,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625093},{"amount":28.23,"local_amount":2509.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2509.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194186},{"amount":17.29,"local_amount":1536.48,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1536.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823529},{"amount":22.62,"local_amount":2010.52,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264159},{"amount":15.7,"local_amount":1395.77,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1395.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600349},{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":3712.92,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3713.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458886},{"amount":10.9,"local_amount":1044.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":711505242},{"amount":48.81,"local_amount":4546.58,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4547.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.34,"payment_id":752112735}],"funded_date":"2014-09-24T09:01:11Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:30:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":771523,"name":"Neni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neni is 44 years old and married.

My wife is Agustina, she is 37 years old and we have been married for 14 years. She is a homeowner and supports the familiar income through the sale of fresh fruit and snacks. We are parents of 4 kids: Daniel (13), Carlos (9) and the twin sisters Abigail (8) and Sarai (8). We are a happy family and we live in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nDaniel goes to middle school and he enjoys doing different activities related to my work because one day he wants to be like me: an electrician and a mason.  His brother Carlos goes to the elementary school and in his free time he enjoys playing soccer with his friends. My two little princesses go to the same school as Carlos and when Abigail and Sarai arrive at home they play with their dolls.\nWe are a very united family and we enjoy spend time together. We have time for work as wells as we have time to spend with the family.\n\nOne of my biggest dreams is to give my family a real house, a house made with good material. I do not want the same problems:  leaky roof, extreme heat and extreme cold.  I would like to offer a good environment and proper rooms for my wife and my children.\n\nOther dream is to help Agustina to open a local cafeteria because we need extra income. Our children are growing and their needs are bigger because we encourage them to keep studying. For me and their mother this is the best way to assure a better future. If our children study, they won\u2019t experience all what my wife and I experienced when we were younger and no studies. Life can be very hard and we do not want a hard life for our children\u201d.

But due to financial constraints, he is not in a suitable position to buy all these products for reselling purposes. Therefore, Shehnaz has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

His parents have great expectations for Efendi and for his future. \r\n\r\nDue to the living conditions of his parents, Efendi moved out, alone, and left his parents to study Management of Commerce and Harbour Administration at the Akademi Maritim Nusantara, in the city of Cilacap. His parents hope that Efendi can learn diligently and quickly and complete college. All efforts were made by Efendi's parents in order to help him, although his parents only work as laborers in the fields of others.

Bunafsha works on orders and sews traditional Tajik dresses for women.  She does a good job on each order she receives.  The reason why she is taking a loan is that she needs to buy a new sewing machine.  She is hoping to get a new machine, as her current machine often breaks down, which is always an inconvenience.

Her refusal to take the traditional subservient role of a wife has seen her start various farm enterprises that have made her less dependent on her husband when it comes to household expenses. She started with a cereal business that provided her with enough income for her family's upkeep and still managed to save to get into the business where her heart was really in: dairy farming.\r\n \r\nMetrine is seeking a loan to construct a cowshed. From the cereal business, she was able to save enough money and purchased a dairy cow. The cow produces milk for her family's consumption and income. However, she still has a few steps to upgrade her dairy farm and make the cow more productive. \r\n\r\nWith your money, she will put up a cowshed that will significantly enhance dairy management. The cowshed will open way for the zero-grazing model. The model will increase milk production, which in turn will increase her income. \r\n\r\nThe money she will make from the investment will be plowed back to fuel growth of her business.

She has been in this group for one loan cycle. After having paid back her previous credit well, she turned back for her second request to grow her poultry business, as she recommends that she needs to run two batches. As one gets out, the second is close to being ready to sell. <br \/><br \/>Salma is in her early forties, married and has got five children, all of whom are schooling. She has been supporting her family by running a poultry business, 300 chicks per batch. She runs two batches differed in two weeks. Salma starts working at 5:00 am until 8:00 pm daily and is able to make a fair monthly return. She believes that if she raises more chicks, her monthly income will improve.<br \/><br \/>With her second loan requested via Tujijenge Tanzania, Salma will buy 300 chicks for her poultry business.

The group members are small retailers of shoes, wax pagnes (highly colourful and decorative West African cloth) and cereals. The members decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso in order to build up their cash reserves and are on their first group loan.\r\n\r\nOumou (the woman standing second from the right in the picture) has a great reputation as a seller of shoes of mixed quality for men and women. She plans to use her loan to buy 25 pairs of shoes wholesale in Bamako. She makes her sales on the streets of Kanadjiguila to a varied retail client\u00e8le. Thanks to this loan, Oumou hopes to make an average monthly profit of 30 000 francs which will be reinvested in her business. Her aim is to maintain a good working relationship with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1695313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kanadjiguila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-09-24T08:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-24T08:30:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efchata                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mada                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":67962.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793426},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":67962.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793427},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":67962.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758304},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67962.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595318865},{"amount":129.71,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-03T11:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67962.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.62,"payment_id":610752648},{"amount":119.63,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67962.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.7,"payment_id":624542440}],"funded_date":"2014-09-24T21:08:07Z","paid_date":"2015-03-31T11:05:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":770924,"name":"Victoire","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\t\n-   \nM\u00e8re de 2 enfants, elle  est  \u00e2g\u00e9e de  40 ans.

The dairy business is very profitable in this area. Most families rely on milk to feed their children and prepare their meals. Ugali is the staple food of people from western Kenya where Bokoli village lies. Ugali is tasteless as it is made from pure maize flour and water. To make this into a mouthwatering delicacy, it has to be accompanied by sour milk and well-cooked vegetables, and meat for those who can afford it. Milk is also an ingredient in the preparation of vegetables. The heavy reliance on milk allows dairy farmers to do well in this region. The milk prices are always high because of the high demand. Little product marketing is required here because milk is milk. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Dorcas will not only reduce the amount of money spent on milk for the family, but also increase her income from the sale of milk. She will use the profits to grow the business and to keep supporting her family.

The two oldest children go to college, and the younger one to school. Her husband is a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nNarcisa is a housewife who, in addition to taking care of the children, works selling clothes and shoes. She sells them by catalogue from door to door. She always carries her catalogue with her wherever she goes, and shows it to her customers so that they can choose what they want. She then takes the orders and delivers, and collects every 8 days because she sells her merchandise on credit.\r\n\r\nShe has worked in this business for more than five years, and it enables her to help her husband, who does not earn much with his work.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy clothes and shoes.

They have different businesses including buying and selling cosmetics, as done by Fatoumata who is standing on the right in the photo. The women live in large traditional families in N'Tentou, in the sub-prefecture of Kati (Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali). They have been small retailers for several years and are much in demand for their products, including perfumes, beauty creams and foundation creams.

This is their eleventh group loan.\r\n\r\nFatoumata, who is the leader of the group and well-known is N'Tentou, excels in selling cosmetic products.

Moussa did not have the opportunity to progress at school and very quickly became interested in revenue-generating activities, notably the buying and selling of cereals (rice, fonio, millet), groundnuts and various shop products. Having properly repaid his third individual loan, Moussa is on his 4th loan with Soro Yiriwaso which will be used to buy 5 bags of rice and 5 bags of millet from the farmers of Safe Koren, Niazana and Bougoula. He makes his sales mostly for cash, sometimes credit, wholesale and retail, from his home and at the market, to a clientele composed of men and women. Moussa hopes to make an average monthly profit of 75 000 francs which will be used to repay the loan and reinvest in his business buying and selling cereals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1695358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural

The prevailing geological conditions of the village make it extremely suitable for dairy farming. The major challenge he faces is lack of funds to push his dairy farming a notch higher. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The additional cow will help in the use of pasture and will increase milk production and availability to produce more byproducts. Through this loan, Anyona will be able to challenge the existing norms and bring better and advanced dairy farming practices to his village, thus becoming a torchbearer for change in his village for others to follow. \r\n\r\nHe hopes that he will be able to use your loan investment wisely to raise his family's standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1696273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-24T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-24T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anyona","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2208.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2339.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2407.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2477.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2550.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2624.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2701.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2780.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2861.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3031.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.63,"local_amount":2552.12,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2556.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680866},{"amount":22.61,"local_amount":2015.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625142},{"amount":27.3,"local_amount":2433.56,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2437.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194258},{"amount":26.46,"local_amount":2358.51,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2362.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823585},{"amount":27.33,"local_amount":2436.62,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2440.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262115},{"amount":29.09,"local_amount":2592.94,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2596.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264213},{"amount":188.58,"local_amount":16810.47,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":16836.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458927}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T03:44:26Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":771635,"name":"Sibabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sibabu is married and blessed with one child who attends school.

The socio-economic development of the area has been a main factor, but the bricklaying labor and qualified builders have also been crucial.  One such worker is Reyes, a bricklayer who is 65 years old and has a family of three children, who are good school students in their community.\r\n\r\nReyes' job is bricklaying.  He has done this activity for 25 years and it has become a very good source of income for him and his family.  He is very dedicated to his job, which he does in the most correct and quick way.  The second job he does is buying and selling groceries in the community where he lives.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Reyes has asked for will be used to buy bricklaying tools so he can work and do his job better and with more speed.  One of his dreams over time is to become a master worker and teach his children the same trade, and for his children to become professionals.

It groups together women who got to know each other via family and neighbourly relationships. The women have an average age of 29. They are married and have, on average, 2 children. They have different businesses including buying and selling rice, as done by Djeneba who is the sitting on the left in the photo. The women live in large traditional families in Kangare, in the sub-prefecture of Selingue (Sikasso region, Republic of Mali). They have been small retailers for several years and are much in demand for their products, like rice. The group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso program a year ago in order to be able to satisfy their growing customer demand.

Farrukh is involved in his own business to earn a living. He has been involved in reselling dried fruits and vegetables for two years. He was previously involved in dekhan farming and then decided to sell his own harvest. He transports the harvest, obtained from his farm, with his own truck to sell at a city market. He also buys other types of vegetables and dried fruits at a market and sells them in his village. This business yields him a good regular income. And now Farrukh wants to expand his business and build a small retail stall near his house, where his wife will sell different vegetables and dried fruits. This is why he wants to obtain a loan to buy a large selection of vegetables and dried fruits.

Meet Luke, 19 years of age, honest, humble and a very hardworking person. He hails from the Nandi hills area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Luke is still single and has so much that he wants to achieve before starting a family; that is why he is focused and dreaming of being successful.\r\n\r\nLuke never got the chance to go to college because of a lack of fees, but this never killed the zeal that he had for succeeding, and he started farming five years ago on a small plot of farmland that he inherited from his parents. Through hard work he has managed to practice crop farming and animal farming, and has managed to take care of his parents and also take care of his basic needs. Luke grows vegetables, fruits and keeps dairy cows as a source of income. Although Luke has been making profits, he is challenged by timely delivery of products to the market.  This has made his profits go down, because goods reach the market when they are not fresh and hence fetch lower prices. Luke comes from an area that has poor feeder roads and this has been a major problem to him. That is why he is seeking a loan of KES 55,000 to buy a motorbike. \r\n\r\nWith the motorbike, Luke will be able to transport his farm produce to the market and deliver it in a timely manner, and hence it will fetch higher prices. Vegetables, fruits and milk are perishable products and they require quick delivery to the market, so this motorbike will be of so much help. Through timely delivery of his product, Luke is sure of increased profits and this will translate to better living conditions and a secure future. Luke is very ambitious and he is planning that once he has accumulated more profits, he will be able to go back to school.  Through education he will be able to have a more secure future, because education is \u201cthe key to success.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1696360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to deliver his products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-24T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-24T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luke","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3339.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4020.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4186.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4264.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4392.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4623.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4660.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4823.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4943.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5105.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5242.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5398.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.95},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.62,"local_amount":9030.18,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":9143.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680867},{"amount":49.13,"local_amount":4323.27,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4377.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625143},{"amount":50.45,"local_amount":4439.58,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4495.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194260},{"amount":49.01,"local_amount":4313.03,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4366.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262117},{"amount":107.76,"local_amount":9482.74,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":9601.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264215},{"amount":99.29,"local_amount":8737.91,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8847.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458928},{"amount":96.63,"local_amount":8876.08,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8987.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.23,"payment_id":696587040},{"amount":51.96,"local_amount":4916.19,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4977.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.91,"payment_id":711505292},{"amount":9.5,"local_amount":881.02,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":892.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":731022160}],"funded_date":"2014-10-09T04:43:46Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":771693,"name":"Manh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manh is requesting a new loan to buy sewing tools, sewing equipment and materials.

Estudi\u00f3 secundaria completa y un t\u00e9cnico en computaci\u00f3n, pero la falta de empleo en el \u00e1rea de inform\u00e1tica lo llevo a buscar otro medio donde trabajar, lleva siete a\u00f1os trabajando en la bodega de una empresa, realizando cuentas de los productos que entran y salen.

Deposita su confianza en el financiamiento, puesto que est\u00e1 construido a base de madera, tablas y pl\u00e1stico, lo que llega a convertirse en un factor riesgo ya que en estaciones de lluvia los vientos llegan a ser muy fuertes y son capaces de derribar construcciones fr\u00e1giles. Su meta pr\u00f3xima es brindarle un hogar digno a su familia y entre sus planes futuros esta llegar a ser un trabajador independiente y lograr establecer un negocio propio.\n","en":"Success comes with a dose of care and dedication - the main reason that Arles works hard to achieve such success. He completed high school and received a degree as a computer technician, but the lack of jobs in information technology led him to seek other work. He spent seven years working in ca company warehouse, maintaining accounts of incoming and outgoing products. He is 32 years old, married, and has a son who is in school and wants to become a professional.\r\n\r\nArles wants to give his family a better life, which is why he is requesting a loan to build walls for his bathroom at home.

Meet Eliabh, a very hardworking and honest man who decided that he would be independent and contribute to his community by starting dairy farming in Eldoret, Kenya. Deciding what kind of farming he will do was not difficult. \u201cI was brought up with dairy cows raised by my grandfather and grandmother,\u201d Eliabh said. \u201cIt is in my blood.\u201d He passionately loves dairy farming and has been practicing it for the past 10 years. He has never regretted starting to farm. His primary source of income is milk, eggs, and crop farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. \r\n\r\nHe is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Profits from milk sales have enabled him to take care of his family and he has always yearned to produce more dairy milk. The major challenge he faces is feeding his cows. He is requesting a loan to buy a chaff-cutter. A chaff-cutter is a mechanical device for cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage to feed the cattle. Through the loan his cows will be aided in digestion and they will never reject any part of the food. Eliabh strongly believes that through proper feeding of the cows he will reap more and it will lead to increased milk production which will translate into more sales and a better income. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Eliabh\u2019s life is going to change permanently.

Kenya. The climate here greatly favours high-altitude cash crops and dairy farming which he is involved in. He also keeps poultry for eggs and grows vegetables for both consumption and sales. The income he makes from farming is not sufficient to sustain his family of 3 children. This has forced Simon to look for other sources of income which include a salary-paying job and other personal business interests he has invested in. \r\n\r\nSimon is seeking a loan to purchase farmstead equipment. He spends most of his time doing \u2018General farm work', as he put it. His biggest challenge is unfavourable tools. \r\n\r\nPoor farmers in Africa usually do not have the right tools for their work. This makes working on the farm increasingly longer and harder. Your loan will help to improve farm machinery hence indirectly protect the investments that farmers make in the farm. The new modern farm tools you are financing help farmers to have confidence in the quality, reliability and safety of the implements they employ. Your loan will help Simon to acquire tools that are of great importance for improving productivity and yields and reducing time and physical effort. You will have also helped his family's health since there are health implications of using traditional ineffective tools.\r\n\r\nWhen asked, \u201cHow will this loan benefit your family?\u201d Simon replied, \u201cIncreased food security in my household.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1696463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase farm implements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-24T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-24T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.99,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simion","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.13,"local_amount":7402.45,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7584.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625145},{"amount":81.32,"local_amount":7071.2,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7245.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823588},{"amount":92.82,"local_amount":8071.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":8270.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264217},{"amount":99.73,"local_amount":8672.14,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8885.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458931},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":4451.07,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4560.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.81,"payment_id":681377266},{"amount":40.81,"local_amount":3815.89,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3909.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.07,"payment_id":711505294},{"amount":114.82,"local_amount":10515.9,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10775.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.11,"payment_id":731022162}],"funded_date":"2014-10-16T06:07:08Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":771765,"name":"Yanetha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yanetha is a 52-year-old woman who is married to Adulrahim, a 61-year-old man.

After several unsuccessful attempts, Irma applied for the credit to MFO Credo.

She says that this is the first time they are working with Pro Mujer, having joining through the invitation of a campaign that came to the area, promoting the institution. Leandra currently has a business selling food. She learned this business several years ago by helping her godmother, who worked in the same industry. With time, she decided to open her own independent business close to home. \r\n \r\nThe loan she is requesting is to increase her capital to buy starch and boiled corn wholesale, from the wholesaler selling fairs in El Alto, which she would then sell. This work would allow her to generate income to support her family, as she is married and has four children. When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the health care offered by the

She recently successfully completed baking classes and obtained a certificate. Gavhar is now planning to get involved in preparing baked goods. She saved approximately 500 dollars. She is also requesting a loan in the amount of 2000 US dollars. She will use her savings to buy ingredients, and the loan amount to buy a large oven and a table. Gavhar will be involved in baking at home; she has already created her business plan. According to it, Gavhar will be producing 300 buns and sell them to a school cafeteria in her town of Khujand for school children. Her husband and only son will help her with the business. Gavhar's husband is a dekhan farmer, and son works at a children's entertainment center. Thanks to the new profitable business, Gavhar will bring an additional source of income for her family, which will improve their quality of

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

They have two adopted daughters: Lis, 33 years old, and Ulfa, 29 years old. Both of their daughters are laborers.  Daniel has been running the business of Ojek (motorcycle taxi driver) since early 2000. In addition, he has been working as a non-permanent employee of Kupang City Sanitation Department, since 2005. He still works as a motorcycle taxi driver after work, or in the evening, when there are customers who need his service. His wife has her own business, producing \u201cRempeyek.\u201d  Rempeyek is a savory, deep-fried Javanese cracker made of flour (usually rice flour) and other ingredients, coated by crispy batter or peanut brittle.  The Rempeyek snack is sold to the owners of kiosks and food stalls near their residence.<br \/><br \/>Considering his wife\u2019s business opportunity, which is quite good, Daniel wants to help his wife to be able to produce more kinds of snacks. Unfortunately, he does not have enough capital to do so. Therefore, he applied for an individual loan of IDR 4,500,000 from TLM. The loan will be spent on equipment, such as a pasta machine and a mixer, and some ingredients with which to produce the snacks. He hopes that the business will run well enough to enable him and his wife to pay back the loan, and increase their income to meet their family's

He is a hardworking mixed-farmer from Boito village deep in the South Rift region of Kenya.  On a family owned three acre piece of land, he lives together with his mother. For most of his life, he has been helping out on the farm and as a result he developed hands-on experience. He started his own farm projects five years ago and has made a living producing and selling milk and tea from the farm. He also purchased a motorcycle that he uses to offer transportation services. \r\n\r\nIn order to make more income, to diversify the product portfolio and spread risks, Cheruiyot is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. Most farmers in the rural areas keep poultry for cultural and subsistence purposes. To Cheruiyot however, poultry has the potential to be a big business. With an upsurge in the catering industry, the demand for poultry is getting bigger and bigger. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Cheruiyot is going to invest in a lucrative space and make more profits.

of Bhawanipatna town situated in the Kalahandi district of Odisha state in India. Her family is comprised of her husband and herself. The member sitting in the middle of the second row with a raised hand is Banita. \n\nBanita is maintaining her family by doing a milk business. She has three cows, and they are giving ten liters of milk a day, which she supplies to tea stalls. Her husband helps her by bringing fodder from the market and supplying milk to the tea stalls. She is a very active lady, who wants some extra income out of her own efforts.\n\nAt present, Banita's monthly income is Rs.4,500 which is not sufficient to maintain her family. So she, along with 18 members, decided to form a group to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to improve their businesses. From the present loan, she will purchase three cows and supply milk to the hotels. She will earn some extra income to maintain a better life. \n\nThe other 18 members of her group are Sucheta, Jamuna, Kasturi, Kaledri, Amrut, Drapadi, Damayanti, Dipa, Rukuni, Laxmidei, Gura, Amrut, Souri, Kumudini, Tebabati, Josoda, Dusila and Gita.

He didn't go to school because of his parents' lack of interest in schooling, since for them the most important thing was to work in agriculture and they didn't bother with studying. Because of this Jos\u00e9 didn't have the benefit of going to school. He then formed his own family and brought them up with self-sacrifice, helping them to study and learn what they needed, since it is a great help in life.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has a lot of experience in growing crops, because his parents demanded the most of him. These days he knows what nutrition he needs to give to his crops and the right way to look after them for their development.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy fertilizers and manure for his corn, beans and sorghum crops. Jos\u00e9 plans to grow 30 hectares of corn and 20 hectares of beans and sorghum, given that he has the necessary experience.

To support her family, Imelda engaged in various odd jobs and income generating activities that included selling consigned cosmetic items and clothes. From her earnings, she was able to save and set up a small store in her house.\n\nOn November 2010, Imelda was invited by a friend to join SEED where she got a loan to add up to her store's rolling capital. From this, and with the subsequent loans from SEED, Imelda was able to increase her stocks and add up new products such as eggs and frozen meat. Selling of eggs prospered and she established herself as an egg dealer in her community as well as nearby localities. \n\nOn her 6th loan now, Imelda plans to introduce another new product where, like the eggs, she is confident of increased sales and income. On this loan Imelda would buy notebooks, papers, pens and other in-demand school supplies. Imelda knew that no other store in her community is selling these types of items. Often too, school children would have to purchase their school needs from the City Market.\n\nIn the long term, Imelda aspires to continuously increase her capital and income-base by introducing products that are not available from other competitors but needed in her community. It is her ultimate goal that through the success of her business, she will be able to support the educational needs of her children who are now going to college."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1699291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is a 41-year old wife and mother to three school-aged children. As regular employment was elusive to both Cynthia and her husband, the couple decided to set-up a small store in the early years of their marriage. To increase their income, they have also decided to acquire a motorcycle on a loan-basis from a motorcycle dealer's shop. The motorcycle was converted to become a transport tricycle with which Cynthia's husband is the one driving. \n\nFrom both businesses, Cynthia and her husband finished paying their motorcycle loan on time and has added stock to her store. In 2010, the couple thought of setting up a scrap buying and selling business, after seeing the potential of the business and the absence of any competitor in their area. At that time, Cynthia joined SEED and availed a loan to start-up their scrap business.\n\nTo date, the scrap business went well. Everyday various ambulant scrap sellers are flocking their house to sell various recyclable items such as PET bottles, scrap metal, scrap wood and paper.  Buying of scraps include inspection and weighing of the materials which she does in their front yard. Afterward, Cynthia would sort and stock these to a storage area at the back of their house. For Cynthia, in this business, she starts receiving customers as early as 6:00 a.m. until early evening.\n\nEven as the scrap business has been earning well, Cynthia has maintained her store saying that income from this business has helped them sail through times when scraps are being bought from them by bigger shops at a lower price. With diligence and positive habits in savings, Cynthia was also able to buy a new motorcycle. To date Cynthia wants to buy a side car and use the recently bought motorcycle to transport scraps to and from her place. With this, she will be able to save money from renting vehicles when she deliver scraps to bigger shops and at the same time be able to buy from bulk scrap sellers in her neighborhood.\n\nFor Cynthia and her husband, their efforts and commitment to do business well is aligned with their dream of seeing their children finish school. The couple also hopes that they will be able to secure a house of their own in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1699308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a side car for her motorcycle to be used as transport service and for additional rolling capital for her scrap buying and selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Trece Martires, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2014-09-24T20:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-24T20:20:05Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cynthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.75,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T16:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1501.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542650230},{"amount":135,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6006.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561784627},{"amount":135,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6006.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579741984},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7507.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595310084},{"amount":135,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6006.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610700739},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3003.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624384477}],"funded_date":"2014-09-25T12:02:14Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T13:37:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":773975,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"At 60 years old, Helen continues to work to support her family. Originally hailing from Mindanao, Helen and her family decided to migrate in Cavite after her husband was employed as a security guard. To support the family's needs, Helen decided to sell snack items near a bus terminal from where they are living. Income from her business and earnings from her husband's work covered most of their needs and specially with some of their children already gaining financial independence from them.\n\nHowever in 2003, Helen's husband lost his job and their daughter became a single parent. With only little financial support from their other children who at that time have their own families to support, Helen decided to expand her business by vending rice and viand. This was made possible after Helen joined SEED in 2005 and availed a first loan to support her eatery business. The business went well as the location is strategic in terms of potential customers to the business to include bus drivers, terminal employees and passengers. As her income became steady, Helen ensured that she is also paying back SEED and putting also a portion for savings diligently.\n\nFrom these, Helen was able to improve their living conditions. She is able to support the education of her grandchild, and is able to buy appliances to include a television set and a liquefied petroleum gas stove. On top of this after the typhoon that hit Cavite in July this year, Helen was able to have their damaged roof repaired. \n\nHelen is also able to set up another business in the same location near a bus terminal where she sells plastic wares for kitchen, bathroom and general home use. Due to good sales and seeing further potentials in the plastic wares business, Helen trained and has already entrusted the operations of their eatery business to her daughter. \n\nOn her 5th loan now, Helen plans to buy plastic containers to sell her customers in need of potable water storage. The opportunity to sell water containers has been high following the consecutive typhoons that hit Cavite, wherein potable water is not easily accessible and if available comes with a bigger than ordinary price. \n\nIn the future, Helen wants to improve her business space owing to the growth of their family's businesses. As she ages, she wants to ensure that she will be able to impart business skills to her daughter with whom their business will be passed on.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1699465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics

With her husband, Edna owns and manages a shop that sells motorcycle parts and also provide repair services.\n\nWhen Edna and her husband were starting out, Edna's husband worked in a friend's motorcycle shop as a repairman. Slowly Edna's husband learned the trade and eventually when the owner of the shop decided to sell the business for personal reasons, the couple decided to absorb the business. This was made possible with the loan Edna acquired from SEED when she joined in 2010.\n\nFrom subsequent loans in SEED, Edna and her husband was able to put up a variety of other motorcycle parts for sale to complement their repair services. They were also able to buy display shelves to make their stocks organized and attractive to buyers. Apart from these, Edna and her husband is able to send all their children to school as well as finance the medical needs of her mother-in-law who is living with them.\n\nOn her 5th loan now, Edna plans to buy motorcycle replacement parts such as motorcycle wheels, led lights, side mirrors as well as rider and motorcycle accessories such as high speed sniper and leg shields to sell to their customers.

Back then, when dump trucks would arrive at the open landfill, Angelo with other scavengers would be searching for paper, cartons, plastics, metals and other possible recyclable items which he could sell in nearby junk shops. For years this activity has helped Angelo support his family's needs.\n\nDue to his hard work, Angelo was eventually hired as a helper in one of the junk shops in the area. At around the same period, Angelo got married and began to build his own family. As a helper in the junk shop, Angelo was able to learn the business. In 2010, Angelo and his wife decided to put up their own junk shop from their own savings. \n\nThe business went well and Angelo's shop became known in the area, attracting other ambulant scrap sellers from nearby communities. It was at this time that Angelo saw the necessity to have more capital which he needs to buy scraps in volume. In 2013 he joined SEED and was provided a loan to support his rolling capital requirement.\n\nBeing a responsible payer, Angelo was able to have several reloans in SEED. Also, in maximizing other services of SEED to include trainings on business management and development, Angelo was able to steadily improve his business and consequently increase his income. The living condition of their family improved as Angelo was able to have his house repaired by having sturdier roof and walls. He was also able to buy furnitures and appliances which made their day-to-day living more convenient. But more importantly, Angelo's business improved. He was able to construct a storage for the scraps he buys which enables him to stock scraps and sell them at the opportune time when prices are to his favor.\n\nAs Angelo's income grew, Angelo has also improved his savings. On his 5th loan now, Angelo plans to pool the loan amount to his savings in order for him to buy a delivery truck. Presently, Angelo is renting a van which is considerably one of his biggest expense item. With the new truck, Angelo will be able to save on transport expenses and at the same time increase the volume of scraps he deliver to his buyers.

She is a very hardworking and caring mother.\r\n\r\nTogether with this wife, Xolmirzo tries to earn and do everything possible for their children to live in abundance. To provide an additional income, Xolmirzo is involved in fattening up and selling livestock, and his wife helps him with this business. But he has a dream - Xolmirzo wants to make major repairs of his house and add another wing, however, he needs money to accomplish this.

This is why Xolmirzo came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy construction materials in order to repair and add onto the house. Xolmirzo hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand for the support in advance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1083.71,"image":{"id":1681879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

helping to build a country where development is ubiquitous. He is married and has five children. The eldest child is married and lives with his\/her family. The other four children study at the community school. He has to work hard and faces the great challenge of providing for his family and making sure his children can have a promising future and receive a good education.\n\nHe works selling firewood to locals. He decided to do this already when he was a child and has been doing it for six years. It has meant a lot of hard work for him, but he is proud to do it when he thinks of his family: they depend on his income to fulfill all their needs. The community also needs this kind of activity.\n\nSantos is requesting a loan to make some home improvements, since his house is not in good shape and is unsafe. This is why he needs money to repair it. One of his biggest dreams is to see his son grow up and pay for his education. He hopes that he can become a professional and open a construction company that can help the community to develop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":523.45,"image":{"id":1693706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for renovations of his house.

He is 28 years and is not yet married. He completed his studies to be a grade five primary teacher. He got a job, which was short lived, as he was dropped because of his inadequate level of education. His family members were unable to help because they lacked the money needed to further his education to the required level to retain his job. \r\n\r\nThis gentleman, defeated and disappointed, decided to engage in the business of selling matooke (cooking bananas). At first he would buy just a bunch, sell it, and then buy another and sell it. He made profits, expanded his business and even managed to buy a plot of land, which he is developing.\r\nOn top this, he also pays school fees for his young sister, who is in the secondary level of her education.

One of them has a brown eye and a green eye.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of five hardworking members who are happy, attentive and friendly, and all have a business :\r\n\r\nYennsy- jewelry sales\r\nDeissy -underwear sales\r\nVictoria-pastry sales\r\nJosu\u00e9 Aldair-vegetable sales\r\nGloria - grocery store\r\n\r\nGloria is 42 years old, married and has a son who still depends on her financially.  Twenty years ago, she started a grocery store in her home, which has grown little by little.  During this time, Gloria has used her earnings to cover her household expenses and her son's education.  She has also been able to pay to remodel her home and expand her store.\r\n\r\nGloria comments that her good service as well as her large array of merchandise are what have allowed her to increase her customer base.  For this reason, she is seeking a loan to purchase rice, sugar, oil, beans, corn, soup, tuna, cookies, coffee, milk, flour, and canned peppers to meet the needs of her customers.\r\n\r\nThe group thanks Kiva and VisionFund Mexico for the great opportunity that they have given them by providing them with a loan to invest in their respective businesses so that they can continue to grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nGloria is wearing orange in the

He is married and has one child for now. Mansur and his wife live happily and try to raise their child with love and abundance. Mansur does not have a higher education because he could not go to a university due to financial difficulties in his family. \r\n\r\nMansur is involved in his favorite business to earn an income for living. Mansur has been working as a taxi driver for several years. He has his own car, but it has been serving him for a long time and had to be repaired many times. This is why he is currently planning to purchase a new and improved car in order to run and expand his business.

Malohat takes care of her family by herself; revenue from her business is her family's only source of income, which is why her 18-year-old daughter helps her mother with dress orders. They take orders sewing traditional Tajik dresses. Malohat wants to buy another sewing machine to expand her business.

She lives with her partner, and she has a five-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter. Her business is a hardware store. She is understanding, patient, persevering, enterprising, a good mother, responsible, and hard working. Her business is located in the area of Cruce Villa Adela, a place characterized by increasing commerce in all areas and by lower temperatures.\r\n\r\nDani has brown skin, average height, and long black hair. Her manner of dress is in fashion, but she wears traditional clothing (blanket, full skirt, and hat) for celebrations in the area. Her mother tongue is Aymara, and she uses Spanish for her business. Her business is a hardware store with items for construction, including water pipes, electrical wires, drains, paint, cement, sandpaper for walls, wood, etc. She began this activity thanks to her father, who knew construction through rough work and who taught her the most common materials for this type of business. She shares her life with her husband and with her two children, who attend primary school. She dreams of growing her business and of earning a better income for the well-being of her family.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Dani requests a loan to buy construction materials to sell in her hardware store. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1694408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials to sell in her hardware store, with the goal of helping her family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-09-24T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-24T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dani Maricruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":365.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":462.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":527.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":524.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":547.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":590.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":597.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":618.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":658.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":682.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":707.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":716.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.55,"local_amount":365.71,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:58:30Z","rounded_local_amount":370.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561646035},{"amount":67.76,"local_amount":462.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":468.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556525},{"amount":77.24,"local_amount":527.49,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":533.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157210},{"amount":76.69,"local_amount":523.72,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":529.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554109},{"amount":80.16,"local_amount":547.42,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":553.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226651},{"amount":86.52,"local_amount":590.9,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":597.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213838},{"amount":87.58,"local_amount":598.12,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":605.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649563998},{"amount":90.52,"local_amount":618.14,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":625.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046016},{"amount":96.56,"local_amount":659.42,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":667.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681343899},{"amount":308.42,"local_amount":2106.3,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2131.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554186}],"funded_date":"2014-10-21T15:29:12Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:39:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":771922,"name":"Jean Pierre","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Pierre, aged 47, is married with five children between 17 and 4 years old, all of whom go to school.

She works doing cleaning activities in a local hospital and represents the only provider for her family. Her dream is to have a better house where they can live in peace.\nShe said they suffer a lot living in the actual house because the construction materials make the house extreme and unsafe. The house is extreme due to the excessive heat during the spring or summer and it is very cold at night. The house is unsafe because Hermelinda always ask support of her neighbors in the rainy or windy season. It seems like the roof is going to collapse and when this happens, their boys help her but the youngest is afraid of losing the house and begins to cry. Ra\u00fal and Sebasti\u00e1n are good boys and they help their mother in everything they can.\nRa\u00fal goes to high school and he is a good reader. His favorite book is Ventajas de Ser Invisible by Stephen Chbosky. In his free time he loves play soccer but he does not play too often because he has a disease and gets tired very soon. Due his condition he is not able to do hard work. \nSebasti\u00e1n goes to the elementary school. He enjoys playing with the friends and neighbors. \nFor Hermelinda, being a single mom is difficult because she wants to give her children the best.  She wants to provide them a real house in which they can play, do their homework and sleep well. \u201c I want to make them happier. I pray asking God the opportunity to earn a better salary or something that provides me a way to build a house with good material.
