After Community Education by the Field Partner in her community on subjects including indoor\/outdoor air pollution, Vida has decided to take advantage of the opportunity to use an Elsa Clean Cook stove, to improve the health of her family within her kitchen. She is however faced with yet another hurdle - the initial amount to purchase the stove. She needs a microloan facility to purchase an Elsa Clean Cook stove to protect her family from smoke and excessive heat in the kitchen. A microloan of GHS 300 will help Vida to purchase her clean cook stove. Supporting Vida in this way also means saving the trees within the forest within her community.

hard-working women who average 40 years of age. Other averages include five children per woman and four years of formal education. \r\n\r\nThese women are motivated and determined to create better lives for themselves and their families with the \u201cmicrocredit plus\u201d program of Friendship Bridge. The program combines small loans with educational seminars, so that women can develop their small businesses, educate and empower themselves, and eliminate poverty. \r\n\r\nThe Chuguexalense Trust Bank has just welcomed a new member to the group, who is excited to receive her very first loan and participate in the educational components of the monthly meetings. Sebastiana, 28, was only able to receive formal education for two years. She has been unable to speak since she was born, and the school system in her area was unable to meet her needs. Her family was greatly challenged by her condition. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Sebastiana forged ahead with a great will to succeed. She considers herself an independent woman. For 10 years, Sebastiana has had a fruit business. She sells oranges, pineapples, watermelon, and mangos. She is requesting a loan to expand her fruit business and offer more variety to her customers. Without a doubt, Sebastiana is a shining example of someone who faces obstacles and is determined to be an empowered entrepreneur. Her family has been extremely supportive and is proud of her success.\r\n\r\nThe women in the group look forward to the educational components of their monthly meetings. They are eager to learn how to create better lives in their homes, so themes like nutrition, health, and hygiene are quite useful. They want to be successful in their small businesses, so topics like accounting, budgeting, customer service, pricing, and marketing are also quite relevant.\r\n\r\nArmed with their new knowledge and small loans, these ladies possess the tools to empower themselves and leave poverty behind. Kiva investors are greatly valued in this effort. Thank you, Kiva investors, for your generosity and kindness in funding loans for Sebastiana and the other women in the Chuguexalense Trust Bank."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1694743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Chichicastenango. The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cChunima\u201d  Bank is composed of nine women who are Maya Kich\u00e9. The majority of them work in textile production and fabricate ornate and traditional belts, blouses and skirts. Last February, the Trust received a loan funded by KIVA investors. The entire loan has been paid back in full and on time. They are applying for an additional loan that will hopefully be funded by KIVA investors. It will be their second loan cycle.\r\n\r\nCarmen, the 30-year-old President of the Trust Bank, is unique in the group as she doesn\u2019t work in textile production. She is a practical nurse and because of her knowledge in this field, she has opened a pharmacy and offers basic medical services to the people who live in Chunima. There is no formal health center that is permanently staffed in the town, and so Carmen is held in very high esteem. Her pharmacy is quite busy and she has decided that it is time to open another one. She is requesting a loan to stock the new locale with a complete inventory of supplies. The most common ailments are fever and diarrhea.\r\n\r\nCarmen and her husband are keenly aware of the tremendous value of education and their children attend elementary school in Chunima. They understand why a good education is a key to a more successful future. Carmen and the ladies in the Trust Bank participate in educational seminars at their monthly meetings. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares interesting information with the ladies about indebtedness, effective business management practices, as well as hygiene, health and nutrition. They also learn about violence against women, women\u2019s rights and self-esteem. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it is most effective.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the ladies in the Trust Bank, Carmen extends gratitude to KIVA investors for their generosity in funding their loans. They are unable to walk into a bank and secure a loan. Thank you, KIVA investors, for providing the capital so that these ladies can eliminate poverty and face a brighter tomorrow!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":1694742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more medicines for her little pharmacy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chichicastenango, Departamento El Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2014-09-25T01:50:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-25T01:50:24Z","loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":24500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3059}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":396.94,"local_amount":3063,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561649145},{"amount":396.94,"local_amount":3063,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579563996},{"amount":396.94,"local_amount":3063,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595161375},{"amount":396.94,"local_amount":3063,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610557899},{"amount":396.94,"local_amount":3063,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231039},{"amount":396.94,"local_amount":3063,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216769},{"amount":793.36,"local_amount":6122,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6124.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649566970}],"funded_date":"2014-09-25T16:55:14Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":771961,"name":"Maya Kiche Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"San Francisco El Alto is a busy, rural town in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. The economy is based on commercial textile production. Many create traditional textiles including blouses called \u201cblusas\u201d or \u201chuipiles\u201d, skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d and ornate belts called \u201cfajas\u201d. Other textiles are sewn including sheets, pillow cases, pants and undershirts. Capital is needed to purchase supplies for the businesses and competition is fierce. Thirteen women banded together to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMaya Kich\u00e9\u201d. Their goal is to increase sales, generate increased revenue, empower themselves and eliminate poverty for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nCatarina, a single woman who is 30 years old, works in textile production and fabricates pants and shorts with three of her younger siblings. She sells the pieces of clothing by the dozen in border areas where demand is high. Catarina is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase more thread, buttons, fabrics and tags. The revenue that she and her siblings make will help support the family.\r\n\r\nThe women are very aware of the value of education, both for themselves and their children. They want their children to be able to attend school and work hard so that uniforms, books and other school supplies can be purchased. They also realize that to run their households and businesses most efficiently, they need to be informed and empowered. At the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer spends part of the meeting sharing timely information about a wide variety of subjects such as indebtedness, effective business practices, health, women\u2019s rights, hygiene and nutrition. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of the small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.

She buys fish from wholesalers in Selingue and resells locally retail, for cash  and on credit, to a mixed clientele.\r\nFatoumata hopes to earn a monthly revenue of 20,000 West African francs, which will be used to repay her loan and reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1695400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Selinkegny","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-09-25T01:50:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-25T01:50:41Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.98,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aicha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T17:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50971.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542659185},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50971.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793443},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50971.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758318},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50971.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595318881},{"amount":97.29,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-27T10:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":50971.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.71,"payment_id":610752662},{"amount":89.73,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50971.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.27,"payment_id":624542454}],"funded_date":"2014-09-29T23:59:53Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T13:46:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":772030,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana is 52 years old and married with seven children, two of whom are in school.

She is 26 years old and married to Shridam.  She is blessed with two lovely sons, one of whom is a student of grade three and other too small for school. She is illiterate and unfortunate that she could not get the opportunity to study due to her family's financial crisis; she can only sign her name.  She lives with her family in Raypara, a remote region in Jalpaiguri district.\r\n\r\nSakali's husband (29 years old) is a cycle van puller. But his income is insufficient to cover all the family expenses.  So Sakali has been involved in the business of rearing livestock. She has been engaged in this business for the last few years to provide a financial help to her family.  She somehow developed her business to some extent through her dedication and hard work.   She fattens the goats and sells their milk to the local people. Also sometimes she sells the goats to the butcher when they grow up.

Also, it is possible to find various important shops, bank branches, and a park in which there is a zip-line.  During the weekends, senior citizens come to the park to dance Cuban dances as a form of  recreation and they offer a big entertainment to the other visitors.  In the same place, there are volleyball games and fine moments for the sale of ice cream, cracklings, and other foods.  In other words, the community park is a fine place to pass a good weekend.\r\n\r\nFanny is a member of the group.  She is single, but she takes care of her ten-month-old grandson.  Her son helps her with part of the household expenses.  She has seven years of experience in the business of video games.  During this time, she has seen many children and young people come to play \"little machines\" (this is what the video games are known as in the communities and cities of Mexico).  In addition, Fanny does seasonal work (wreaths, beacons, pi\u00f1atas) during the months of November, December and January which she sells in the local market.  With the profits obtained from the little machines, she covers the household expenses. She mentions that she makes the wreaths and beacons simply because they are a pastime \r\nthat allow her to get some earnings which she turns around and invests in more materials.  These days, Fanny needs to maintain the video games and buy the bases for the wreaths since Christmas time is coming.\r\n\r\nThe other members and their activities are:\r\n\r\nAldo - Sale of meat\r\nJos\u00e9 - Sale of groceries\r\nDiego - Mechanic's shop service\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that the four members of the group have in common it is that they are all vendors and each one of their activities leaves them an earning with which they can take care of some expenses, and for this reason the group has this name.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1690562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"to maintain the video games and she will buy bases for the wreaths.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TEZONAPA VERACRUZ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-09-25T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-25T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aldo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diego ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.08,"local_amount":1655,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T18:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1673.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542690557},{"amount":276.81,"local_amount":3605,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T16:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3645,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561823538},{"amount":265.06,"local_amount":3515,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3554,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.84,"payment_id":579807747},{"amount":400.66,"local_amount":5225,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5282.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.55,"payment_id":595349846}],"funded_date":"2014-09-25T07:40:57Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Livingston Sutro","image":null}},{"id":772044,"name":"Marife","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marife is 41 years old, married and the mother of seven children, five of whom are in school, She works very hard to provide for her family by running a general store in the Philippines, and has requested a PHP 10,000 loan from NWTF to buy additional household goods to sell such as soap, milk, sugar, and coffee.

Her husband Saidul, 55 years old, is a farmer and has been involved in the activity of cultivation for a long time.  They live at West Magurmari, a remote village in Jalpaiguri district. Both Tahima and her husband are illiterate and only know to sign their names.  Due to poverty, they could not send their children to school. Her one son is a cycle van puller and other is unemployed. They live in a small mud house that lacks basic facilities like water, electricity, etc.\r\n\r\nTahima's husband started to cultivate vegetables, but later on he started growing paddy.  Now he mainly grows paddy, which has got a good demand in the market, being the staple food for the people of their locality.  He cultivates paddy and with the help of Tahima, he harvests and sells the produce in the local markets. He has a very good relationship with his customers, as he supplies quality products, in cheaper rates and on time.

She lives in free union and has two daughters who are students, one in primary school and the other in secondary. Her companion works as a security official, and she works as a farmer on a small farm that belongs to the family and where she raises bananas. This productive activity is what allows her to help with the school expenses of their daughters, which is the most important thing for her, since with the income of her companion they deal with the basic expenses such as food and other items. Thanks to the loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, she was able to begin her business, strengthen it, and with the passing of the years extend her crops to more than two hectares of land. This is her sixth loan, and she is gong to invest it in basic materials such as seeds, compost, fertilizers, insecticides, plastic bags, cardboard boxes, and other items.\r\n\r\nHer communal bank \"Banco Mujer Aracolpa Ka\u00f1eblocke A\u00f1ita\" is formed by four members. All of them, like Marleni, are going to invest in agricultural activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2341.47,"image":{"id":1694484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Since she wants to be more productive, she has now decided to enter into business herself, purchasing fish in bulk for resale at the market. Last May 14, 2008 both Julieta and her husband agreed to join Paglaum MPC to avail themselves of a loan because they wanted to buy fishing nets. Aside from the financial assistance they received, they say that they also enjoyed the add-on benefits like insurance and savings. She has now applied for a loan of 10,000 PHP to buy fish for resale.

","en":"Yalgash lives with his family in a remote area of Tajikistan. He is married and the father of five children.  He works in animal husbandry, fattening both cows and sheep.  He has been involved in this activity since his youth and he has more than 20 years of experience in this field of work.  He currently owns ten cows and ten head of sheep.  His wife and children help him run the business.  They sell the milk they get from the cows and the wool from their sheep.  They also sell the cows and sheep themselves.  The area where Yalgash lives is very remote.  Every month, he takes some livestock to the central market of his district and sells a few animals.  He is taking a loan of 15,000 somoni to buy some cattle in order to increase his working capital.  He is awaiting your kindness and relying on your generosity.\r\n\r\n

In 1987, Mireille joined a textile factory in Port-au-prince. Unfortunately, the factory closed down three years later.

She decided to sell purses, bags, flags, napkins, dresses and bottles that represent the beauty of the Haitian rich culture and heritage. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, the business solicited a loan from Fonkoze to stabilize its financial performance. The business owner has participated and displayed the business products to the Haitian Diaspora in New York and Miami. In 2010, the shop became a member of the Union Artistique pour la promotion de l\u2019artisanat (UAPA), which helps the artisan business to increase their customer base and gives them an opportunity to participate in cultural fairs.

Dolores is hard-working and every day puts in the effort in order to help his family to move ahead. He works as a fisherman, a job where he also receives help from his eldest son. In addition, from November to April every year, Dolores takes advantage of the sugar season, when the sugar mills grind the cane, in order to earn another income as a labourer. With no mother present, Dolores has had to put in a greater effort but, in spite of this, he will not let himself be defeated and, every day, is looking for ways to improve the quality of life in his household. As a result he now wants to cement the floors and walls of his home as the floor is currently of earth and the walls of adobe. He wants to make these improvements but, without the money he needs to do it, is applying for a loan from FUSAI in order to invest in cement, sand and gravel, and to pay labourers to carry out the work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1694435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales, she is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan that she will use to buy additional quantities of frozen foods and other grocery items.

Her earnings from her store are their source of income to send her children to school and meet their daily needs.\r\n\r\nHelen hopes to be able to grow her business so she could send all her children to college.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. She serves within the local community. Emily earns a minimum of Php 2000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan which she will use to buy sacks of rice, sugar, gasoline, biscuits, instant noodles and beverages to add to her product inventory.  She is positive that her sales and income will increase as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmily hopes to be able to grow her business. She dreams of a more comfortable and better life in the future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Their mother serves the village elders in meetings, and at the same time teaches her children their lessons and also takes care of her grandmother.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD 0.51.

A new beginning has started in her life after she was selected for cabin crew. She is overjoyed. Monica is 19 years old and the eldest among four. Their mother supported them alone after her father passed away from a serious illness. She has been dedicating her life to helping her parents in household matters, even though she was at her young age. \r\n\r\nThis profession is special to her because of the hospitality they render to the passengers across the world. Her academic performance was excellent and she has always been among the top in her class. However, their family financial condition worsens, and she was in an urgent search for a job. She decided to work and support her family by joining the cabin crew. \r\n\r\nHer mother\u2019s undying spirit to nurture and support in shaping her career is her greatest inspiration. \u201cThe credit goes to my mother,\u201d says Monica. Ever since her childhood, she always had dreams to become an air hostess when she grew up. In her childhood days, she would act like an air hostess in the house and play with friends and family, while the others would act like her passengers. She loves the discipline the cabin crew maintains while rendering service to their passengers. \r\n\r\nShe got the selection when the cabin crew interview was conducted in Imphal. It was a dream come true to be among the few who were selected. Now that she is in a position to join the crew, she is in need of financial assistance to pay for the security deposit, which is mandatory for all the successful candidates for the aviation training. She was anxious about where she will get the deposit fee. Fortunately, her friends who are members of Kiva recommended WSDS for education loans to those who need financial assistance. She was overwhelmed to hear such good news. \r\n\r\nAfter availing herself of the loan, she will be able to fulfill her dreams to fly high without any financial pressure and pay the security deposit without any delay. She expresses her immense gratitude to Kiva and WSDS for helping her to break the financial barrier she had, and wishes to pay back the loan amount once she starts earning. \r\n\r\nShe said, \u201cThank you Kiva and WSDS for being part of molding my career to achieve my goals and aspirations.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1697029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the security deposit charges for cabin crew training.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-09-25T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-25T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-25T19:05:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":772191,"name":"Phonekham Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peuy's village takes water from wells and from the local streams.

She is blessed with four children. Jenifer has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. On her farm, she grows maize and keeps poultry and dairy animals including goats. She sells milk, eggs and maize, and when she is not farming, Jenifer offers transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle.\nTo meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money, but farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meager earnings. She said, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \nHer biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Jenifer formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful) which produces milk daily, which Jenifer sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Jenifer. The money Jenifer got from selling the milk was adequate to repay a loan. \nToday, Jenifer is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Jenifer is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health and

The rest will be reinvested in her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1696435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase grocery items, such as papayas, potatoes, and yams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-09-25T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-25T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":203135.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793467},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101567.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758338},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":101567.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595318906},{"amount":193.86,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-18T11:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101567.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.14,"payment_id":610752682},{"amount":178.78,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":101567.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.22,"payment_id":624542474}],"funded_date":"2014-10-19T00:19:34Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T13:45:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":770359,"name":"Grupo Las Creativas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"De 37 a\u00f1os de edad ya con grandes aspiraciones en dar a conocer a su comunidad y a todos los que la visitan la actividad que ella realiza con tanto esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n, casada y vive con su esposo con el deseo de superar en la vida e alcanzar grandes sue\u00f1os que ella quiere realizar en la vida, ella tiene cuatro hijos los primeros dos hijos ya tienen familias apartes y los dos \u00faltimos son excelentes estudiantes en la escuela de su comunidad, (Manuela es la que se encuentra de 1ra de  derecha a izquierda de la fotograf\u00eda)\n\t\nEl trabajo que ella realiza con tanto esmero es la compra y venta de cortes t\u00edpicas dicha actividad lo realiza en su casa y en lugares cercanos de su comunidad donde ella vive, ella lleva realizando dicha actividad durante 8 a\u00f1os, la segunda actividad que ella realiza es la venta de frutas negocio que realiza con una hermana por m\u00e1s de cinco a\u00f1os porque les genera una ganancia para el bienestar de su familia y mejorar las condiciones econ\u00f3micas de su familia y comunidad.\n\nElla ha sido un ejemplo en su comunidad y es por ello que un grupo de mujeres se han unido a manuela para poder emprender sus negocios para que cada uno de ellas pueda supera y tener ingresos importantes.\n\nEl uso que ella le dar\u00e1 al pr\u00e9stamo que ella est\u00e1 realizando es para la compra de mercader\u00eda de trajes t\u00edpicas para luego venderlas por los alrededores de su comunidad.

For many years, she worked as a bookkeeper, and now she is retired and additionally raises livestock. Aiymzhan currently has on her homestead three heifers, 15 sheep and eight steers. She has very good compliments from her neighbors as a kind and hardworking woman. <br \/><br \/>Income from the village homestead allowed Aiymzhan to start construction of a home, however, the money is not enough for interior and exterior decorations and for insulating the walls and flooring. Therefore, Aiymzhan applied to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase plasterboard and particle board for flooring. Wall insulation will reduce expenses for heating the home and save money for the further development of Aiymzhan's

His greatest challenge is obtaining customers in his small village.\r\n\r\nCurrently his wife Krishna is applying for a Kiva loan; through their field partner BJS. She will use it to buy tablecloths, tables and chairs, mattress, flower vases etc. She intends to decorate the furniture in her husband's small shop, which he runs from their house, so he can rent them out. With this loan she plans to offer a higher quality lifestyle to her family.\r\n\r\nShe wants to reinvest the profit to further grow the business.

She stitches a variety of bags like leather bags, cloth bags, foam bags etc. She has chosen this business because it is very popular and profitable in her area and Jhunu has the knowledge in this business. Jhunu wants to serve more customers, so she has to manufacture more bags.\r\n\r\nThus, she needs some capital to invest in her business. So, Jhunu has taken a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase more materials for making more bags to sell in the market. By selling the bags, she can earn more profit for her family. She hopes in the future, with the profit from this business, that she will be able to open a bag shop in the market. \r\n\r\nJhunu is very much grateful to BJS and Kiva for the financial assistance.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1697066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase materials for her existing bag business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-09-25T21:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-25T21:00:19Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhunu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-09-26T00:30:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":771632,"name":"Zafarkhon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0417\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 8 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0417\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u043c\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0440 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u0423 \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0430, \u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435. \u0414\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443-\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0417\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442 \u0422\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0418\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0435 \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u0417\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u0437\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 600 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0435. \u0417\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0441. \u041e\u043d \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435.

She performs this activity at home and at locations close to the community she inhabits. She has been working in this activity for four years. The second activity that she performs is the selling of meals; she has performed this business with her sister for more than three years because this generates profits for the wellbeing of her family and improves the economic conditions of her community.\r\n\r\nMagdalena has been an example in her community and that is why a group of women have joined her in order to launch their own businesses so that they can move forward and have important revenue. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to purchase traditional clothing merchandise so as to eventually sell it around. One of her objectives is to own a shop at the market in her community.     \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1694740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase traditional clothing merchandise.

around to generate higher profits than ever before.\u201d  Now with his new woodcrafts company, Eliteco, this 31-year-old father of three is ready to carve the same success for himself.\n\nWith the support of his wife who comes from a long line of wood craftsmen, Patrick intends to make Eliteco Florida\u2019s number one producer of high quality, handmade wood decor.  \u201cIn my opinion the quality of products produced in the U.S. has dropped in favor of the assemble-yourself style of Home Depot and Lowes.  I want to change this.\u201d\n\nThanks to his work history, Patrick understand what it takes to maintain a business and is currently in the initial stages of raising funds to make his dream come true.  \u201cThe largest obstacle I\u2019ve faced has been trying to figure out how to come up with the capital to start the business.\u201d\n\nOver the past three months, Patrick has been purchasing some of the equipment he needs for woodwork.  However, he\u2019s still missing some of the  most important tools, and these cost a lot of money to ship because of their fragility. Shipping can set Patrick back upwards of $500.00.  \n\nThe loan that Patrick is requesting will go to covering the costs of tools, wood and shipping.  Patrick needs this working capital to launch his business, and slowly transition from managing other people\u2019s businesses, to taking care of his own.
