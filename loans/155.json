Her ability lies in her hands and creativity, which opened doors to dedicate herself to decorating.  Over time, this gave her incentive to specialize in making handicrafts and decorations for various events and milestones.  She has not stopped working for 16 years now, as people solicit her services for special occasions.  In the afternoons, she exhibits her precious decorations in her house, trying always to be ready if called to decorate a reception hall since sometimes events are unpredictable.  Likewise, she is always aware of current trends and latest changes in design, and she tries to specialize in her craft by taking classes in this area.  All of this sacrifice is aimed to help her open a store with two friends, who have the same desire to provide a diverse range of decorations for the home and they hope to create a large enterprise in the future.  This is her fourteenth loan with MFP and, since she became part of this group, she has tried to participate with her colleagues who are very dedicated to the development of the cooperative bank.

She is a hardworking woman who teaches different forms of dance to the children in her neighborhood.  In her free time, she sells a well-known brand of beauty products.  This work requires that she walk through the hills where she lives in order to find new customers.  During the summer the work can be very tedious and the heat is suffocating.  Nonetheless, she is successful with her sales.  Since she offers products on credit, her customers often do not pay on time so every day is a struggle for her to get ahead.  In the future, she plans to open a bookstore in her home and will enlist the help of her husband, who works as a mason.  Martha wants to start this business immediately and is very confident about pursuing it without having to abandon her cosmetics sales.  She is sure that it will go well because she is very knowledgeable about the area where she lives.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the sixth loan Martha has received and she is very grateful to everyone who made this loan possible so that she can continue to work.  She also promises to continue leading the other members of her Communal Bank and motivating them not to fall behind in their payments.  Martha plans to invest the money she requested in the purchase of school supplies so that she can move forward with her bookstore project. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":511743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase school supplies to stock her new bookstore","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-23T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718197},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751872},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934331},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673099},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886929},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153932}],"funded_date":"2010-03-24T00:27:23Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":191570,"name":"Kyehemba Turihamwe Group Of Kyenjojo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"It\u2019s now two-and-a-half years since an evergreen and enterprising N.

Merlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Merlyn is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Merlyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling of fruits and vegetables in the local community.  Julieta has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Julieta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Julieta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Julieta from ASKI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Lorry is borrowing PHP 11,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Lorry aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She retails to a mixed-gender clientele from her home, door-to-door and in the 'Chateau de Segou' market, and accepts cash or credit.\r\nWith this loan, Oumou hopes to make an average monthly profit of 15,000 CFA, which will be used to reinvest in her activity and to pay for her children's healthcare."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":807429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy groundnuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paye                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.66,"processed_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":68071.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120283},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882116},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699212},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655477},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874273}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T03:37:19Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":318597,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Her husband works as a mason. \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s works as a housewife and sells Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women), in order to earn her own income and be able to help out her husband with the household expenses.  She works three days a week, mostly in the mornings while her daughters are in school.  This makes it easy for her to make her runs.  She sells on credit and collects every two weeks.  She\u2019s been doing this for two and a half years and things have gone well for her.  She enjoys her work because it doesn\u2019t prevent her from being with her daughters and helping them when they need it.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be to buy perfumes, creams, and cosmetics so that she can take advantage of the special offers and sales this month.  She has been part of the communal bank for two years and she likes it because the loans are easy to get.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to provide the best for her daughters.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":939061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-12-09T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774757},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183126},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318583},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":206.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":206.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033627}],"funded_date":"2011-12-11T13:19:00Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:26:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Yudy is married and the mother of two children aged 3 and 8, whom she has always wanted to provide with everything they need.\r\n\r\nAs her husband's income is not sufficient to cover their household expenses, Yudy began a business by purchasing a dairy cow which earns her income on a daily basis from the milk that she produces.  Thanks to this, she is able to contribute financially to the household expenses.\r\n\r\nYudy currently has the potential for her customer to purchase more milk than she is able to produce with just one cow, and for this reason she is hoping that a loan will provide her with the possibility of purchasing another dairy cow to increase her milk production capacity and allow her to generate better income.\r\n\r\nYudy hopes in this way that her income will increase considerably, and in this way she can provide her family with a better quality of life.  She also hopes that her children will be able to have access to a better education, and that in future they will have financial stability.

They have two children who are 12 and 18 years old and both are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nImelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty.

He provides transport services to his passengers within the city. He also provides pick up and drop off services for school children. \r\n\r\nShameem has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband, who wants to repair his rickshaw. His rickshaw is unreliable and doesn\u2019t run for long hours, which is affecting his income. With a fully repaired rickshaw, he will be able to do his work more efficiently and make more money. \r\n\r\nShameem is hopeful that a loan investment will be profitable for her husband and it will result in good profits for him.

She earns her living by operating a fish vending business.  Her husband Quirico, who is 45 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 7 to 21 years old. Rosario joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosario has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 26,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 22,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Rosario L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Despite this limitation he is not discouraged; on the contrary, it gives him the incentive to work with greater determination to realize his goal.\r\n\r\nBecause he wants to increase his production, now he has a nursery with four thousand little coffee plants, which he plans to plant at the end of the year and so begin to produce in greater quantities.

She embroiders for a living, an art that she learned thanks to some friends. Over time she has become more creative with her embroidery, and now these friends are very happy to have helped her. She used to sells tamales in the markets, and needed an additional activity to increase her income. Thanks to this art, everyday she receives a good quantity of polo neck sweaters to be embroidered, an activity which she carries out at home. Nevertheless, she continues selling tamales, as she receives orders for different holidays when large quantities of this dish are served to guests.\r\n\r\nAlionza's priority is to install an embroidery workshop, as it is a very profitable business thanks to increasing export orders, and having adequate machinery would help her greatly. She has been a client of MFP for four years, and this is her fifth loan. MFP has helped her to build relationships with people and form part of good team that works responsibly.

Maria has two kids, and both are in school. She has been running a grocery store for six years. It all started because she didn't have a job and needed to feed her family. Maria believes that with a loan, her business can get a little further ahead; she wants to have all the resources necessary for investing in her store.

She is married and a mother, though all her children are already of age and so are no longer in her care nor in their father\u2019s care.  Victorine has been to school through the 5th grade, that is, through primary school.  Then, she learned how to sew, something she has been working at for a few years. \r\n\r\nAlong with sewing, Victorine has been selling various items: candies, cookies, canned foods (milk, sardine, tomatoes), sugar, pasta, soaps for the laundry, dishes, and bath, batteries, candles, etc., and this business has in the end supplanted her sewing.  She has already benefited from four loans with Alid\u00e9 and has repaid them.  She needs funding to diversify her business by selling pub products and fruit juices.

She raises pigs to supplement her husband's income and to make life a little bit more comfortable for their family.\r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 1991 but stopped in 1999. She rejoined in July of 2006, so that she could get a loan to raise pigs to augment their family income. She buys the piglets, feeds and fattens them for several months and then sells them. This adds PHP 4,000 ($83) to her family's monthly income.\r\n\r\nThe income she earns from raising pigs in her backyard for the last 3 years has helped her family a lot especially with 7 children still going to school. This is why Nieva is committed to continue and expand with this activity so that she could increase her income potential.\r\n\r\nThe PHP 18,000 she is borrowing will allow her to buy more piglets and feed than her previous loan which she ably paid off because of the weekly easy-payment scheme.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She has been a widow for years and currently lives with her six adult children.\r\n\r\nRemedios owns a general store which has been around for 35 years. She also prepares barbecue and sells it to customers. Remedios makes rags from textile trimmings and sells them to customers. She also finds time to sell cosmetics and apparel through the direct-selling scheme.  From these activities, she could realize a monthly income of $980.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the Kiva field partner, Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative, in 2006.  Her previous loans with the co-op were used to purchase textile trimmings from garment factories.  She used some of the money to buy more items for her store, such as soft drinks.  Now on her tenth loan cycle, Remedios is applying for a new loan amounting to P45,000.00 which she will spread out through all her business activities.\r\n\r\nRemedios would like to see her general store someday grow as big as a commercial grocery chain, so she could help a lot of people by providing quality products at a cheaper price.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":379614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

After finishing school, he started to engage in land cultivating, but it was not very profitable because of the deficiency of cropland. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, in order to find better place to live, Nuraly decided to move to the Chui region in the north of the country. Gaining a wide experience in raising livestock, Nuraly started his business in cattle breeding, which became the main source of income for his family. With initial capital of 10,000 Kyrgyzstan soms (KGS), he managed to earn about 12,000 KGS monthly.  Due to his strong efforts, Nuraly has established his farm and today it has two bull calves and still needs to be developed.  \r\n\r\nNuraly plans to use the loan of 80,000 KGS to broaden his business through buying three bull calves.

She is married and has one child, age 6.  In 2005, she established her meat shop business.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supoorts her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy goats and chickens for her business.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Bimala plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   In Nepal, the meat is always fresh.  In small stalls along busy roads, open air butcher shops sell chicken, goat, and water buffalo by the kilo.  The stalls are piled high with product and sales are brisk.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase additional stock at better prices.  This increase in purchasing volume creates greater profit margins for the borrower.  This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She had always wanted her own business, and 5 years ago she established one selling used clothing in the Barrio Central neighborhood of the city of Bluefields. The clothing she buys is from the United States and she buys it in Managua. With this business being well-established, Lesbia has a good network of habitual customers, and she lets them know when she has a new bundle of clothing.                                              \r\n\r\nLesbia is married and has 4 children. Her husband is a taxi driver and helps with the family\u2019s expenses. Lesbia has already received a loan from ADEPHCA and she used it to grow her business and she had no troubles with the payments for the loan. Since she had such success with the first loan, she is requesting another. With this money, she will buy a bale of children\u2019s clothing for US $200.00, a bale of adult clothing for US$150.00, a bale of sheets for US$150.00, and a bale of towels for US$100. She has sold the majority of these things in the past, but she will use a part of this loan to grown her business to include sheets, which she has never sold but which customers are requesting. \r\n\r\nLesbia has many dreams for her family. She currently has a wooden house, and she would like to build one of cement. Also, she has children who want to go to good universities in the city of Le\u00f3n, which is located in a different area Nicaragua. She says it is difficult and expensive, but she wants the best for her children and so she keeps working hard for them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":280050,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":24,"youtubeId":"sP6toPRbTBE","title":"Lesbia Elisalda - Kiva entrepreneur from  Nicaragua","thumbnailImageId":280050},"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy one bundle each of children's clothing, adult clothing, sheets, and towels.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bluefields","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 -83.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":76,"posted_date":"2009-03-04T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lesbia Elisalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35926956},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382189},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52888962},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110355},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531796},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963352}],"funded_date":"2009-03-04T21:58:33Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:36:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":96535,"name":"Albertine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A.

Albertine is married and has three children, of which only the eldest goes to school.\r\nSince she was a child, Albertine has been selling fish, first with her mother, then on her own. But two months ago, Albertine also started to sell food (prepared beans, to be eaten with bread or manioc flour and red oil). Albertine has already received two credits with ALID\u00e9. She requested a third loan to strengthen her food sales activity. Albertine hopes to help her husband who is a fisherman with her profits, to buy a small boat to go fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meaning of ALID\u00e9 in Benin local language - Fon - is \"a path always exists for the poorest\". Benin is a small West African country located next to Nigeria, with a GDP per capita of $1,500. ALID\u00e9 offers special credits at 0% interest rate for very vulnerable people, and is part of a group that soon will launch a program of heath micro-insurance for the beneficiaries of a micro-credit.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by anne-laure behaghel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":291064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a bag of beans and gari (manioc flour), 50 litres of red oil, a basket of chili, a basket of oignons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T11:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albertine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15014.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938700},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":20019.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396325},{"amount":2.08,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1000.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904225},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-21T07:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":12011.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126255},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12011.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549686},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12011.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983477},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":12011.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895846},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12011.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735427},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12011.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110622953},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":12011.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019660}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T13:10:33Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anne-Laure Behaghel","image":143395}},{"id":100631,"name":"Fuao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fuao T., 26, is married with one child.

C. is from the progressive town of Dasmarinas, Cavite. She is 36 years old. Her husband Rafael, 46, is a farmer. They have a very young child.  \r\n\r\nTheresa owns and manages a general store. She also sells prepaid credit for mobile phones. Her store is six years old and has a monthly profit of about $370 per month.  \r\n\r\nShe attributes her store\u2019s success (and her personal success as well) to having joined the Kiva field partner, the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative, in 2007.  \r\n\r\nTheresa needs a loan of P13,000 to build up inventories for her store. Competition is stiff in her area. \u201cA store with many items to sell is always inviting to the customers\u201d, she says.  She dreams of converting her general store to a big grocery outlet someday.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n

Her husband, Ramon, 49, works for a funeral parlor. They have four children; one of whom is in college, and two are in high school.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has been in the beauty salon business for fifteen years.  She likes the idea of making people physically beautiful. She gets tired at the end of the day, especially in peak season.  She says she can\u2019t afford to hire help at the moment because her salon is just too small.  But, small as it is, she earns PHP 25, 000.00 a month.  Her profits go to the education of her children as well as to the family\u2019s basic daily needs.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, she joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  She has recently applied for a new loan in the amount of PHP 42, 000.00.  She will use the funds to purchase supplies for her parlor\/salon. \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Anita is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His property has 12 \u201cmanzanas\u201d (1 manzana = 1.68 acres), and he uses different areas for different activities.  He uses two manzanas to grow basic grains (beans and corn) and ten manzanas to raise livestock.  He plants basic consumable grains like beans and corn and raises cattle.  That is the reason for the loan.  He will buy two small bulls to raise until they gain more weight.  He will then sell them for a better price than what he paid for them.\r\n\r\nThis client set up and started his work activity with an inheritance of five manzanas of property that his parents gave him.  He started to grow basic grains like beans and corn on that property only during the winter season.  Since he was 13 he has always done this field work.  He did this with his wife\u2019s help; she helps with other important activities in their house.  An example of a normal work day is for both of them to get up very early to prepare the tools he will take to the field.  His wife prepares the food he will take to his work.  This way they both support and help each other in their work.     \r\n\r\nHe currently continues with his agricultural and livestock activities.  He hopes to continue improving his work activity in order to be able to increase his operation all of the time.  In the winter season his primary source or way of working is farming.  In the summer he gets an alternative source of income from raising livestock.  This allows him to improve his income.\r\n\r\nThis is Ram\u00f3n Alejandro V.\u2019s first year of working with Ceprodel, and it is his first loan.  The impact and benefit that he expects for his family and himself is positive.

The profit from this business has been the main source of family income. \r\n\r\n<p>Now that she and her husband have secured access to capital, her proceeds are better than before. For that reason, she is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much bigger amount. Specifically, the loan funds will be used to buy spare parts and pay for maintenance of her tricycle.  This will enable her to grow their business further so that they have savings in the future.

a single mother of five children, four of whom are below the age of 15, was born on June 18, 1977. The family lives in a six-room apartment at the Elemighong quarter in the Belo Subdivision of Cameroon. Foctina's greatest problems were that she did not attain a primary school education and that she needed business capital to take care of her children. The search for business capital was addressed by the encouragement to join the GHAPE program by  women who were already GHAPE members in her community. A  member since 2009, Forctina took her first loan of 50,000FCFA to buy Irish potatoes to sell. She says sales were very lucrative, enabling her  to repay the loan with no problem and also pay her children's tuition fees.<p>\r\n\r\nForctina is now requesting her second loan from GHAPE to buy five bags of potatoes for 23,000FCFA per bag; she will use 10,000FCFA from her savings  to pay for the transportation of her products to the Belo weekly market. She is confident of business success due to her many customers who are grateful to have the potatoes at their doorsteps for very reasonable prices. Forctina appreciates working with GHAPE because of their low interest rates and very manageable repayment methods.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE <p>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust with its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":789710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

After Hurricane Stan destroyed a local church, she opened her home to those that needed a new place to worship and recover from the devastation. The fact that the worshipers are of a different denomination than she is makes no difference to her.  Although Dolores is single and has no children, she opens her heart and home for those in need.  She also shares her home as a sanctuary for a friend whose husband drank too much and beat her but remains responsible for raising and supporting 6 children. \r\nDolores started out her business with a little money from her father to buy material. But when someone stole everything she had, she started using credit to buy materials to jump start her business.

This ComUnidad is one of the oldest in Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\n<P>This group of women are requesting their 16th loan with the institution, despite the adversities that are presented to indigenous women in the rural areas of Guatemala. They have maintained themselves united for approximately 7 years, consolidating an unequaled friendship based on honesty and work ethic. The women of Xocomil are an example to Guatemalan society because they were one of the pioneers when they first applied for a loan almost a decade ago \u2013 a situation that had never occurred before.\r\n\r\n<P>Many of these women worked as housekeepers in wealthy homes in the capital city or in the homes of their relatives. Others grew up as weavers, lending their services to more developed businesses as cheap labor. These artisans also worked weaving their own products per individual requests, but in a very small scale. They earned enough to cover their living expenses, however, since they united with Friendship Bridge, their businesses have prospered and they have turned into successful businesswomen.\r\n\r\n<P>In ComUnidad Xocomil, one can find women that work in different economic sectors. For example, six of them weave beautiful huipiles (traditional indigenous Guatemalan dress); three of them work buying and selling traditional clothes such as skirts, aprons, sashes and blouses; three others sell breakfasts, lunches and dinners in the market and for house delivery; while another three cut up chickens and pigs and sell them in the market. One of them makes and sells tortillas in her own locale, while two others have a bakery.\r\n\r\n<P>The women will invest the loan in the purchase of thread for the production of huipiles and the purchase of chickens to quarter and sell in the market, while other women will buy blouses and aprons for their respective trade. The women that have a bakery will buy flour and utensils for the production of bread.\r\n\r\n<P>These women have been examples of the positive impact that microfinancing institutions have on the lives of women. Thanks to Friendship Bridge, they are full of hopes and dreams. Many of them aspire to purchase a plot of land to construct a house for their children or expand their small homes. They also hope that their children graduate from high school so that they do not have to experience what these women lived, an illiteracy that deprived them of many rights and advantages. The dreams of these women are consolidated with each loan and investment that they bring to their businesses and families. Help them maintain this hope.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>La ComUnidad Xocomil (ComUnidad es un t\u00e9rmino que utiliza Friendship Bridge para nombrar a los Bancos Comunales) est\u00e1 conformada por un grupo de mujeres alegres, emprendedoras, unidas y pioneras. Esta ComUnidad es una de las m\u00e1s antiguas en Friendship Bridge. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras est\u00e1n solicitando su 16to pr\u00e9stamo con la instituci\u00f3n, a pesar de las adversidades que se les presenta a mujeres ind\u00edgenas en las \u00e1reas rurales de Guatemala. Ellas se han mantenido unidas por aproximadamente 7 a\u00f1os consolidando una amistad inigualable que est\u00e1 basada en honestidad y trabajo. Las mujeres del Xocomil son un ejemplo a la sociedad Guatemalteca porque ellas fueron una de las pioneras al solicitar su cr\u00e9dito hace casi una d\u00e9cada. Una situaci\u00f3n que antes no suced\u00eda\r\n\r\n<P>Muchas de estas se\u00f1oras trabajaron como empleadas dom\u00e9sticas en casas de gente adinerada en la capital o en casa de sus parientes. Otras crecieron como tejedoras prestando sus servicios a empresarios m\u00e1s desarrollados como mano de obra barata. Tambi\u00e9n, las estas artesanas trabajaban tejiendo sus propios tejidos a pedidos individuales, pero en muy peque\u00f1a escala. Ellas ganaban lo suficiente para cubrir sus gastos de vida. Sin embargo, desde que se unieron a Friendship Bridge sus negocios han prosperado y se han vuelto en empresarias exitosas. \r\n\r\n<P>En la Comunidad Xocomil se puede encontrar a se\u00f1oras que trabajan en distintas \u00e1reas econ\u00f3micas. Por ejemplo, seis de ellas son tejedoras de hermosos huipiles (trajes tradicionales ind\u00edgenas Guatemaltecos); tres trabajan en la compra y venta de ropa tradicional como faldas, delantales, fajas y blusas; tres se\u00f1oras venden desayunos, almuerzos y cenas en el mercado y a domicilio; mientras que otras tres destazan pollos y cerdos y los venden en el mercado; una de ellas prepara y vende tortillas en su propio local y dos se\u00f1oras tienen una panader\u00eda. \r\n\r\n<P>El cr\u00e9dito va a ser invertido por las se\u00f1oras en la compra de hilo para la producci\u00f3n de huipiles, compra de pollos para destazarlos y venderlos en el mercado, otras se\u00f1oras van a usar el cr\u00e9dito para comprar blusas y delantales para su respectiva venta. Las se\u00f1oras que tienen una panader\u00eda van a comprar harina y utensilios para la producci\u00f3n de pan. \r\n\r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras han sido ejemplos del impacto positivo que tiene las microfinanzas en la vida de las mujeres.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":241130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing

They get their supplies from local producers and sell them at retail for cash or credit to a clientele consisting mainly of women.\r\nThe business allows the women of the Sinign\u00e8ssigui group to make an average profit of CFA 50,000\/month. With this they are able to repay the loan and meet some of the needs of their household (health, education, clothing, etc.).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":269725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various food items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yanfolila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.183333 -8.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":253062.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135828},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033627},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620995},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019960},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242705}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T04:32:02Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Llewellyn","image":44015}},{"id":92455,"name":"Joaquin Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJoaqu\u00edn Alberto M.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":350190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Veronica has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Veronica joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Veronica is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan Veronica has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Raquel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. The previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Raquel is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be Raquel's fourth loan from ASKI.

She sells new clothes for adults and children.  She has been in this field for four years.  She started by selling underwear.  She has currently incorporated different products, which is why her business is functioning favorably.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago, specifically in the Patronato and Barrio Meiggs sectors.  She has frequent customers, and she therefore needs to regularly restock her products.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy polar fleece pajamas, jeans, vests, underwear, hats, and coats specifically for the winter season.\r\n\r\nMelina says that her business is going very well, and it keeps her motivated.  Also, she really enjoys what she does.  Her business goals are to buy her own vehicle to transport her merchandise when she buys in the city of Santiago.  It takes a lot of sacrifice to use interurban busses for transport because of the quantity of products that she buys. \r\n\r\nMelina is head of the household, and she lives with her five children.  Three of them attend the university.  Therefore, she needs to continue with her business in order to get greater income and to pay for her children\u2019s university studies.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the support offered by Fondo Esperanza, for the ease of securing the loans, and for the priority they give to values.  They give priority mainly to confidence, respect, and the responsibility of paying back the loans.  \r\n\r\nLinares is an important urban center in the Maule region in the center of Chile. Agriculture is very important, and grapes for export are of increasing importance. Cereal crops (rice, wheat, maize, oats) and vegetables (beets, cabbage, lettuce, chard) and fruit grow well. Linares is the main producer of rice in Chile with 78% of national production coming from this province, especially from the community of Parral.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":774465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy polar fleece pajamas, jeans, vests, underwear, hats, and coats specifically for the winter season.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Linares","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":400802,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":23318},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":23540},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23763},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":23989},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24217},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":24064},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25025},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24913},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25149},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25388},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25629},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25873},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25974},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":26473},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":26616},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":26871}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.38},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":311.95,"local_amount":142891,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":145461.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502414},{"amount":219.35,"local_amount":100475,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":102282.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221666411},{"amount":285.04,"local_amount":130565,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":132913.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035268},{"amount":58.66,"local_amount":26871,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":27354.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795929}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T16:31:19Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":310466,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of 5 children, Maribel works hard to support her family.

Since she has a stand she will offer the clothing to relatives, friends, and acquaintances. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":930146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy clothing to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Comas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-11-26T05:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yrma Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eustolia Casilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizbeth Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Darwin Jahairo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irving Jimmy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jean Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brijith Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1560},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1560},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1560},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1560},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":580},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":580},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":580},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":580},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":580}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":580,"local_amount":1560,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250751424},{"amount":580,"local_amount":1560,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257158695},{"amount":580,"local_amount":1560,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263288863},{"amount":580,"local_amount":1560,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270010179},{"amount":580,"local_amount":1560,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276619266}],"funded_date":"2011-12-15T21:39:48Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:16:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":367868,"name":"Sothea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sothea, age 36, is a soldier and his wife, Sarom, age 34, is a garment worker.

<p>Barbarito B. is a farmer in the Santa Lucia County area. He owns a small plot of land where he lives with his wife, Maria, and their three children. Because he is from Santa Lucia, an area known for its rice cultivation, he has been growing rice his whole life. He also has experience with raising cows, which he owns a couple of. He hopes the loan he receives will help him in making his rice farming more efficient.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbarito is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>

I. \u00c1lfaro is a widow at the age of 57. She started her small store about four years ago at her husband's suggestion when he started to get sick. They knew that she needed a way to support herself when he was no longer able to provide for them. Now she has operated the store for four years, selling chips, noodles, sodas, dry goods, rice, beans, potatoes, and tamales. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nBefore she got credit from Friendship Bridge, she had to rely on her suppliers for credit, which significantly increased the cost of her goods. Now she's in her third loan cycle, and will use the credit to continue growing her inventory.  Her next goal is to buy a larger refrigerator so that she can start to offer chicken and other meats for sale. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nGenoveva has two grandchildren who live with her.

Saat ini I Wayan Badra merencanakan akan menanam bibit padi jenis unggul agar kwalitas beras yang dihasilkan lebih baik dan biaya perawatan bisa ditekan karena bibit padi jenis unggul lebih tahan terhadap penyakit.

He leads a group of 10 people, which is called Betania 1a Group. He lives in Nekmese - Naet, Kupang District, East Nusa Tenggara Province in Indonesia. The income source of the community in Nekmese Naet village is the agricultural sector. To earn money, Apner usually sells bananas, cucumbers, vegetables, cassavas, corns and coconuts in the traditional market as well as the markets in Kupang City, but he feels that the income that he earns is not enough to meet his family needs. Apner is a married man and has 4 children who are: Ricki N. 15 years old - in Junior High School Grade 3; Frengki N. 13 years old - in Elementary School Grade 6; Nonci N. 11 years old who has suffered from deafness since she was born. Apner can not send her to school because there is no school for deaf people in this village. And the last one is Reni N. 5 years old \u2013 who studies in the Kindergarten.\r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Apner wants to improve his income by running another business. He is interested in the cattle fattening program because it can generate a large profit. Apner is requesting Rp. 3,300,000 to buy cattle to be fattened. The same as Apner, the other group members are also requesting loans from TLM to buy cattle to be fattened over the 12 month period. They will repay the initial cost of the cattle and get the profit after selling the cattle. \r\n\r\nNote: The group picture was taken separately because 4 members of this group are involved in building the church in their village. Yurita also wasn't present when the group picture was taken, so her husband replaced her in the group picture."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":291061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T06:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apner","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifasius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maklon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frengki","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yurita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Zet","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Misraim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorensius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":32800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":32800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":553.35,"local_amount":6600000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6626306.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136755431},{"amount":2196.65,"local_amount":26200000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T10:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26304428.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188364}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T23:04:36Z","paid_date":"2010-10-30T10:31:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":100663,"name":"Muibat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muibat A. is 50 years old and married with 4 children.

As a result of her hard work and actively saving, she has been able to buy cows that also provide her with milk to sell, hence increasing her daily income. She sells the eggs to her customers in Kayunga and Jinja and, like the broilers, for meat. She is also a farmer, but on a smaller scale.

She started this business 14 years ago with her own money and later took advantage of loans from AFODENIC to increase her inventory and therefore also her sales. This business contributes a lot to help pay for daily expenses and the needs of her family. Maria's husband is a musician who plays traditional Andean music, and they have two children, a 3-year-old and a 17-year-old who attends secondary school. This loan would be the sixth that she has invested in the purchase of various articles of clothing, shoes and cosmetics. Maria sells her items for cash, and also offers a 2-week long financing option. With this loan, she hopes to increase her sales. Maria is very grateful for the opportunity this institution as given her to increase her inventory.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva

She is 28 years old. Everlyn is married and has 3 infants. Everlyn's main source of income comes from operating a clothing business. Everlyn has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Everlyn joined GDMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Everlyn is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase more ready made clothing for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Everlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The main source of income for her business comes primarily from selling vegetable such as squash, sayote, cabbage, and other vegetables in the local community. Tessie has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tessie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tessie is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Tessie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

E. is from the Condega municipality.  He will use the loan to buy school supplies and to enroll his children.  He is asking for the loan because he does not have all the money to do so now.  He wants to enroll his children so that they do not have any difficulty starting the school year.  He will also take part of the money so that his wife can work in her business selling basic grains.  His wife works selling potatoes in a van.\r\n\r\nPedro is a workman for the Catholic Agricultural University of Tr\u00f3pico Seco (UCATSE).  He has worked as a security guard for the university for over six years.  He has done this type of work all of his life.  He expects that the loan will be of much use; it will resolve his personal problems.\r\n\r\nPedro is married and has four school-age children in his care.  They go to school and are currently in the primary grades.  His parents do not live with him, but he continues to look after them.\r\n\r\nThis is Pedro\u2019s first loan.  He says that he will remain grateful to Ceprodel for the help they are offering him.  It will help him solve the problems he now has.  It is the first time that he has contracted a debt, and he expects to do well in order to keep working and not mar his credit record.  That way he will make a good impression with Ceprodel, and they will continue taking care of him in the same manner in the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
