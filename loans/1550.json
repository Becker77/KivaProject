I want to change this.\u201d\n\nThanks to his work history, Patrick understand what it takes to maintain a business and is currently in the initial stages of raising funds to make his dream come true.  \u201cThe largest obstacle I\u2019ve faced has been trying to figure out how to come up with the capital to start the business.\u201d\n\nOver the past three months, Patrick has been purchasing some of the equipment he needs for woodwork.  However, he\u2019s still missing some of the  most important tools, and these cost a lot of money to ship because of their fragility. Shipping can set Patrick back upwards of $500.00.  \n\nThe loan that Patrick is requesting will go to covering the costs of tools, wood and shipping.  Patrick needs this working capital to launch his business, and slowly transition from managing other people\u2019s businesses, to taking care of his own.

For Rosa, visiting family was a normal thing, \r\nuntil the day when she had the idea to make the most of the town where her family lives to sell clothing. Now, at 63 years old, she has a large number of customers, she has expanded to the entire department of her country. She is the mother of 12 children, between the ages of 44 and 20 years old, and has worked selling clothing and cosmetics under the sun for over 25 years, with the goal to bring her family ahead.\r\n\r\nRosa is married to a man who has always supported her with the income from a mini-disco that he has.  Together, they have managed to offer food, a stable roof, and education to their children. However, she always wanted to expand to other places, for which she asks for a loan to purchase shirts, jeans, skirts, cosmetics, and lingerie to always have the merchandise that her customers like, and in this way increase her sales. In the future, she plans to sell shoes to attract more customers.

As such, Nurali is the only breadwinner in the family.  He operates a car wash out of his backyard, and has done so for the past 5 years.  He has three people working under him, and together, they wash an average of 28 cars a day.\r\n\r\nNurali is driven to succeed, and wants to expand his business accordingly.  He is seeking a loan of $5000 USD to buy high-quality steam and vacuum cleaners made by Karcher for his car wash.

She earns 150.000 IDR profit per piglet. The advantage is that she could save to expand the business. She hopes that MUK will always accompany the group until all members can be independent.\r\n\r\nTo continue the effort and increase the number of pigs, the Sumber Tanjung group went to the next loan, for the same amount as the previous loan. These loans were used to purchase piglets, especially a superior species. Pig breeding businesses can help increase their family incomes because of easy maintenance and can be used as additional work.

Shelly says that in the business of mobile money transfers, money is always moving and as such the more customers you have, the more money you need to satisfy them. \r\n\r\nShelly's new shop sees a lot of customers coming and going. This has the potential to give Shelly a lot of customers, but unfortunately she does not have a big enough working capital float to satisfy them all. With her Kiva loan she hopes to never have to turn away a customer. \r\n\r\nShelly lives in Lusaka with her mother and four siblings.

Meet Elizah, an ever-smiling young farmer from Kapsowar County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture - that it\u2019s only meant for the older generation. Elizah has been doing mixed farming for the past five years and through those years she has gathered so much experience with the techniques of farming. Through the income from farming she has been able to take care of her family and also provide the basic needs for her children. \r\n\r\nElizah is a very enterprising woman, and although she never got formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her family of a decent meal. The Kapsowar area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. Being a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Elizah feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. Eliza is much disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits she will be able to improve her living conditions and also secure the future of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1697742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

His other 5 children now have their own families. He works hard every day to support his family. Mario never had the opportunity to study: his father was an alcoholic and Mario had to work in order to support his mother and his siblings. The children who live with Mario now are all studying at the local school. \r\n\r\nMario has worked since the age of 10 as a day labourer, a bricklayer's assistant and he also worked, for a long time, washing buses. When he got married at the age of 18, he learned how to make artisanal crafts, sleeping mats, and padded tule reed rings. He also sells scrap metal, plastic and rope. He says that it was his mother who taught him the importance of fighting to get ahead and not to be afraid of selling the scrap metal and plastic which he collects from the streets in his community.   \r\n\r\nMario travels to the capital city three days a week in order to sell his products. When he is not travelling, he makes the crafts and products, with the help of his children and his wife, and he also grows maize and beans so that his family has their daily staple food.  \r\n\r\nThe loan, which Mario is asking for from CREDICAMPO, is to buy tule reeds, which he needs to go and find in neighbouring municipalities as they are very scarce, and to buy fertiliser. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mario plans to improve his home. He says that his father sold all the land that had belonged to the family and so they had to rent for a long time. Thanks to Mario's savings, however, he managed to buy some land and build a house, and he now plans to improve the roof. He also wants to continue helping his children to study so that one day they will be professionals. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1693451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy tule reeds, which he needs to go and find in neighbouring municipalities as they are very scarce, and to buy fertiliser.

She is seated between the two young women, wearing a grey sweater with big buttons. Her job has been selling shoes for 25 years. She works alone because she can pay for her younger children's school expenses and help her oldest daughter with her college expenses. She does her selling as a street vendor in the markets of her city and in neighboring cities. Every day she transports boxes and bags full of shoes to her different points of sale, working the whole day long to return home at night. Her dream is to have a permanent sales spot so that she doesn't have to transport her merchandise anymore. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Elizabeth is asking for a loan to buy shoes wholesale.

Her primary income sources are milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nEunice\u2019s agribusiness has been profitable for 5 years. She is very contented with farming not only as an economic activity but also as a lifestyle. Today she is seeking a loan to purchase poultry in order to expand her business.\r\n \r\nWith your loan, Eunice will make enough income from the loan investment to repay the loan and better her living.

Meet Christine, one of the most hardworking women on earth. She is 42 years of age, very hardworking and a go-getter. She is a proud mother of four lovely children. She hails from Koplolo, a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin, but Christine has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past five years. \r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. Christine passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cTuyai\u201d (this is from a person\u2019s name), and whenever she is milking her cow, she feels proud. She is contented with the farming way of life. \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge in farming is irrigating her farm. She is requesting a loan to buy a generator that she will use in pumping water from the river to her farm. Irrigation is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and re-vegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall.

She has been working in this area for two years, and decided to pursue this line of work because in her community, no one else worked selling gifts. For her, this generates good earnings in order to sustain her family, and has improved her family's living conditions. She also works buying and selling typical clothing. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy raw materials in order to sell gifts by stocking her merchandise, to have more products available to her customers who require them. One of Evangelina's aspirations is to see her children become professionals, and to build houses for her sons so that they might have adequate living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1695575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for her sale of gifts.

This group consists of eight members and is led by a Board of Directors in which Sra. Lourdes is the president.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as operating a family boarding house, selling liquor, selling shawls, knitting baby clothes, selling fried foods, selling sweatshirts, managing a neighborhood store, and operating a butcher shop.  <br \/><br \/>This loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Lourdes.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer two years ago after receiving an invitation from a friend who is also a client of the organization.  Lourdes currently has a business of preparing and selling food.  She had previous knowledge about this type of business since she used to work at one that was owned by a relative.  When she obtained a small amount of capital, she decided to become independent.  <br \/><br \/>The loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying rice and potatoes in bulk.  She acquires her supplies from the wholesale vendors at the fairs in the city of El Alto and uses them to prepare the food that she sells from her vending space.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income for supporting her family.  Lourdes is in a common-law relationship and has three children.  <br \/><br \/>When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Lourdes said that she enjoys the training seminars that are offered by the organization and being able to share with her fellow group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":1694725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice and potatoes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-09-26T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-26T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melissa Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Ricarda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Licia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2490.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2767.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2842},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2919.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2999.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3080.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3165.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3503.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":361.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":401.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":423.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":508.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":763.18,"local_amount":5257.8,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5273.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561656105},{"amount":412.53,"local_amount":2842,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579575091},{"amount":423.82,"local_amount":2919.84,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2928.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168917},{"amount":435.37,"local_amount":2999.36,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3008.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612173895},{"amount":447.19,"local_amount":3080.84,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3089.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624239122},{"amount":459.43,"local_amount":3165.12,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3174.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636606885},{"amount":508.48,"local_amount":3503.04,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-23T12:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3513.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650950159}],"funded_date":"2014-10-21T23:45:00Z","paid_date":"2015-05-23T12:11:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":771165,"name":"Bertha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Bertha se sigue dedicando al negocio de venta de productos de belleza, la socia vende l\u00e1piz labiales, cremas y perfumes,por medio de este negocio la socia quiere salir adelante,  el sue\u00f1o de la socia es tener un local donde pueda vender los productos de belleza.

She keeps a few sheep that provide her with home grown meat and wool. However, the sheep milk market is not open in Kenya. For this reason, Annah is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow and insure it. The cow will produce milk that will be used for consumption and sales.

He lacks funds to increase his poultry farming, so he is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being from a marginalized community, he finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, he feels relieved knowing that his dream will be achieved, and he will be able to buy more poultry. With the loan, he will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to his neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary man, he intends to accumulate more profits and expand his poultry business to other markets. This will increase his income and improve his living conditions. The extra income he will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan, permanently changing his living conditions, and securing the future of his school-going

She has been in this business for many years already.  \r\n\r\nSince she wants to be more productive, Jubelyn has now decided to expand her resources, purchasing fish in bulk for resale at the market. In May, 2013 Jubelyn joined Paglaum MPC to access financial assistance for her project. She has now applied for a loan of 12,000 PHP to buy more fish for resale. She is hoping that with Paglaum\u2019s help, and with the moral support of her family, she can look forward to being a successful vendor someday and to owning a stall in the public market.

Luka, being a responsible man who cherishes his family, would want to see his family grow economically and to have an impact on society. He wants to increase his farming business and is seeking a loan of 26,875 KES. He will use the loan to buy a dairy cow, which would in turn, increase his milk production. The cow dung from the animal will be used as fertilizer for his small  garden, where he grows vegetables to sell and for home consumption. Luka is very comfortable with the repayment period and monthly installments, and his projections are that he will be able to repay the loan even before the due date. Through the loan, Luka would be able to sell milk to his neighbors and also to the nearby villages, generating much profit. This would result in better living conditions for his family. Lukas\u2019 target and dream is to open a milk processing plant once he has accumulated more

Founded by European settlers in the early 1900s, Kitale originally grew due to its proximity to the Ugandan railway. The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping.

She has four children: a 20-year-old daughter, and three sons ages 18, 16 and 15.  Her daughter is a student, her oldest son works in a store, and the other two sons are still in grade school.  Fayzimo herself works as a seamstress, and has done so for the past 15 years.  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Fayzimo is in great need of a loan as she has yet to pay for her daughter's 4-year college studies.  Her daughter, Fariza, is studying at the Tajik Technical University as an economics major.  If her tuition isn't paid this year, her daughter will have to drop out.  As such, Fayzimo is seeking a loan of $2600 USD to help pay for her daughter's education.  This loan is crucial to Fayzimo; $2300 will go towards paying her daughter's tuition, while the remaining $300 will be used to buy school supplies. \r\n

Kiva lenders! Meet Titus, who has been religiously farming on his half-acre piece of land for the past 3 years. He is happily married, and he and his \u201cheart beat\u201d (his wife) are blessed with 4 lovely children. Titus' upbringing was very challenging, and he never got all the basic needs that he desired, but he promised himself that he would work extra hard to improve his living conditions and also improve the living conditions for his parents.\r\n\r\nTitus' primary source of income is crop and dairy farming, and through these occupations he has been able to earn an honest income. Titus passionately loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \"Lelmelet.\"\r\n\r\nTitus has a large space of land on his farm, so he wants to increase the number of his dairy cows. However, because he is a small-scale farmer, one challenge he faces is accessing funds.

Her three sons are day labourers. \r\n\r\nHowever, the low income is not enough to meet the basic needs of their family. Jaheda and her husband, 54-year-old Mosareph, are involved in farming as well. This is an important source of income for them. They grow vegetables and sell the produce in the local market. Thus, they can somehow manage the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAs life gets more expensive day by day, Jaheda and her husband want to grow their income. They want to cultivate bottle gourds, which are a popular vegetable to the people of their region. A loan will help them to purchase seeds and fertilizer for bottle gourd cultivation.\r\n\r\nJaheda is seeking a loan to run their agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that they will be able to cover the household expenses. So, Jaheda has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and BJS. She wants to give her best to have a successful and profitable business with which they can upgrade their living standard.

Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, they have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. \r\n\r\nJack is the father of eight children, and both he and his wife have been farming for five years now. They are currently growing maize, beans, cassava and sunflower. \r\n\r\nAlthough beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. Jack is excited about beekeeping, as it will provide him with honey for food and medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Honey Care, and Jack plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and to expand his beekeeping project.

The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping.

Margaret is excited about beekeeping, as the bees will help in pollinating their crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Margaret's first loan with Honey Care.
