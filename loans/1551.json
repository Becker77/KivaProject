good to know that there are still people who are dedicated to looking after the environment as a productive activity. This is what Domingo does and ever since he was little he has had this desire to farm in his community. Now he is 50 years old and has two children. The first is 9 years old and studies at the local school and the second is 2 years old and does not study yet.  \r\n\r\nDomingo's occupation since he was 21 years old has been the cultivation of coffee. He learned his trade from his parents - the only legacy that they left him. For this reason he has been working in the fields which belonged to his parents in order to earn an income and ensure the upkeep of his family. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the loan that Domingo is requesting is to buy land that is being offered to him. He has been trying to buy this land for some time as he wishes to leave something nice for his children so that they can have what they need to live adequately. \r\n\r\nDomingo wants to be different to his parents. One of his greatest aspirations for the future is to build homes for his children so that they can have adequate living conditions and to provide them with education so that they can be professionals

With her greatest care, Beatriz offers items to the consumers in her neighborhood that they cannot find in other nearby places, and she offers the best prices because she purchases wholesale directly from wholesalers. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Beatriz has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan, the first financing that she has requested from this organization. Through this she will purchase miscellaneous articles such as feminine accessories, little gifts for the home, and stationery, among other merchandise to impact her sales and to make her Kiva loan a successful investment because it will improve her business\u2019s conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1695779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to purchase miscellaneous items such as feminine accessories, little gifts for the home, and stationery, among other merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-09-27T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-27T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":70.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":47647},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":47765},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":49079},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50429},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":51815},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":53240},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":54704},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":56209},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57754},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":59343},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":60975},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":61040}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.66,"local_amount":47647,"processed_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-10-17T13:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50662.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":542518341},{"amount":25.72,"local_amount":47765,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50788.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562430984},{"amount":21.46,"local_amount":44512,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":47329.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.51,"payment_id":595164222},{"amount":15.52,"local_amount":35420,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":37661.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.55,"payment_id":624849336},{"amount":34.85,"local_amount":71216,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":75723.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.5,"payment_id":649571642},{"amount":155.95,"local_amount":403440,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":428974.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.28,"payment_id":711475194}],"funded_date":"2014-09-28T21:40:37Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:45:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":772770,"name":"Henry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Henry is a Taxi driver from the Mbarara district.

With PHP 50,000, she could already purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nLeus hopes to give her children a better future by providing them good and quality education. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He has a wife and four children, and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops and a personal business. He has been practicing farming for the past 15 years. Having been farming for such a long time, he has gained much experience and he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nDemand for dairy milk has been high and Benson wants to take advantage of the market; therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya, and Benson has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. Benson always says that \u201cto become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d He has planted so many trees on his farm that dairy food will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan he will not only benefit from milk but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used to improve the fertility of his farm, saving money that would have been spent in buying fertilizer. \r\n\r\nBenson has been facing challenges in accessing finances but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Benson chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Benson underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through accumulated profits, he plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-age children by paying tuition fees for them. He thinks that with increased income he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester and, hence, save costs incurred in buying fuel.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1698487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She works from 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every working day and is able to realize a fair monthly income.\r\n\r\nThis is Lilian's 18th credit cycle from Tujijenge Tanzania; she has paid back all of the previous loans successfully. Lilian used the previous credit to increase her number of chicks: layers from 200 to 300 and broilers from 400 to 800 current. She also used it to buy chicken feeds and vaccinations. With a good job, she has earned extra income, which she has used to pay school fees and part of home food expenses. She is so thankful for Kiva's support and believes it will keep on supporting her family and business. \r\n\r\nLilian will use her 18th cycle to buy 200 layers for her poultry business. Lilian will share this loan with her loan group, \"Amsterdam\", which consists of two members, who will be accountable to pay back the loan.

It is important that her tricycle is always in good running condition to ensure its continuous service. Their income from their service is a good source to support their daily needs and for the schooling of her children.

Meet Reuben, 25 years old, who is a native of the village of Kongyalil in the Kapsowar area of Kenya where he lives with his parents.  His upbringing was challenging and he never went to college so that he could secure a formal job, but he did not surrender to that and has been practicing farming for the past three years. \r\n\r\nThrough farming, he has been able to take care of his family. His main source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming, and through these ventures, he has supported his family because he is the only breadwinner. Reuben passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of his animals \u201cBrown,\u201d which is an English word depicting the color of the cow. \r\n\r\nReuben stated that the most enjoyable bit about farming is \u201cit gives me personal fulfillment and feeds my family.\" Although he has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. He has been facing challenges transporting his produce from the farm to the market. That is why he is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. \r\n\r\nThe Kapsowar area is a rural town and roads are very poor and transporting goods for Reuben has always been a \u201cnightmare\u201d. He has been suffering losses because goods reach the market when they are not fresh, hence fetching a low price. Vegetables and milk are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and through the loan, he will be able to achieve his dream. \r\n\r\nHe plans to employ someone who will be helping him in farm work and transporting the produce to the market, hence impacting the society positively through creation of employment. Increased profits from the loan will allow him to repay the loan fully and be able to permanently change his living conditions and assure his aging parents of a secure future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1698510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-27T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-27T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":186.69,"local_amount":16179.42,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":16531,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194283},{"amount":198.29,"local_amount":17185.52,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":17558.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264236},{"amount":349.93,"local_amount":31635.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":32322.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.09,"payment_id":681377285}],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T14:57:49Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":773272,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is 28 years old, married and the father of four children.

Benjamin has one child whom he adores and cherishes, and a beautiful wife who always paints a smile on Benjamin\u2019s face. \r\n\r\nBenjamin has been practicing mixed farming for the past six years and is making great strides. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living through milk and egg selling and personal business. These ventures have enabled him to send his child to school and feed his family. Benjamin has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow, thereby enhancing his milk-selling profits. \r\n\r\nBecause of increased demand, Benjamin is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Benjamin is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. \r\n\r\nThrough increased profits, Benjamin is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. Benjamin, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo, through its training, has helped Benjamin save more effectively, and through his accumulated profits, he plans to add value to his milk through packaging. He also hopes to one day start manufacturing milk products such as yoghurt and cream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1698528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-27T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-27T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2334.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2402.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2473.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2545.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2619.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2856.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2939.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3025.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3113.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.58,"local_amount":3639.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3770.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625162},{"amount":27.46,"local_amount":2347.16,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2431.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194284},{"amount":38.78,"local_amount":3314.47,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3434.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823608},{"amount":263.8,"local_amount":22545.96,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":23359.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262138},{"amount":2.27,"local_amount":203.17,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":210.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":752110481}],"funded_date":"2014-09-29T00:04:16Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":773274,"name":"Hilaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hilaria is from Taguilon Dapitan City in Zamboanga del Norte.

is 43, married, and the mother of two school-aged children.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and has been a crop and livestock farmer for the past 18 years.  Her farm currently has four dairy cows, five sheep, and a 1.60-hectare plot of land where she grows potatoes, grain, and sainfoin using only natural fertilizers and manual labor.  She sells her harvest both to wholesalers and retailers, as well as flavorful organic milk, which is one of her more popular products.

Evans","image":null}},{"id":773297,"name":"Stanley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Listening to Stanley referring to the different breeds of dairy cows on his compound, one would mistake him for an Agricultural Extension Officer. Stanley, from Kapsowar, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer of his locality. He has a wife and two children and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops and personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 5 years. Having done farming for such a long time he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Maasai tribe (Stanley\u2019s tribe) - where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Stanley wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Stanley has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. Stanley always says that, \u201cto become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d \r\n\r\nHe has planted so many trees on his farm and dairy food will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan, Stanley will not only benefit from milk but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. \r\n\r\nStanley has been facing challenges in accessing finances but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Stanley chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Stanley underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and during the training season, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. \r\n\r\nThrough accumulated profits Stanley plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them.

in Kongyalil, a rural village in Kapsowar. He has no family, has been practicing farming for the past two years, and has never looked back. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. \r\n\r\nMost of the small holder farmers in Kongyalil village own approximately half an acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Oscar has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. Kongyalil village is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition; this has hampered Oscar from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Oscar sells vegetables, milk and tomatoes which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price. \r\n\r\nOscar is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely way so he can overcome the challenge of facing losses. Through the loan he will deliver the products timely to the market and this means he will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. Oscar plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan fully and invest in a solid foundation for his family to

married with two school-aged children who help around the home. She has a high school education and has been working in agriculture and animal husbandry since 2009. In addition, she and her husband built a banya (Russian-style sauna) for use by local residents. Aida currently has 20 sheep, one milking cow, five calves and 200 bales of prepared hay as well as a piece of land where she grows wheat, potatoes and hay. Aida sells about five litres of milk every day, and these profits have allowed her to breed her livestock and improve her family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Anna has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 80,000 KGS to buy construction materials so she can build a barn for her livestock. She has decided to build a barn since this winter is supposed to be a cold one and she has nowhere to keep the animals. She plans to put profits from the loan into further increasing her number of livestock and into home repairs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1696997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials so she can build a barn for her livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chelpek village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-09-27T20:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-27T20:00:04Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11771},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":12737},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":13108},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":13491},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":13884},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":220.71,"local_amount":11771,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11920.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578629},{"amount":238.82,"local_amount":12737,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":12898.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489260},{"amount":243.78,"local_amount":13108,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":13274.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.99,"payment_id":595436446},{"amount":247.72,"local_amount":13491,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":13662.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.24,"payment_id":610751431},{"amount":251.22,"local_amount":13884,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":14060.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.1,"payment_id":624799146},{"amount":262.03,"local_amount":15009,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15199.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.39,"payment_id":636161272}],"funded_date":"2014-10-02T05:01:12Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":773308,"name":"Alfred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alfred is a 32-year-old male living with two children aged two and five.

The people from this place are very hard working; the majority of the people run a business from their homes, while some others go to sell in other areas. Also, the place is characterized by the harvest of prickly pears, since from the beginning they were able to take advantage of the large greenhouses of prickly pears. The sister of Pascual, one of the current members, chose the name of the group because she likes the flowers. At present, the group includes five people.\r\n\r\nRosa, who belongs to the group, is 28 years old and lives in a common-law marriage with Abel. For four years, they have been a family with their twins, who still don\u2019t attend school. Rosa has been raising and fattening calves for two years. She says that this business is very easy, but that above all she loves it because she it allows her to be with her children and, at the same time, to help with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nRosa needs a loan to buy more food, ground grass, and corn for the animals she has in her home. Everyday, starting at 5am, Rosa wakes up to begin her work. It takes about one hour to feed the three oxen. She knows that she should care for her animals very well, since the larger and healthier they are, the better her earnings will be. Her husband was the one that started the activity. He was taking care of the animals, but after he was offered a job in their community, they decided that she would continue raising the animals. Rosa loves having more animals, since it is an advantage for her to sell an animal before some unexpected event, especially in cases related to her children\u2019s health, which worries Rosa most. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Eleuteria, who will invest in silver jewelry and gold sheets; Modesto and Magdaleno, who will invest in fruits and vegetables; and Pascual, who will invest in imitation and novelty items.

Meet Salina, 49 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer who is based in Kiptere, a remote village in Kericho. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture. \r\n\r\nSalina is happily married and blessed with eight children. For the past 23 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Kericho area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. Salina is a member of Tembwet digital self-help group, and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently. Profits from the loan will be used in repaying the loan and increasing her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1698604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has a specialist-high school education and since 2008 has been making pelmeni (meat dumplings) and bread in a workshop attached to her home as the primary source of income for her family. With the help of eight employees she packs the pelmeni and sells an average of 100 kg of them daily as well as 50 loaves of bread. She also takes orders for packaged cooked beans.

She maintains the status of being a member in good standing and repays her obligations in a timely manner.<br \/><br \/>Recently, Perla is asking for financial assistance in the amount of PHP 5,000 to buy additional raw ingredients for Suman-making and to buy materials and equipment used for cooking. Through this, she hopes to increase her income and to expand her business.  She has found assistance for her financial needs through Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative and she is very thankful with all her

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. Originally dominated by English settlers in the early 20th century, the region\u2019s farmland was redistributed after independence. This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. The lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\r\n\r\nWilson is married and has nine children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for 45 years now and they are currently growing maize, beans, bananas and wood rock, and they also keep livestock. Wilson is excited about beekeeping as it will earn him some income from the sale of honey and provide him with honey for medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is Wilson's first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to invest in his farm.

He works hard to augment their income to provide for their everyday living expenses and to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nFederico has a tricycle unit which he himself drives.  In the Philippines, especially in provinces like Silang, the tricycle is the most common means of transportation.  People ride a tricycle to go to market, church, friends, city hall, and other destinations.  Buses are limited and do not normally pass by the town areas.  It is very important that his tricycle unit is always in a good running condition to ensure continuous service and income.\r\n\r\nFederico is requesting for a PHP 10,000 loan assistance to buy spare parts for a good maintenance of his tricycle unit.  His income from his transportation business helps a lot in meeting his family's daily needs and for the schooling of his children.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he plans to buy another unit of tricycle to improve his income and better provide for his family. He dreams for his children to go to a good school.  He values family and unity. He meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Asya is 58 and a widow with four children. She has a specialist high school education and has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture since 1999. All her children except the youngest son live on their own, but they help their mother actively. Asya currently has two cows, 10 sheep and two horses as well as a 1.45 hectare piece of land on which she grows wheat and barley, and another 0.3 hectares where she has a pear orchard. \r\n\r\nRevenue from her business doesn't come close to covering her living costs, so Asya's children help her financially, but she wants her business to help her live independently from her children and, in turn, help them. Therefore, with the goal of further developing her business, Asya has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy three steers. The profits will help Asya improve her quality of life and save toward her youngest son's wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1697010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase three steers for fattening and resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ananievo village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-09-28T00:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-28T00:40:04Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5665},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5749},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5892},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6040},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6191},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6345},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6504},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6667},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6833},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7004},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":7110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":5665,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561578630},{"amount":106.77,"local_amount":5749,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5766.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489261},{"amount":108.54,"local_amount":5892,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5909.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":595436447},{"amount":109.85,"local_amount":6040,"processed_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6058.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.32,"payment_id":610751432},{"amount":110.96,"local_amount":6191,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6209.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.02,"payment_id":624799147},{"amount":699.67,"local_amount":40463,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":40586.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":51.78,"payment_id":636161274}],"funded_date":"2014-10-07T14:53:29Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":773399,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is a married woman with two children.

Meet Johnstone, a 36-year-old farmer from Siongiroi, which is a small, rural town in the Rift valley of Kenya. \r\n\r\nThis father of one is interested in many farming activities. Currently, he is doing dairy farming, tea farming, and horticulture. He has put the last four years of her life into agriculture. He loves it. His main sources of income are milk and tea. He makes extra money on the side through venturing into other personal businesses. \r\n\r\nHe is very appreciative of the fact that farming has sustainable returns! This enables him to enjoy profits and expand. Johnstone is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter, which is a mechanical device that he will use in cutting straw or hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage to feed his cows. \r\n\r\nJohnstone has been having problems feeding his cow and most of the time his cows refuse to eat but through this loan, the chaff cutter will aid the animal's digestion and prevent the cows from rejecting any part of the food. Through proper feeding, his cows will produce more milk and hence increase income through selling milk. \r\n\r\nJohnstone believes the key to increased milk production is proper health. A dairy cow needs roughage and protein in their diet to be healthy. A healthy cow is more productive, and that means more income for the owner.
