Meet Jeremiah who is a practicing dairy farmer in Siongiroi area of Kenya. Agriculture is his family occupation and also the primary source of income for his family. He owns half an acre of land in the village and cultivates vegetables and maize. He has always been proud to call himself a farmer and now, he is even more proud to call himself a dairy farmer. He is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge he has on farming, he commands a lot of respect from other farmers in his village. Dairy farming is close to his heart and every day he wakes up to milk his cow and that makes him very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough he makes profits through milk selling, he lacks a proper dairy unit and he is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan he will have an easier time milking his cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \r\n\r\nJeremiah believes that through this loan his living conditions will change because he is going to have an increase in milk production. He will save money that he used to spend on treating his cows because he lacked a good dairy unit. Jeremiah waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":409.26,"image":{"id":1698826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-09-28T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-28T12:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":3333.61,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3334.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194290},{"amount":32.54,"local_amount":2892.71,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2893.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823614},{"amount":33.9,"local_amount":3012.96,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3013.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262142},{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":3101.02,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3101.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264242},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":3056.92,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3057.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600430},{"amount":69.53,"local_amount":6421.47,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6422.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.71,"payment_id":681377290},{"amount":38.06,"local_amount":3539.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3539.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.76,"payment_id":696587060},{"amount":37.3,"local_amount":3572.09,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3572.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.89,"payment_id":711505314},{"amount":39.64,"local_amount":3719.62,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3720.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.21,"payment_id":731022176},{"amount":40,"local_amount":3727.91,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3728.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.94,"payment_id":752110484}],"funded_date":"2014-10-05T14:06:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":771986,"name":"Paulina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSAN MARTIN DE ZURITE\u201d;

The group consists of eight members led by a Chairwoman, Se\u00f1ora Karla. The members run various businesses such as making mattresses, food sales, cosmetics sales, textile sales, machine-made textiles, appliance repair, and furniture sales. The group will obtain a loan to help their small businesses, including Se\u00f1ora Karla's.   \r\n \r\nSe\u00f1ora Karla joined Pro Mujer two years ago at the invitation of a friend who was a Pro Mujer client. Se\u00f1ora Karla currently runs a business selling electronic appliances; she started the business with her partner, whose family also sold appliances and taught Karla the business. This business has allowed Se\u00f1ora Karla to support herself, her partner, and their two children.  Se\u00f1ora Karla will take out a loan to increase business capital that she'll use for the purchase of wholesale electronic appliances in El Alto. She'll then sell these products in her store. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Karla observes that she's pleased that Pro Mujer offers training and enjoys the camaraderie that she has with the other group members.

She currently has one milking cow, five sheep, four lambs and one horse, as well as 1.435 hectares of arable land where she grows hay and potatoes.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Beishekan sells about 10 litres of organic milk, which is in high demand among the local residents who are her customers. Her total income is about 8,000 KGS per month; however, this doesn't come close to what she needs to cover her living costs, and therefore she has decided to develop her business. For this reason she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 40,000 KGS to purchase a dairy cow.

She manages her family's affairs by selling fried fish. She has been in this business for six years now. Amina obtains stock from the big city market where there is plenty of fish. To do so she travels for about five hours (coming and going). Amina wakes up early in the morning at 4 am to begin her work day. After returning home, she fries the fish and then sells her product until about 9 pm. She does this daily. Amina enjoys a good monthly profit from her business. \r\n\r\nAmina is from Tujijenge, Tanzania. This is her tenth loan request and she will use it to buy fish and frying oil. With her previous loans, which she has since repaid successfully, she improved her fish business by buying satisfactory fish stock and buckets of frying oil. Also, she managed her business well and received extra income which she used to build the house she is living in now. Amina is happy with her house and thanks Kiva for the support. She is also able to pay school fees and household expenses. Her dream is to grow her business more and be better off in life. She will share this loan with her loan group \"RANGE\" which consists of two members. The group members will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

She earns 15,000 to 20,000 som (KGS) per month. Aychurok is saving money to invest in the development and expansion of her business. However, she also needs to improve her family\u2019s living conditions, so she began building her own house. She has completed about 60% of the work but does not have enough money to finish building. This is why she applied for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to buy cement, paint, insulation, and other materials.

Meet Andrea, aged 51, who lives in lolminingai, a remote village in the Nandi hills area of Kenya. Nandi hills area is an area where hard-core poverty pervades every homestead, but Andrea has shown resilience and has been toiling on his farm for the past 34 years. Because of the immense knowledge he has on farming, he is regarded as a mentor to upcoming farmers. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business that he engages in to the make ends meet. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. Andrea passionately loves dairy farming and as he likes to put it, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart.\u201d He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow, but to buy a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence, improved living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan, and also towards the education of his children.

Three of them live in a community that is surrounded by sugar cane plantations and in the rainy season the lagoon sometimes fills up and they can no longer pass on the roads, and must take alternate routes. The locality is 100% sugar cane, although there are also some lime stones that are taken to the quarry one hour away from the community to be processed and thus obtain lime.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are:\r\nEfigenia - sells fertilizers \r\nTeresa - sells fertilizers \r\nJes\u00f9s - sells fertilizers \r\n\r\nAnd Jose Antonio who is 43 years old and married to Griselda, who works as a seamstress and can sew anything from a pair of shorts to a wedding dress. The two of them live alone since they don't have children. Jose Antonio is better known as \u201cTo\u00f1o\u201d or \u201cTornado\u201d, and has been working as a taxi driver for more than 23 years already. He began driving one of his father's taxis, but this changed with the passage of time as his and his wife's efforts enabled them buy a business license for their own taxi. In this way, the income from his driving became his own. Two years ago his biggest wish was to buy another license, a dream he fulfilled with the help of a loan from Vision Fund two years ago. He now has an employee. To\u00f1o works every day from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., in this way he can answer any calls from his clients, even going to pick them up at their homes.

Two of his children are in school and one is still a baby. \r\n\r\nHe has been a businessman managing a kitchen selling soup and roasted meat, known as nyama choma with ugali. He is so good at roasting meat, that it has allowed him to fulfill more customer's orders. He has been in this business since 2006. Working from 8am to midnight each working day, he is able to make a very good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, this is his third credit request which he will use to buy a fridge and stocks of meat for his business.

She is 35 years old and she lives with her family in Iloilo, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for years and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her child. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their child with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Pabiosa would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 6,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Pabiosa hopes for her business to grow and get bigger. She also dreams of giving her family a better future.

These hard-working women are truly heart-centered and determined to move ahead in their lives. Their average age is 35 and they have an average of 2 years of formal education. They each have an average of 4 children. The ladies work in textile production, creating the traditional clothing of the area. As Santa Cruz La Laguna draws tourists to the area, the women want to have enough inventory to attract customers.\r\n\r\nThe group has just welcomed a new member whose name is Paulina. At 23 years of age, she is the youngest in the Trust Bank. Paulina has one child. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase thread, needles and fabric to create traditional tubular skirts, called \u201ccortes\", and elaborately embroidered belts. She is motivated to create a better future for her small child. \r\n\r\nPaulina decided to join the Trust Bank because she witnessed how the members of the Trust Bank improved their lives with their small loans and education, a combination that Friendship Bridge calls Microcredit Plus.  A portion of the monthly Trust Bank meeting is dedicated to sharing knowledge by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. Some of the topics covered include effective business management practices (business design, budgeting, customer service, marketing, accounting), as well as nutrition, health and hygiene. The ladies learn about women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n \r\nWe look forward to providing a follow-up report on Paulina and the ladies in the \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Oro\u201d Trust Bank. They are thankful to have the opportunity to secure loans and education. Thank you, KIVA

He gets his supplies from sub-regions. \r\n\r\nHe is on his second individual loan for merchants at the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso out of concern for satisfying his burgeoning customer base. The previous loan was correctly paid back. This loan will enable him to purchase 15 boxes of notebooks of different brans, 8 boxes of pens, 5 boxes of rulers for students, and a significant amount of erasers. \r\n\r\nHis sales are made to men and women customers paying with cash or credit at the bookstore in the BABEMBA district. He envisions making an average profit of 250,000 francs CFA every two months.

Her farm\u2019s honey is also very famous in her village, but unfortunately the quantity of it is not a lot, unlike the number of her customers who want to buy it.\r\n\r\nMarine lives with her husband, who works at the municipality, and they have a daughter who helps them in their farming activities. \r\n\r\nMarine asks for a loan of 600,000 Armenian drams, since she wants to buy ten bee families. In this way, she wants both to enlarge her beekeeping activities and have more honey for sale.

","en":"Ainagul is 64 years old, a widow, and the mother of four children. Ainagul has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she has worked with livestock breeding for a period of 37 years. Thanks to Ainagul's purposefulness and hard work, she currently has two dairy cows, one calf and two bulls on her farm. During the season Ainagul also works with field crop cultivation on her own plot of land of 5.20 hectares. \r\n\r\nAinagul grows clover and sweet cord. Ainagul's monthly income is around 6,000 som (KGS). This is unfortunately not enough to cover living costs. Therefore Ainagul turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) with an aim to develop her livestock breeding business, specifically to purchase bulls and cows. Ainagul also plans to use part of the money on harvesting her crops. \r\n\r\nAinagul intends to resell the cattle at the local livestock market. She will direct the income from the loan to further increasing the number of livestock, which leads to a larger income and improved living

Her mother had to be working, and so Vilma couldn't continue her studies.  Vilma's husband is a small-time farmer, and they do not have children.\r\n\r\nVilma's primary work is taking care of the home. She's been doing it ever since she was little and helping her mother, while her mother worked in other people's homes. She said that experience has helped a lot, as she can now run her own home without any trouble. Her job keeps no schedule since she always has to be available to whatever needs doing around the house.\r\n\r\nVilma will use the loan so that her husband can plant beans. He will purchase seed, herbicides, and pesticides. In their current economic situation, they can't continue planting, but with the loan, he'll be able to do his work and increase his income from the harvest. He will be able to sell his beans and earn money. She will also use the money to fix up their house and expand it to live more comfortably.\r\n\r\nVilma is planning for a future where they have more land for planting so that they can earn greater income. She also wants to build her own home since the house they're living in now isn't their own. That way, when they have a child, they will be able to give her a larger, safer place to live.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1697120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"buy agricultural supplies and expand her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-09-28T23:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-28T23:20:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":22.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":22.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":24.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.55,"local_amount":23.55,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":23.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420688},{"amount":22.09,"local_amount":22.09,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":22.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545396},{"amount":24.84,"local_amount":24.84,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":24.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145789},{"amount":20.47,"local_amount":20.47,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769338},{"amount":27.03,"local_amount":27.03,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":27.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624832987},{"amount":26.27,"local_amount":26.27,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":26.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200749},{"amount":26.25,"local_amount":26.25,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":26.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536514},{"amount":27.93,"local_amount":27.93,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":27.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802455},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":27.27,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":27.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482576},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":29.54,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":29.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540203},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":44.76,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":44.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711453780}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T00:36:16Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:50:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":774049,"name":"Goretti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gorreti is a married woman who has seven children, and four are still attending school.

The majority of its inhabitants are very hard workers and work in industries related to the ocean. This is where Janeth works. She is 43 years old, and married with two children who are 14 and 12, and are in high school. Her husband is a driver. \r\n\r\nJaneth is an entrepreneurial woman who, in addition to being a teacher, also works in sales so she can make some extra income to provide for her family's future. She has a convenience store in her home, where she sells products such as stationary, supplies, and soft drinks, among other things. While she teaches, her children run the store, although she is the one who manages client demands.

However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Donara has been able to run her production in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

The majority of the people there are very hard-working and work in jobs related to the sea. This is where Maritza lives. She's 43 years old, married and has five kids from this marriage. They are 23, 20, 16, 13 and 5. The youngest ones are in high school and one has special needs, which requires a lot of care. Her husband is a fisherman and a driver.\r\n\r\nMaritza is a great housewife. She's asking for the loan so that her husband can use it for work. He has a boat that he uses to fish, and together with two others, they go deep out into the ocean to fish. They go for three or four days to work and once they're done, they go back to shore where they bring the fish to vendors who come to buy their products. In the days that he's not fishing, he also carries cargo on his motortaxi, which is how he makes a living when he can't fish. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy nets, string, fuel and spare parts for his motortaxi so that he can provide a better service. She's been a part of the credit group for over six years and she likes it because of the help that she always gets from the loans. Her dream is to have her children become professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1697233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy nets, string, fuel and spare parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jaramijo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-09-29T02:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-29T02:40:18Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1512.74,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":126.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":508.33,"local_amount":504.24,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":508.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562429560},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":252.12,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":254.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579565246},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":252.12,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":254.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595162485},{"amount":381.24,"local_amount":378.18,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":381.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785243},{"amount":127.11,"local_amount":126.08,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":127.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232037}],"funded_date":"2014-10-02T05:26:06Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T11:28:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chelsea Clark","image":1536258}},{"id":772292,"name":"Diego","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diego es estudiante de la carrera de Ingenier\u00eda Comercial, esta cursando el 5to a\u00f1o, vive con sus padres y una hermana, est\u00e1 luchando pero aun no tiene un trabajo formal, se dedica a realizar trabajos por computadora  para los estudiantes de los colegios  que est\u00e1n cerca de su casa, su objetivo es terminar su estudio y de esa manera trabajar en su profesi\u00f3n. \nPide este pr\u00e9stamo para poder invertirlo en el pago de las cuotas de su universidad, de manera a poder seguir con sus estudios, luchando por cumplir con su meta.","en":"Diego is a comercial engineering student in his fifth year.
