They go along with a fishing vessel to which they turn over the product of their daily fishing every afternoon. Once these days have elapsed, they return to their homes and thus after a few days they go back to their work on the sea.

She is 52 this years and is happily married with four children. Three of her children are still in school. Fatima lives with her family in Abura Koforidua in the Central Region of Ghana. Fatima has been farming for the past 20 years as her source of income in support of the husband in caring for the family. She grows oranges and coconuts. She also owns a small provisions shop, though her main source of income remains to be from the farms. She also belongs to a registered local farming association that negotiates prices on their behalf. Fatima has confidence in the future prospects of her business since her farming association has a lot of good will from development partners in building their capacity to maintain farm hygiene to increase crop yield. Fatima has not the physical strength to maintain the farm alone as a woman. Her main challenge is how to finance the costs of maintaining her farm to maximize productivity. Particularly, Fatima has to hire laborers to harvest and transport the crops to a point of sale. A micro-loan is essential for Fatima to maximize profit. She hopes to expand her farms and her provisions shop with any profit she makes. She will also use her profit to support the husband to pay for their children's school fees. A working capital loan of GHS 1,000 is required by Fatima to pay for the cost of harvesting and transporting the crops for sale. Fatima is grateful to all her micro-lenders for their generosity in supporting her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":88.12,"image":{"id":1699709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To hire labor to harvest and transport the crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Abura Koforidua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2014-09-29T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-29T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Addisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kwesi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.73,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":304.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"payment_id":752017125}],"funded_date":"2014-10-17T15:32:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shali"}},{"id":773486,"name":"Danaya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les cinq femmes du groupe Danaya vivent toutes dans des familles nucl\u00e9aires.

Seamstress services are in high demand in her district because women and girls prefer to have their dresses sewn according to their size and taste. This is why they seek the services of a seamstress. Because Shahnoza knows this trade, she wants to start her own business in this sphere and, thus, earn a living. Shahnoza has experience in the sewing business. She spent almost a year in Russia with her husband and learned how to sew women's European dresses there. This is why Shahnoza is planning to take orders to sew national and European dresses. Additionally, she can bake national desserts and want to buy an oven to make desserts. The goal of Shahnoza's loan is to purchase a modern sewing machine and also an oven in order to start two new businesses.\r\n\r\nShahnoza has two children - a son and a daughter.

it as she had intended.  She is very thankful to Kiva and to all the lenders who supported her.  Jazgul's family has grown a little larger, as she is now the happy mother of three children.  Jazgul's farming business now also consists of two cows, 10 sheep and one horse.  In addition, she grows wheat, potatoes and hay on her own 3-hectare plot of land.  Jazgul is planning to further develop her farming business, and for this reason she has once more turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 70,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy some sheep for fattening and resale.  She is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further developing her business.

having used the funds as intended. She is very thankful to all investors and to Kiva. She now has two cows, 10 sheep and 10 goats, as well as her own 2.0 hectare piece of land where she grows barley and hay.

This is a task that many of the locals carry out to be able to fish for the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nThe need to buy new fishing nets and renovate his boat has led him to request a loan to improve his income and quality of life. This is why Lorenzo is asking for a loan to buy fishing nets and renovate his boat.

She is a wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in Kapsowar, in the northern Rift Valley region of Kenya. This mother of two has been practicing mixed farming for the past two years; her primary sources of income have been milk and some vegetables she plants. Lucia enjoys the returns she gets, but she is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. She has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by acquiring a good quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nDairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and milk prices in the recent past have been going up. So Lucia, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nLucia said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan request because they offer agriculture-based loans, and their interest rate is low and on a reduced scale. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Lucia hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. \r\n\r\nThis loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children.

The water filter also increases disposable income to users like Lam due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal, by decreasing time spent foraging for wood, and decreasing the amount of money used to  purchase bottled water.\r\n\r\nThe filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most find the filter works from 3-5 years."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1700176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to purchase TerraClear water filters so they can have access to safe drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Nongbok District, Khammoune Province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":393,"posted_date":"2014-09-29T17:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-29T17:20:10Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khambod","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khambod","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keovilai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanlang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khamsee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ammala","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banthom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khammee","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khampong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khamphouvong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Po Sackda","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khamlai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vadsana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Chanha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LAK","disbursal_amount":8460000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8460000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":201.51,"local_amount":1585866.63,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1621449.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579772252},{"amount":114.36,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-25T11:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":920193.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":597066540},{"amount":228.72,"local_amount":1800000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1840387.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611965572},{"amount":114.36,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":920193.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637757897},{"amount":114.36,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":920193.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649742400},{"amount":114.36,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":920193.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665232070},{"amount":187.33,"local_amount":1474133.37,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1507209.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681538586}],"funded_date":"2014-09-29T20:34:23Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T17:05:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":774565,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca is thankful that she was granted a 10,000 PHP loan which she used to purchase various grocery items and products needed in her general store.

Gulmira also has a 0.50 hectare land plot, where she grows watermelons that she then sells to wholesale buyers.

Yoledys, aware of the valuable experience, proposed that they start a business and for that reason she went to her father who had just received an inheritance. He loaned her a million Colombian pesos, which were used to construct two wooden stalls and she started ordering Peruvian aloe which is very high quality. Little by little they have established themselves. Currently she has two mobile stalls that travel through many neighborhoods selling a product that's natural and medicinal and is consumed by an increasingly large number of people. Her goal is to have a local distributor and eventually have money to buy her own home and provide a quality education to her daughters, a 3 year old and one who's not quite a year old. Currently Yoledys is applying for a credikiva, the first financing she's requested from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and she'll use it to buy an ice machine to make ice. Keeping in mind that at this time she needs to spend eight thousand colombian pesos daily to serve the majority of the neighborhoods. With this investment her business will generate lots more profit which will allow her to invest in many more upgrades for her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1697086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"To purchase an ice machine to make ice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-09-29T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-29T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":88.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yoleidys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98567},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":101278},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104063},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":106924},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109865},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":112886},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":115991},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":119180},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":122458},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125825},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":129286},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":132841},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":136494},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140248},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144094}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.65,"local_amount":98567,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100004.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562430991},{"amount":47,"local_amount":101278,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":102755.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.05,"payment_id":579566712},{"amount":47.77,"local_amount":104063,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":105581.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.71,"payment_id":611789137},{"amount":44.73,"local_amount":106924,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":108483.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.22,"payment_id":624849344},{"amount":38.95,"local_amount":87492,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":88768.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.01,"payment_id":636603425},{"amount":607.73,"local_amount":1301676,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1320665.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.18,"payment_id":649571649}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T15:59:27Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manolo Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":772938,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La joven a quien se le ha pixeleado la cara por tener 27 a\u00f1os de edad y vivir en una zona de alto riesgo, posee un negocio de venta de ropa desde hace 3 a\u00f1os, es madre sotera vive en casa propia con sus tres hijos y sus padres, con su trabajo logrado salir adelante, la joven esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar ropa para damas y caballeros por mayor y asi poder continuar con sus ventas para tener mejores ganancias.","en":"The young woman, whose picture has been blurred because she is 27 years old and lives in a high risk zone, has had a clothing sales business for three years, is a single mother, and lives in her own house with her three children and her parents.

With his loan, he plans to buy some fertilizer appropriate for the developmental and maturation stage that the crop is in. He also plans to take the area into account and apply the fertilizer to the coffee crop at the right time, as well as buy some seedbed plants that are well developed and healthy so that they will quickly grow to a size similar to the crop already planted. This will improve the density of plants by area. He also plans to do some cultural work, like soil conservation, by making leveled canals so that the rainwater cannot wash away soil, mainly in the places with the most slope.\r\n\r\nWith these new practices he hopes to reach his goal of having a healthier plantation, more fertile soil, and thus a better harvest. By buying these appropriate products, he will have a higher-quality product for the consumer. This is the first loan that he has received from FUDECOSUR.

He is single and lives with his parents and siblings, who are his first priority.<br \/><br \/>He wants to buy fertilizer with the loan, suitable to the present state of his crops and the area he grows in, to apply it at the appropriate time. He will also buy a few plants from a greenhouse that are well-developed and healthy. They will quickly attain a size similar to those already planted so it will increase the density of plants per area. <br \/><br \/>He will also do some cultivation work to conserve the soil such as canals at a level that the water from the rains can't wash away the soil in the sloped sections. With these new working practices he hopes to fulfill the objective of having a plantation in better health with more fertile soil and in the end a better harvest. By buying the appropriate products he will have a higher quality product for the consumer. <br \/><br \/>This is the first loan that he has received from FUDECOSUR.

Chanthone is excited that she was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water-borne disease-causing organisms. Some people in the village, including Chanthone, are able to buy bottled water. But the water filter increases disposable income to users, by decreasing the amount of money they would otherwise have used to purchase bottled water. The water filter also increases disposable income to users like Chanthone, due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal for boiling water, and it decreases the amount of time they must spend foraging for wood.

Local residents and tourists alike are her regular customers.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to buy more fish.  She is positive that her sales and income will increase.  She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial assistance that will be given her. Her earnings from her fish selling will greatly help meet her family's living expenses.\r\n\r\nJocelyn hopes to grow her business to improve their quality of life and to give her parents a more comfortable life.   \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1700404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

This group consists of eight members and is led by a Board of Directors in which Sra. Norah is the president.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in various businesses such as managing a grocery store, selling cheese, selling chickens wholesale, providing Internet service, making banners, selling fruit, selling personal accessories, and selling cosmetics.  <br \/><br \/>This loan will benefit small entrepreneurs such as Sra. Norah.  She says this is her first year since joining Pro Mujer.  Norah received an invitation during a mass promotion for the organization.  She currently has a business of selling popcorn.  Norah became familiar with this type of work because she was in a family business that was started by her parents.  Eight years ago, she decided to start her own independent business.   <br \/><br \/>The loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying corn in bulk.  She acquires her supplies from the wholesale vendors in the city of La Paz and then she prepares what she will sell at her vending post.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income for supporting her family financially.  Norah is single, but lives with her parents.  <br \/><br \/>When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Norah said that she enjoys the loans and the health services offered by the organization.

She's originally from Colombia, but she visited Costa Rica some time ago thanks to a friend who took her on vacation. She married there, but after five years, she got a divorce from her verbally abusive partner.  Maritza says that in Colombia, chocolate is widely used and eaten, and so she's always been fascinated by this sweet. She currently makes all kinds of shapes in chocolate, but she particularly wants to specialize in selling the molds. Her molds are designs exclusive to Colombia, and she assured me that nobody has the kind of variety in mold designs that she does.\r\n\r\nMaritza began selling molded chocolate four years ago and started selling the molds themselves two years ago. She finds selling the molds to be the better business, since the molds are both high quality and unique in their design. This loan will let her purchase additional merchandise from molds to cupcake wrappers, as well as a computer, which she urgently needs to keep promoting her products.\r\n\r\nShe is a woman who has demonstrated the drive to fight for the well being of her daughter, first and foremost, and also for her dream of becoming a large distributor of molds and other dessert-making products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1698259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"purchase and resell molds for making chocolate","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2014-09-29T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-29T21:20:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":34952.94},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":35652},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":36365.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":37092.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":37834.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":38590.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":39362.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40149.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.99,"local_amount":34952.94,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-01T11:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":36283.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581607098},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":35446.1,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-29T10:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":36795.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595473274},{"amount":70.09,"local_amount":36570.94,"processed_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":37963.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611996960},{"amount":146.53,"local_amount":76448.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-22T12:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":79358.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650744837},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":34792.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-20T12:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36116.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666210321},{"amount":88.02,"local_amount":45924.6,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":47672.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681351417},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":35864.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":37229.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696781576}],"funded_date":"2014-09-29T23:32:28Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:59:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":774689,"name":"Eufemia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eufemia is 45 years old and has three children.

I'm very proud of one of my older works, The Virgin of Guadalupe, on display in Mexico. I lingered 20 days on this work. Juan weaves charming portrayals of little children; he loves capturing their expressions. It is something magical that just cannot be described.\"<br><br>\n\n\"I thank you beforehand for this microcredit, because it will allow me to stock up on wool and cotton. I also require the assistance of additional artisans - I am getting on in age, and it's getting difficult to work on my own, especially with the holiday season approaching quickly.\"<br><br>\n\nUse

Glenda and her husband work hard to give their children a better future.\r\n\r\nGlenda operates a tricycle unit. Her husband drives the tricycle that carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Coron, Palawan, Philippines, a tricycle is the most  common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle.  The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to go to church, city hall, market, and to other destinations within their community.  They even transport from one town to another. They earn a minimum of Php 700 a day.\r\n\r\nGlenda is requesting a Php 11,000 loan to pay for repair, maintenance and gas for her tricycle unit.  It is important that her tricycle is always in good running condition to ensure good service and steady income. It is their source of income.\r\n\r\nGlenda dreams of buying another tricycle unit to improve her income and send all her children to school.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Djung is single and lives with his family in North Bogor, a suburban area about a two-hour drive from Jakarta, the capital city. To support his family, Djung runs a small shop selling mobile phones, SIM cards, phone accessories, airtime, and household electronics. He is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\nAbout a month ago, Djung was introduced to Ruma by one of his friends. He quickly became interested in joining Ruma because he wants to increase his income.

His wife is a homemaker, and they have a three-year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nJorge has been employed in public security for six years.  He decided on this job only when he finished school and didn't find a job for two years.  Then he entered the academy of public security, and he has practiced the profession since then.\r\n\r\nHe also works in agriculture on his free days.  His schedule is 6 a.m. until 11 a.m., and he travels a distance of 30 minutes by cart.\r\n\r\nThe loan he's requesting is to buy five sacks of soil amendments for his cornfield.  The field's ready for the application so the crop will be very good--better than last season, which wasn't very good because of the phenomenon of El Ni\u00f1o.  This investment will help him a lot because currently the winter has improved and he'll apply sufficient soil amendments.\r\n\r\nJorge's dream is that God will always take care of him in his job so he can keep going with his family and keep cultivating his land.  This will help the family a lot because this income is extra.  Part of the crop is for consumption and part is to sell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1698278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy soil amendments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-09-29T22:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-29T22:00:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":28.42},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.86,"local_amount":12.86,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420705},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":43.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":43.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545410},{"amount":35.5,"local_amount":35.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":35.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145807},{"amount":308.4,"local_amount":308.4,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":308.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769356}],"funded_date":"2014-10-01T17:57:42Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":773067,"name":"Mildrey Johanna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mildrey una joven de 24 a\u00f1os de edad muy trabajadora dedica al mundo de las confecciones un trabajo que en alguna \u00e9poca fue muy demandado en Colombia pero con el pasar del tiempo se quebraron las grandes empresas, una de estas empresas quebradas es donde trabajaba Mildrey como operaria y de all\u00ed recogi\u00f3 y adquiri\u00f3 toda la experiencia con la que decidi\u00f3 montar un local. \n\nHoy en d\u00eda Mildrey tiene su propio taller de confecci\u00f3n y genera dos empleos, pero como confeccionista a terceros siempre tiene la aspiraci\u00f3n de salir adelante. \nBuscando siempre destacarse por su calidad de confecci\u00f3n y precios justo Mildrey solicita un cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar una maquina fileteadora que no solo representara un empleo m\u00e1s que generara sino que tambi\u00e9n le ayudara a mejorar sus tiempos de producci\u00f3n y calidad de confecci\u00f3n.\n\nTiene una hija de 8 a\u00f1os de edad, su sue\u00f1o es darle todo a esta hija, poder tener un local donde confeccione su propia marca de ropa y genere empleo \n","en":"Mildrey is a very hardworking 24-year-old young woman.

She's single and lives with her parents. \n\nHer desires and goals grow all the time.  When she thinks about and recognizes that all that is good in life requires great sacrifice, she's grateful to her parents for their support up to the present, because throughout her life they have been concerned with giving her what she needed.  With great humility she recognizes that her parents are persevering people.\n\nAmong Wendy's qualities that she's proud of is being known as a responsible person who's dedicated to studying and working.  She's supportive and very charitable with other people.\n\nHer initial motivation for continuing to attend school is being able to grow professionally because education requires a lot of sacrifice these days.  She wants to contribute to the development of her country, implementing innovative techniques in processes in which human resources are extremely important to achieve goals and objectives.  In her family, she wants to help her parents, giving them a better quality of life to pay them back for all the effort they have made for her.\n\nThe young lady is grateful to everyone who has believed in her professional abilities and motivated her to strive more all the time to realize her dreams.  She remembers that at the beginning of her university program she had the idea of staying there until she finished her college education.  She remembered, however, that her parents never imposed limitations: \"My parents went through needy times, but they never allowed my education to suffer.  This is undoubtedly the best gift they gave me.  I am who I am today because of them.\"\n\nHer plans are focused on a good education and business success through her knowledge.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":366.47,"image":{"id":1694654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
