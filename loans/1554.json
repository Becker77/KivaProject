She lives with her husband and 5-year-old son. To cover her family's needs, Lusine is engaged in the cultivation of wheat, potato and garlic. Her husband helps her sell the agricultural products in the local market. As their needs are growing day by day, Lusine needs to expand her agribusiness to be able to effectively meet her family's needs. She needs a loan of USD 1,500 to purchase seeds, fuel for land cultivation and hire workers for cultivation process. She previously took a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Lusine was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Lusine and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":433,"image":{"id":1700566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Ella utilizar\u00e1 su cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s material y seguir haciendo servilletas y manteles. \n\nPor otro lado, Maria Mercedes y Porfirio son esposos desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, tienen cuatro hijas de las cuales ahora ya solo una depende de dicha pareja.

Despu\u00e9s, al mudarse a su casa actual, opt\u00f3 por instalar una tienda formal pero esto fue con ayuda de los prestamos de VisionFund M\u00e9xico. Poco a poco pudo comprar m\u00e1s productos como leche, refrescos, az\u00facar, productos enlatados, etc. Do\u00f1a Mercedes esta muy agradecida con KIVA y VisionFund porque podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda.

The tortillas will be in the center of the table and are always wrapped in a napkin embroidered by hand, like the ones  In\u00e9s makes.  She will use her loan to buy more material and continue making napkins and tablecloths.\r\n\r\nFor their part, Maria Mercedes and Porfirio have been husband and wife for 30 years.  They have four children, of whom only one, a daughter, remains their dependent.  Porfirio works selling fruits and vegetables in the community and will use his loan to buy more merchandise.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mercedes, as they affectionately call her, is the representative of the group and so they decided to name their group after her.   She is 48 years old and has managed a small grocery store for more than 10 years.  Mercedes says, \"It was our own project because previously we lived across from an elementary school, and it occurred to me that I could begin selling sweets, chicharrones, and jello desserts that I made myself at home.\"  Later, after moving to their current house, Mercedes chose to start an actual store, this time with the help of the lenders of VisionFund Mexico.  Little by little she was able to buy more products such as milk, soft drinks, sugar, canned goods, etc.  Mercedes is very grateful to KIVA and VisionFund because she will be able to buy more merchandise.   Mercedes claims to have no problems but in fact has a very positive attitude and doesn't worry about the competitors around her.  One of her dreams is that the business will grow and continue to contribute to the costs of the home and of her daughter's education.  \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in a garden located in the heart of the city where the members live.

7 am a las 4 pm\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que est\u00e1 solicitando a CREDICAMPO,  es para comprar un cepillo el\u00e9ctrico, una sierra cortadora de madera que esto le hace falta para dejar en buen estado los muebles esto le ayudara mucho, ya que se le arruinaron las sierras que ten\u00eda y comprarla as\u00ed de una sola vez con lo que le queda es dif\u00edcil por eso ha acudido al cr\u00e9dito y de las ganancias ira pagando su cuota del cr\u00e9dito.\n\nLos sue\u00f1os de Jos\u00e9 son los de tener una carpinter\u00eda grande y en un futuro independizare ya a elaborar cajas, ya que ese negocio es bastante rentable y as\u00ed darle todo los que sus hijos necesiten, su estudio y que se preparen acad\u00e9micamente y que su esposa  no le falte nada.\n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9, 32, has his diploma.  His wife is a homemaker and they've had two children together.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has made a living  as a carpenter since he was 12 years old.  His father taught him the job, because he, too, has always worked in the field of carpentry making caskets for the town.  Jos\u00e9 works as an employee making caskets, but he also has a shop at home and makes beds, toy chests, chairs, tables, etc.  In that job his father helps him from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., because the other job is from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe loan he's requesting from CrediCampo is to buy a wood brush, a power saw that he needs to leave the furniture in good condition.  This will help him a lot because the saws he had got ruined.  It's difficult to buy it all at once, so he's asking for the loan.  He'll make his loan payments with his profits.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's dream is to have a big furniture shop and go out on his own in the future to make caskets, because it's a very profitable business.  That way he can give his children everything they need, their education and academic preparation, and his wife will have everything she needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1698290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a wood brush, a power saw","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":23.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":26.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.6,"local_amount":21.6,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":21.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420707},{"amount":24.57,"local_amount":24.57,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":24.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545412},{"amount":22.54,"local_amount":22.54,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":22.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145808},{"amount":24.8,"local_amount":24.8,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":24.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769358},{"amount":24.5,"local_amount":24.5,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":24.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833001},{"amount":25.77,"local_amount":25.77,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":25.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200764},{"amount":26.81,"local_amount":26.81,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":26.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536527},{"amount":27.04,"local_amount":27.04,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":27.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802466},{"amount":27.65,"local_amount":27.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":27.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482586},{"amount":74.72,"local_amount":74.72,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":74.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540215}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T03:42:02Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:12:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":773106,"name":"Arquimides Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nArqu\u00edmides se dedica la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, este trabajo lo aprendi\u00f3 de un amigo que lo invitaba a que trabajar como ayudante y as\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 el trabajo y lo ha seguido haciendo;

He learned this work from a friend who invited him to work as an assistant and that is how he learned the trade. He has continued doing it, but he also farms in the afternoon.\r\nThe loan he is requesting is in order to buy two sacks of fertilizer to cultivate the field he made since that from the winter went badly and in this he hopes to prepare it well.  He hopes to God that it will be good since this loan will be used for agriculture.  With the previous loan, he bought five sheets of corrugated tin, three bags of cement, and four uprights in order to construct the bathroom of his house which is very old.

Para hacer la masa de ma\u00f3z, los granos se calientan con agua y con con cal durante algunos minutos, despu\u00e9s la mezcla se muele bien para obtener la masa y esta puede tener distintas tonalidades como blanco, amarillo, negro, azul y rosado. Adem\u00e1s, la masa de ma\u00edz permite elaborar una gran variedad de platillos mexicanos: tacos, quesadillas, gorditas, enchiladas, chilaquiles, huaraches, tacos dorados, tostadas y los famosos tamales. Esto no podr\u00eda lograrse sin la ayuda de un molino de nixtamal.\n\n\nLas integrantes del grupo platican que en casa de Luc\u00eda hay un molino al cual acuden personas de la comunidad para preparar su nixtamal y en referencia a este, al solicitar su cr\u00e9dito a VisionFund M\u00e9xico, eligieron el nombre que ahora las identifica.\n\nLucia a\u00fan conserva su molino pero invertir\u00e1 su cr\u00e9dito en alimento para becerros al igual que Maximina.

Afortunadamente, su clientela crec\u00eda poco a poco y con el tiempo, Rosaura se vio obligada a buscar otro local m\u00e1s grande. Despu\u00e9s conoci\u00f3 al padre de sus hijos quien se dedicaba a vender ropa y a pesar de su separaci\u00f3n, ella aprendi\u00f3 del negocio y ahora en su est\u00e9tica tambi\u00e9n vende ropa. Asimismo aprovecha los espacios en mercados para vender esta mercanc\u00eda. Esta vez, Rosaura necesita invertir en m\u00e1s ropa. Ella es muy feliz con sus dos actividades aunque menciona que la distancia es una dificultad para ella. Todas las ma\u00f1anas se tiene que levantar a las 5:30 am para poder prepararse y llevar a su hijo a la escuela y llegar a su establecimiento justo a tiempo para abrir. Rosaura atiende a sus clientes de 8 am a 7 pm y de all\u00ed hace una hora m\u00e1s para regresar a casa. Es as\u00ed que su sue\u00f1o es tener un local m\u00e1s cerca.

To make corn meal, the grains must be heated with water and lime for a few minutes.  Then, everything must be mixed together to form the dough, which is a combination of distinct colors (white, yellow, black, blue, and pink). This corn dough is used to make a wide variety of traditional Mexican dishes, including tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, gorditas, chilaquiles, masa tortillas, fried tacos, tostados and the famous tamales.  This type of cooking would not be possible without a corn mill.\r\n\r\nThere is a corn mill in Luc\u00eda's house where people from the community go to prepare this typical corn grain mixture. Because of the importance of the corn mill, the members chose this as their group name. They are requesting support from VisionFund M\u00e9xico. \r\n\r\nLucia still maintains her mill, but she will invest her portion of the loan in food for her calves; Maximina will do the same. Maria Cruz and Nicolasa will invest in food for their lambs.\r\n\r\nRosaura is the final member of the group. She is thirty-two years old and is the mother of two children; one of them is in school.  She is a very enterprising woman and says, \"I only finished primary school. Immediately after, I started working in another city where I took a few styling classes. I then returned to my hometown and decided to start my own small shop where I could offer my services.\" Fortunately, her customer base has grown bit by bit over time and she is consequently looking for a larger space for her shop. She met the father of her children, who sold clothes.  Despite the fact that they are now separated, she still learned the business and she now sells clothing too.  Rosaura also takes advantage of the local markets and sells her merchandise at a stall there. \r\n\r\nRosaura needs to invest in more clothing. She is very happy with her two selling locations although the distance between them is sometimes difficult. Every morning, she gets up at 5:30am to get ready, bring her son to school, and get to her shop in time to open. Rosaura helps customers from 8am to 7pm and then spends another hour traveling back home.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she dreams of having her shop closer to home. With a smile on her face she says \"I don't know, but I would like to never leave my little shop since it is one I love most.\"\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in a garden in the center of town where the members live. Rosaura is the one wearing the blue vest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5750,"image":{"id":1698018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

","en":"Vitalyi is from the village of Gladovka. He is 32 years old, married, and the father of young children.

This business activity generates an income to sustain his family. As workers, he, his mother, and his sister decided to start up their own independent business in their own home, selling clothing garments in nearby towns such as Sabanagrande, Palmar de Varela, and other towns on the eastern route of the Atl\u00e1ntico department. They saved up to buy sewing machines, equipment, tools, and supplies and started sewing two years ago.\r\n\r\nThey sell their products door-to-door in all of the towns in Atl\u00e1ntico. They buy their materials, supplies, and accessories directly from sewing warehouses where they are offered special discounts. Their goal is to obtain better productivity with new machines to increase their sales and earn even more.\r\n\r\nEdgardo dreams of giving an education to his five children so that they can become successful professionals. He is applying for a Kiva loan, his first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to buy primary materials and supplies. He will then prepare for the biggest commercial season of the year, the last trimester. With this investment, he will produce blouses and shirts, which are the products his clients demand most during this season.

un fant\u00e1stico municipio del Estado de M\u00e9xico que adem\u00e1s fue reconocido como \"Pueblo M\u00e1gico\". El lugar es famoso por albergar majestuosas casas, monumentos y el palacio municipal, pero principalmente por su cafeter\u00eda: un vag\u00f3n de tren que simplemente qued\u00f3 detenido. Anteriormente, la poblaci\u00f3n estaba llena de minas de oro, pero fueron vaciadas en su totalidad. Ahora ya solo quedan recuerdos y los peque\u00f1os carros donde sol\u00edan transportar el mineral. Hoy en d\u00eda los habitantes son empleados, comerciantes o artesanos.\n\nLos integrantes del grupo \u201cArtesanos del Oro\u201d est\u00e1n muy orgullosos por pertenecer a un lugar con tanta historia y precisamente decidieron utilizar la palabra que hace referencia a su actividad.\n\nAng\u00e9lica pertenece al grupo, ella tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada desde hace 15 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Sergio quien trabaja como chofer en la capital del pa\u00eds. La pareja tiene tres hijos, de los cuales dos estudian la preparatoria y uno la secundaria por lo que los gastos escolares son importantes y el sueldo del se\u00f1or Sergio no siempre es suficiente. Afortunadamente, desde hace 15 a\u00f1os tambi\u00e9n se han dedicado a la cr\u00eda y engorda de cerdos. Con su pr\u00e9stamo, Ang\u00e9lica comprar\u00e1 alimento para los cerdos que tiene en casa: 16 de grandes y 10 m\u00e1s de apenas unos meses. Invertir de esta manera (mayoreo) le ayudar\u00e1 ya que explica que en un s\u00f3lo d\u00eda, sus 10 cerdos grandes llegan a comer hasta 30 kilos de alimento que tiene un costo aproximado de $250 pesos (USD$ 20) y es precisamente el costo de la comida de los alimentos lo que representa el mayor reto en esta actividad.\n\n\u201cMe gusta cuidar mucho a los cerditos mas peque\u00f1os. Mi sue\u00f1o es llegar a tener un peque\u00f1o ranchito donde tengamos diferentes tipos de animales como borregos, pollos, caballos, vacas, etc\". Sin embargo la preparaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica de sus hijos tambi\u00e9n es primordial para Ang\u00e9lica:su hijo mayor quiere estudiar odontolog\u00eda, el segundo contabilidad y el m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o quiere ser veterinario y muestra demasiado inter\u00e9s por los animales que cr\u00edan sus padres.  \n\nPor otro lado, Magalli y Abigail, hermanas e integrantes, tuvieron la oportunidad de viajar a la ciudad de M\u00e9rida y participar en una feria para vender sus artesan\u00edas de ocoshal y lat\u00f3n. \u201cEl primer d\u00eda ya nos quer\u00edamos regresar porque solo vendimos dos piezas\". En los siguientes d\u00edas el panorama cambio totalmente porque lograron vender m\u00e1s de 70 piezas en total. Ellas est\u00e1n muy agradecidas por esta oportunidad que les brind\u00f3 VisionFund M\u00e9xico ya que lograron conseguir incluso clientes de otros pa\u00edses quienes les han encargado algunos pedidos.\n\nAcerca de los dem\u00e1s clientes: Carmen invertir\u00e1 su pr\u00e9stamo en su carpinter\u00eda, Antonio en medicamento para sus cerdos, Magalli y Abigail en material para sus artesan\u00edas.  \n\n*La foto fue tomada en el patio de la casa de Magalli y Abigail, lugar donde llevan a cabo sus reuniones de grupo. Ang\u00e9lica viste sudadera azul marino.","en":"History, art, and culture are the main characteristics of this fantastic municipality in Mexico, which has been recognized as a \"Magical Town\". This place is famous for its majestic houses, monuments, and its municipal palace, but mainly for its caf\u00e9: a railroad car which simply stopped moving. The town was once full of gold mines, but they were completely emptied out. Now all that is left are the memories and the small carts that used to transport minerals. Today the city's inhabitants are employees, tradespeople or artisans.\r\n\r\nThe members of the \u201cArtesanos del Oro\u201d (\"Gold Artisans\") group are proud to belong to a place with so much history, and they decided to use exactly the word that references its activity.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica, 37, belongs to this group. She has been married to Sergio for 15 years. He works as a driver in the country's capital. The couple has three children, of whom two are studying at a preparatory school and one is studying at secondary school. Their school expenses are important and Sergio's salary is not always sufficient. Fortunately, they have also been raising and fattening pigs for 15 years. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ang\u00e9lica will buy feed for the pigs they have at home: 16 large pigs and 10 more which are just a few months old. Investing in this way (wholesale) will help her. As she explains, her ten biggest pigs can eat up to 30 kilos of feed in a single day, which costs about 250 pesos (about 20 U.S. dollars).

My dream is to have a small ranch where we will have different types of animals such as sheep, chicken, horses, cows, etc.\" However, her children's education is also very important for Ang\u00e9lica. Her oldest child wants to study dentistry, her second child wants to study accounting, and the youngest wants to be a veterinarian, showing interest for the animals his parents take care of.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Magalli and Abigail, sisters and members of the group, had the opportunity to travel to the city of M\u00e9rida to participate in a fair to sell their woven leaf and brass artisan crafts. \"On the first day, we already wanted to come home because we only sold two pieces.\" During the following days, the story completely turned around and they managed to sell 70 pieces in total. They are very grateful for this opportunity, which was provided by VisionFund M\u00e9xico, because they also managed to obtain clients from other countries who have made some orders.\r\n\r\nRegarding the other borrowers: Carmen will invest the loan in his carpentry business, Antonio will invest in medication for his pigs, and Magalli and Abigail will buy materials for their artisan crafts.\r\n\r\nThis photo was taken on Magalli and Abigail's courtyard, where the group meetings take place.

She intends to use her loan to purchase a basket of bananas. She gets her supplies in M\u00e9dine. Her sales are made to a mixed customer base paying with cash in Djicoroni.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Barro hopes to make an average monthly profit of 10,000 francs CFA that will be used to meet her children\u2019s needs. The rest will be used in her business. She is counting a lot on this Soro Yiriwaso partnership to achieve her goals, including expanding her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1699613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fruit (bananas).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.27,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nakani            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barro              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":34019.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793542},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":34019.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758411},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":34019.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595318999},{"amount":64.92,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":34019.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.74,"payment_id":610752758},{"amount":64.92,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-03T11:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":34019.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.74,"payment_id":610752759},{"amount":59.88,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-14T11:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34019.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.79,"payment_id":624542542}],"funded_date":"2014-10-01T20:55:53Z","paid_date":"2015-04-14T11:01:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":774850,"name":"Kanee","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kanee is a married woman and has been blessed with three kids, who attend school.

The group members work in commerce, such as in selling condiments and fruit & vegetables (tomatoes, onions, cabbage, okra, and more\u2026). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing their business capital, the group members had decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their second solidarity loan. \r\n\r\nMs. Alimata (the woman sitting at the far left in the photo) is famous for selling onions in Lafiabougou. She intends to use her loan to purchase 7 sacks of onions. She gets her supplies in M\u00e9dine. Her sales are made to mostly women customers paying with cash in Lafiabougou.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Alimata hopes to make an average monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used to meet her children\u2019s sundry needs. The rest will be used in her business.

He does this with the help of his family as it is a family business.  \r\n\r\nCelso's dreams are to be able to continue working and that one day they will have a very big farm which will be well-known in the community (as their family are already very well-known) and which will enable them to give work to people from the community.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1698944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy coffee plants and fertilizers to help with planting the coffee, and to pay the workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celso Isaias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":59.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2016-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.64,"local_amount":47.64,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":47.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420712},{"amount":1452.36,"local_amount":1452.36,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545417}],"funded_date":"2014-10-28T10:26:23Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Hoare","image":null}},{"id":773641,"name":"Maria Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de un hijo de 5 a\u00f1os de edad.

Over the course of 12 years, Abdusamad has been trading dried fruits. Abdusamad has a small garden, where he grows fruits and berries, such as apricots, cherries, grapes, grapes with stones, persimmons and many more. After the fruit harvest, he dries them in the sun. After preparation, Abdusamad sells the dried fruits in the market. Dried fruits sell well. Since Abdusamad has only a few trees, there is not enough product. Therefore Abdusamad buys wholesale dried fruits and sells them. <br \/><br \/>Abdusamad is a young father and he wants to save money for his children's education, since he understand that having no education at the present time will get you nowhere. He plans to buy a new parcel of dried fruits, but currently does not have the needed amount. Therefore, Abdusamad applied to MDO Arvand for financial support. Abdusamad thanks MDO Arvand in advance for the support and trust."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1690708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy

The ladies are motivated to succeed and are seeking opportunities to generate income and improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is 43-year-old Ceferina. A married mother of seven, Ceferina has a textile business and works with her husband to make traditional skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d.  They sell the \u201ccortes\u201d by the dozen to various locales. Ceferina is requesting a new loan that she will use to purchase a variety of colorful, woven fabrics and other supplies.\r\n\r\nCeferina and the ladies in the \u201cLuz y Vida\u201d Trust Bank not only improve their lives with small loans but also with educational seminars given at their monthly meetings.  These seminars are interactive, and the ladies learn from one another. They learn how to manage their loans and increase their income with topics like budgeting, marketing, customer service and accounting. The women learn about empowerment, leadership, women\u2019s rights and sexual abuse. They also gain useful information about health, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants. \r\n\r\nThe women greatly appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge. Their newly acquired tools (loans and education) will help them empower themselves, sustain or expand their small businesses and eliminate poverty. They will watch as their children have opportunities that they never had, like attending school and possibly graduating from the university. KIVA investors are valuable partners with Friendship Bridge in this effort.

Her share of a new loan of GHS 4,500 will support her to buy four bags of shea nuts and to pay for fuel to power stoves for the processing of premium shea butter. There are off-taker organizations and individuals who buy the shea butter that Fuseina and her colleagues process for both local and exporting.\r\n\r\nShe intends to expand the business venture, and thereby increase her income and sustainability. With the increased income, she will be able to repay the loan, stay in business, and also support her five children to have better education and better food to eat.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1700846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy four bags of shea nuts and to pay for fuel to power stoves for the processing of premium shea butter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Nagdigu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":346,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T20:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T20:00:19Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fuseina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery-Kpema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bintu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memunatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arahamatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adamu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awabu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rahi-Bla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sahada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":749.99,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":762.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579581364},{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":749.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":762.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595174634},{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":749.99,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":762.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610570625},{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":749.99,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":762.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624243521},{"amount":219.83,"local_amount":749.99,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":762.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":636229156},{"amount":212.07,"local_amount":750.05,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":762.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.78,"payment_id":649580526}],"funded_date":"2014-10-05T22:22:34Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:54:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":775088,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel is an artisan from Ghana who specializes in hand-carved masks and drums.

","en":"Ashuron is 64 years old and an elderly woman, who has raised her son alone. She didn't finish high school. She is a pensioner, however, Ashuron's pension is small and is not enough for living. Her son is already 32 years old and he is a migrant worker in Russia. Ashuron does not sit idly by and does not intend to burden her son.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\n\nBenard is married and has three children. He runs a small business of grain-bulking and reselling. He also does farming with his wife. They have been farming for five years now and they are currently growing maize, beans, bananas, sugarcane, sunflowers, and gravellia. Benard is excited about beekeeping since it will earn him some income from the sale of honey and provide him with honey for food and medicine.\n\nThis is Benard\u2019s first loan with Honey Care Africa and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to expand his business and buy more beehives. Benard\u2019s hope for the future is to become a model beekeeper.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7.02,"image":{"id":1669589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Magunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":17100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":17100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.02,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":626.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579588815}],"funded_date":"2014-09-30T23:32:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":772876,"name":"Frederic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Frederic is 30 years old.

This left Trans-Nzoia one of Kenya\u2019s most cosmopolitan areas, with individuals from a variety of linguistic and ethnic groups living in close proximity. \n\nThe lush soil of the region ensures that farmers can grow a variety of crops, including maize, sunflower, sugar cane, millet, and beans. Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\n\nIsaac is a widower with eight children. He is a farmer. He has been farming for forty-eight years now and he is currently growing maize, potatoes, vegetables, bananas and tea. Isaac is excited about beekeeping as the bees will help in pollinating his crops. \n\nThis is Isaac\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to educate his children. Isaac\u2019s hope for the future is to see his children through life.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":11.4,"image":{"id":1692125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T22:00:05Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.4,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595182840}],"funded_date":"2014-10-01T15:44:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":770176,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Patrick.

lives in Kitale, in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya.

Kitale is located near Mount Elgon, East Africa's oldest and largest, solitary extinct volcano, whose substantial forest cover makes Kitale a high-potential beekeeping region.\n\nPhilip is married and has four children. Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for four years, and currently they are growing maize, beans and cassava, and they also keep livestock. Philip is excited about beekeeping, as the bees will help to pollinate his crops.\n\nThis is Philip\u2019s first loan with Honey Care.

With traditional cook stoves, there is a lot of indoor air pollution which leads to respiratory diseases and also there is a lot of charcoal consumption by the traditional stoves.\n\nCurrently, on average, each member spends USD 1.3 on charcoal everyday. The loan will enable them purchase high efficient cook stoves JIKOKOA that will save them up to 50% of their daily consumption on charcoal.

For the last 2 years, Eunice has been doing commercial dairy farming and subsistence crop farming. \n\nEunice has aspirations to expand her business and increase her income.

With this amount, she will also have the cow insured in order to mitigate risk of losses in the case of death of the animal. \n\nWith your funding, Eunice plans to reinvest the profits into the business to ensure stability and growth.
