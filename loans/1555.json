Mirrian is excited about beekeeping as the bees will help in pollinating her crops. \n\nThis is Mirrian's first loan with Honey Care and she plans to use the proceeds from her beehives to educate her children.

With her mother\u2019s consent, she took the interview for the cabin crew in Imphal and was selected by the Aviation Academy.  This profession is special to her because of the hospitality they deliver to their passengers. She has many moral supporters but financially, her mother was the only one who could support her, said she. Even though her mother is a government employee, she could barely maintain the household expenses with her weak finances. Sushmita is very much thankful to her mother for educating her in spite of the many difficulties they faced and giving her the platform to study and reach what she is today. Considering the situation, she strives forward until she achieves her goal. My mother has been the sole giver and there never was a time I could give anything to her, she said. She thinks this job will give her the opportunity to help her dear mother in financial matters. Nevertheless, she still needs to pay the security deposit to enroll in the training and has been disheartened by the thought of it. She sought help from family and friends and fortunately, her aunt suggested WSDS, which renders services like providing education loans to those who are needy. Now that she has availed the loan, she will be able to pay for the security deposit and join the training on time. She wishes to support her family when she starts earning and reduce their financial problems. She will repay the loan with her monthly salary. She is grateful to WSDS and Kiva for giving her the confidence to fly high and fulfil her aspirations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1701274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay a refundable deposit for training in the Aviation Academy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sushmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-01T17:04:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":775270,"name":"Merlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlyn is 54 years old.

All six children are attending school. \n\nJohn is a welder and fabricates metal works. He makes canopies and clean cook stoves for local people. John has been a client of the Field Partner since 2007 and has  completed the repayment of his ninth loan cycle. \n\nJohn wants to expand his shop, buy more equipment and employ more workers to assist him in the next five years so as to position himself to meet the demands of the business. Earlier he built his capacity in the Elsa Clean Stove building under the BeBi Project, ACP Science and Technology program, co-funded by the European Union. The Elsa Clean Cook stove has now become a household name within most rural communities of Ghana due to the benefits of the stove. Demand for the stove from more communities far exceed John's capacity to supply. \n\nJohn thus lacks the financial capacity to buy metal plates to produce more Elsa Clean Cook stoves to take advantage of the looming demand from household clients. If this hurdle is crossed, John will be able to have the requisite capacity to increase the production of the clean cook stove to meet the demand. A micro loan of GHS 4,500 will help John to purchase metal plates in bulk to produce enough Elsa Clean Cook stoves to meet his customers' needs. \n\nJohn plans to use the profit from the business for future expansion and also to meet his family needs. Elsa Clean Cook stoves use virgin pellets (palm kennel shells) which are free and a waste material in most of the communities of the household users. Supporting John in this way means assisting to reduce the cutting of trees for firewood and making of charcoal for cooking hence reducing deforestation in the stove user communities. John is grateful to all his micro lenders for their great support and kindness.\n \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3437.5,"image":{"id":1700884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase metal plates in bulk for manufacturing clean cook stoves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Cape Coast","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.1 -1.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2014-09-30T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-30T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":4125,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":207.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":13500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:05:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611730415},{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624168182},{"amount":326.34,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.41,"payment_id":636153989},{"amount":314.8,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":28.95,"payment_id":649508938},{"amount":286.87,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":56.88,"payment_id":664990600},{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681285465},{"amount":308.92,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.83,"payment_id":696495150},{"amount":309.69,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.06,"payment_id":711405621},{"amount":325.92,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.83,"payment_id":730926033},{"amount":326.34,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.41,"payment_id":752017082}],"funded_date":"2014-10-01T21:38:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":771920,"name":"Sandra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sandra is nineteen years old and is married.

Her husband is an army regiment pensioner and is now engaged in paddy field work while her only daughter teaches students at home as a private tutor to earn her pocket money. Lamlhing weaves traditional wraparounds to sustain her family. She underwent a major operation, so she stopped weaving for some time due to the post operation effects. After recovering fully, she started weaving again to generate income mostly to pay her debts for the operation and household requirements. \u201cThe family financial condition was never worse before the operation,\u201d she said. She cannot produce like before since her strength is weaker than it was before the operation. So she weaves slowly and takes a break often. Now that she has more gaps in-between her weaving, she wanted to weave in the evenings to make her work faster. She wanted to continue her weaving at night for longer hours to speed up her work. However, her work had been affected by the irregular power supply and she could not work as desired. After sunset, her work was affected by the insufficient illumination, which led her to access a Kiva loan to buy a solar home lighting system, which is an excellent option to promote her production and at the same time, save extra expenditures on candle sticks, kerosene, etc. By availing the mini solar lighting system loan, she is now able to weave in the evenings like she wanted.

She is not married and has three children, one schooling, and the rest are grown. She has been supporting her family by managing a food business known as a mamalishe. She started her business from down level, selling only snacks. After Kiva's support, she managed to rent a room, operating full-time and serving breakfast and lunch foods. \r\n\r\nWith this progress, Sarah's income rose, and it became easier to afford the cost of her family\u2019s welfare. She is so happy and thankful for Kiva's support. Sara's mind and ideas are still opening, and she wants to start selling women's products: handbags and dresses. Her desire is to grow her businesses and life. Sarah has been in her business for six years, and works from 6:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. daily. She is able to realize a very good return.\r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, this is her third credit request to be apportioned among Azimio Kichemchem, a four-member group. The group members will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan. \r\n\r\nShe used her previous credits, since repaid, to make business progress from snacks to a mamalishe business. She received extra income, which she used to buy a plot and to start building, and covered school fees and welfare costs.\r\n\r\nSarah will invest her loan to start selling women\u2019s products such as handbags, dresses, etc. She is so thankful for everyone who has supported and keeps on supporting them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1701293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She was born and raised in a rural area and has been working in the fields since she was a child, growing vegetables and looking after livestock. She has been raising livestock on her own land for the past 10 years. She milks her five cows every morning and then sells the milk at the market. She doesn't do all of this work alone - her husband and children help her take care of the cattle too.\r\n\r\nAnimal husbandry is the primary source of income for Halichabegim's family, and she works very hard so her children aren't in need of anything.

In the past three years she has acquired quite a lot of experience in retail and has regular customers whom she values very much and whose needs she tries to satisfy.

She is a vendor at a street market, and she sells various goods on a retail basis, such as socks, underwear, scarves and many other small items.  In the winter, things get very difficult for her.  The weather gets very cold and it is hard and painful to stand in the open air.  For this reason, Somina is now dealing with health issues, but she doesn't have the money nor the time to get medical treatment.  Her income is not sufficient: it only allows her to buy food and pay the utilities.  Her son sends her the extra money that she needs for medication, from Russia.

And they know one another through tontines in the district and through their revenue-generating businesses. The group members run different revenue-generating businesses, especially selling fabrics and secondhand clothing. \r\n\r\nConcerned about expanding their businesses, the women had decided to turn to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their second solidarity loan. \r\n\r\nMs. Awa (the woman standing at the far right in the photo) is famous for selling Wax \u2019pagnes\u2019 (the colorful cloth of western Africa) of superior qualities. She intends to use her loan to purchase 25 lengths of Wax \u2018pagne\u2019 cloth. She gets her supplies in Djicoroni. She operates her business with cash and sells to women customers in Djicoroni.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Awa hopes to make an average monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be used to support herself. The rest will be used in her business. Her goal is to enhance loyalty in this Soro Yiriwaso partnership, so as to take advantage of many loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1699628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-10-01T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-31T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malado                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":102058.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793545},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":102058.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758414},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":102058.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319002},{"amount":194.8,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":102058.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.2,"payment_id":610752764},{"amount":194.8,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-03T11:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":102058.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.2,"payment_id":610752765},{"amount":179.65,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-14T11:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":102058.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.35,"payment_id":624542545}],"funded_date":"2014-10-08T10:10:28Z","paid_date":"2015-04-14T11:01:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":775241,"name":"Jimmy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jimmy, 48 years old, is married and a resident of Calamba, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

By hawking, she makes her sales retail to a customer base composed mostly of women in Kanadjiguila.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Bah hopes to make an average monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used for reinvesting in her business and ensuring her children are cared for at home. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":1699636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kanadjiguila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-10-01T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-31T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":86.2,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia                                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":395.84,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":201990.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793547},{"amount":395.84,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":201990.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758416},{"amount":395.83,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":201990.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319004},{"amount":385.54,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":201990.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.29,"payment_id":610752767},{"amount":355.55,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":201990.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":40.28,"payment_id":624542547},{"amount":360.2,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":201990.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.63,"payment_id":636515593}],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T14:28:51Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":775302,"name":"Philomena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philomena is a single woman and owns a house that has piped water but not electricity.

She spends most of her time grazing because she is too concerned about animal health and feed intake to let anyone else do it. \r\n\r\nMary is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES from Kiva lenders to purchase a water tank. Water is essential for life and it's the nutrient needed by dairy animals in the largest quantity for their body functions, temperature control and in the production of milk. By having a water tank, her animals will have 24 hour access to this invaluable resource. Most rural farmers time when their cattle should take water and that is when they lead them to a spring. Limitations in the availability of clean, fresh, and high-quality water for dairy animals can limit milk production quicker than a deficiency in any other nutrient. Water intake also regulates feed intake.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, Mary will avoid this mistake.

Looking for a source of income for her family, she started to get involved in agriculture and animal husbandry ten years ago.  Thanks to her very hard work and constant labor, she has greatly improved her business and she now makes up to 10,000 som (KGS) per month, primarily from the sale of milk.  She currently owns one dairy cow as well as 0.5 hectare of arable land and a 0.12 hectare garden with fruit trees.  She has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase a dairy cow.  This purchase will allow her to produce and sell larger volumes of milk, as there is a high demand for milk among the local residents.  She plans to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further developing her small business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1701366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase one dairy cow in order to produce and sell larger volumes of organic milk.

Her sales are made retail to a customer base composed mostly of women in Badialan III.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Mariam plans on making an average monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA that will be used for reinvesting in her business and for meeting the sundry needs at home. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1699649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase commercially produced clothing (for children) of the best qualities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-10-01T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-31T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":29.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":68038.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793551},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:25:01Z","rounded_local_amount":68038.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758420},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":68038.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319008},{"amount":129.87,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":68038.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.46,"payment_id":610752771},{"amount":119.77,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":68038.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.56,"payment_id":624542551},{"amount":121.33,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":68038.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12,"payment_id":636515597}],"funded_date":"2014-10-09T06:23:27Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":775306,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is a 29-year-old married woman and mother of three children from Ajuy, Iloilo.

And they know one another through tontines in the district and through their revenue-generating businesses. The group members have businesses, such as the selling of secondhand clothing, juice drinks, condiments, and Wax \u2019pagnes\u2019 (the colorful cloth of western Africa). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing their business capital, the group members had decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their third solidarity loan. \r\n\r\nMs. Oumou (the woman sitting second from the left in the photo) is a famous for selling secondhand clothing in Niomirambougou. She intends to use her loan to purchase 2 bales of secondhand clothing. She gets her supplies in M\u00e9dine. Her sales are made retail to a customer base composed mostly of women in Niomirambougou.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Oumou plans on making an average monthly profit of 35,000 francs CFA that will be used for meeting her children\u2019s sundry needs. The rest will be invested in her business. She is counting a lot on this Soro Yiriwaso partnership to achieve her goals, which include expanding her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1699651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase secondhand clothing \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-10-01T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-31T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidiatou                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85048.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793552},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":85048.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758421},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":85048.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319009},{"amount":162.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":85048.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.33,"payment_id":610752772},{"amount":149.7,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":85048.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.96,"payment_id":624542552},{"amount":151.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":85048.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15,"payment_id":636515598}],"funded_date":"2014-10-21T23:21:46Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":775342,"name":"Mbetsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbetsa is a married woman with five kids, all of whom attend school.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Akyz has started to harvest the beans, but she doesn't have the resources to finish, so she applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank in order to hire workers and rent equipment to harvest the beans. She will use her profits to continue investing in her business and to buy a car for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1701392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To hire workers to harvest organic beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-01T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-31T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":113.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":811.22,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50568.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":113.78,"payment_id":730933324}],"funded_date":"2014-10-06T14:42:35Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:56:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":771037,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is married and has two children, both of whom go to school.

","en":"William, 25, lives with his spouse and his two children, ages 1 and 8, in a town near the city of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHe has a business where he has earned a living selling fast food since 2012.  He shaped his business plan since he worked in a fast food store, where he learned everything he knows today.  Wanting to be independent, he got the money together little by little and started his own entrepreneurial venture.\r\n\r\nHis business is located in a place where he accepts cash for hot dogs, corn products, hamburgers, and other delicacies that he combines very well with delicious sauces that he himself makes.  His work day starts at 2 in the afternoon and ends at 12 midnight, Monday through Sunday.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to open new locales to increase his coverage and ultimately be able to buy a house for his family's benefit.  His greatest challenge is insufficient working capital to achieve his goal quickly.\r\n\r\nCurrently he's applying for a Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He's going to buy a pizza oven and make improvements on his space.  With this investment, he'll respond to demand and add a new product.  This will add additional income, which will make his Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1698206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is an enthusiastic and optimistic woman. She is 48-year-old woman from a small village of Dhupguri in the district of Jalpaiguri. She has six children, and is raising them after facing a lot of difficulties. She lost her husband a few years back. At that time, her children were so young that her main challenge was to do something to look after her children and provide them with their basic needs.   \n\nThus, she chose livestock breeding as her profession. Now two of her children are students, three sons are unemployed, and one is working as a worker for house painting. Krisna has been actively involved in livestock business for the many of the last years. She purchases baby goats, raises them, and sells them in the market when they are grown up. For additional income she also sells milk to her neighbors. \n\nHowever, income from this source is not enough to take good care of a family of six children.\n\nThus Krisna is seeking a loan from the Kiva lenders (field partner BJS) to purchase goats. The goats will produce more milk that Krisna will use to fill the demand in the marketplace in order to generate more income to run her huge family. Her biggest challenge is lack of capital. \n\nShe wants to expand her business activity to widen her existing portfolio to generate additional income to meet her children's education needs and her reinvestment needs.\n\nShe is thankful to her lenders.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1697055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase goats for her animal husbandry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-01T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-10-31T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Krisna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-01T20:14:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":772188,"name":"Huoykaominnoy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phet's village takes water from wells and from the local streams.

Parveen provides sewing services and earns an income to contribute to managing the household with her husband.\r\n \r\nParveen needs different kinds of goods such as needles, thread, fabric, and machine oil for her business, but due to insufficient financial means she is unable to purchase these items. Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan through its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase these items and will help her to increase her monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.\r\n\r\nParveen is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1699393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

She is married and lives in a small village in Akhmeta district, Kakheti region with her two children and pensioner parents. In spite of having a university degree, Irine is still unemployed. In the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. So, Irine decided to start her own business with a loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Irine\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn't satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program, that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of 450 Gel, she will purchase all the needed equipment and work as a stylist. She will offer different styles of hair cuts, hair styles and so on to her clients. Irine is very motivated to be involved in this business and to generate her own income in order to improve the living conditions for her

He is the sole breadwinner of the family. His salary is not enough to cover all the expenses of the family. Yahaya's house lacks many home appliances, and most of the ones it has are very old. In fact, Yahya's wife can't stand these miserable conditions. Unfortunately, her husband doesn't have enough money to purchase new home appliances for the house.\n\nFor this reason, Yahya is requesting a loan of 120,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase home appliances as new; cooking pots, spoons, glasses and some other simple home appliances for his house.

Even though some people in the village, including Hienthong, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases the disposable income available to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. Hienthong and other filter users also decrease the amount of money spent to boil water by purchasing less charcoal and decreasing the time spent foraging for firewood. \r\n\r\nHienthong's filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most users find the filter works from 3-5 years.

She studied up to ninth grade. Then, because of the war, she was forced to migrate to the city. It is there where she took and managed to complete a cake baking course. Now she is back in her community and bakes delicious cakes.\r\n\r\nShe is married. Her husband makes a living as a builder, almost on a full-time basis. They have three children, of whom only two (a boy and a girl) go to high school.\r\n\r\nShe spends most of her time being a homemaker and bakes cakes on the side\u2014almost only to order. She learned the trade approximately 15 years ago.

Therefore, Parveen has requested a loan so that, along with the contribution of savings, her son can buy a new rickshaw.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that now her son will be able to generate more income because now he will not pay daily rent to anyone.

Then she decided to start tailoring work at home and since then she has been sewing clothes for her community. She wants to enhance the beauty of her craft so she would like to buy a Juki sewing machine. The professionals use this machine for tailoring because of its speed and fine performance.\r\n\r\nShe knows the techniques of tailoring very well. Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives and the local community.

She and her husband have three children.\r\n\r\nShe has introduced a specific syllabus requiring specific books for her school, as she wants to deliver extra curriculum knowledge through teaching. Some of these books are not easily available in local book shops. Therefore, Josphine has decided to sell the books through the school stationery shop. However, due to lack of money, she finds it difficult to buy the books she needs to offer. Therefore, she has applied for a loan. This will allow her to offer the needed schoolbooks to her students. \r\n\r\nShe is hopeful for a better future for her students and wishes to serve as a role model for many in the

household items, cases of water, soda, and various other juices in bulk and individually. Only 24 years old, Ritanjali supports a family of five, including her husband, her parents-in-law, and a two-year-old kid. Transportation of drinks always poses a problem for Ritanjali. Drivers charge a high amount, as the area of Boudh district is difficult, and it can often be difficult to find willing drivers in the first place.\r\n\r\nRitanjali is full of business savvy, however, and overcomes her transportation challenges by befriending drivers that she can call upon later. She has gained a loyal clientele by being welcoming and continues to grow her business by handing out business cards with her contact information for customers to pass along. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, Ritanjali joined the People's Forum.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

But today, she stands as a testimony to the fact that there is no lack of opportunities for those who are willing to work hard. She works as a dairy farmer and runs her own milk-selling business. Her neighbors are her main clients.\r\n\r\nSahena's husband Antaj is a green grocer at a local market. He is hardly able to cover the food expenses of the family. By running her own business, Sahena is able to support her family and save for a secure future.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a household of four, their current monthly income will not be enough.
