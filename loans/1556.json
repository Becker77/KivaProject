She has a small stall in her house where, three days a week, she makes and sells salchichas [sausages] and the delicious hornado de chancho [slow-roasted pork] that her clients crave so much. She also sells water in large containers, fizzy drinks, and several other products in her stall, which helps her to generate greater revenue. She also prepares meals and bocadillos [could refer to either filled baguettes or fruit-filled pastries] for parties and social engagements. She has had this business for more than 20 years, and it helps her to earn something since her husband doesn\u2019t earn a lot from his work.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use this loan to buy salchichas, pork and other supplies for making her food. She has been with the communal bank for more than 13 years and she likes it because of the help it gives her to get ahead in life. Her dream is to have a great restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1699248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy salchichas (sausages), pork, and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Ana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-10-02T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-01T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1370.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":171.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":687.49,"local_amount":685.24,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":687.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562429572},{"amount":343.74,"local_amount":342.62,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":343.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579565258},{"amount":343.77,"local_amount":342.64,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":343.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595162497}],"funded_date":"2014-10-02T02:54:04Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T12:52:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eloise Minogue","image":null}},{"id":773156,"name":"Amelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meljun is 17 years old and is studying to earn a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

Cecilia recognizes that she needs a little technical orientation and has assisted to some of the workshops Ecoblock gives. She has  finally saved some money to finish what she started years ago and is ready to finish the upstairs room and build the staircase. Cecilia has an informal job and makes around $800 USD a month. Given this, she is not able to go to traditional banks for a credit. Cecilia is asking for a credit to buy the construction materials to start building.

the rural communities in the Twifo lower Denkyira District in the Central Region of Ghana. Sarah is the group leader. She is 48 years old and married with four children. Her children are 28, 25, 20 and 12 years old and are all in school. She earns additional income from the sale of bread to individuals. The stoves use virgin pellets (Palm Kennel Shells), which are easily available as waste materials within the communities where she operates. There is a high demand for her clean cook stoves, since the clean cook stove improves indoor air quality and the health of the users. Besides, the stove users save on their household expenditures for fuel and no longer walk miles in search of firewood. The benefits of the stove spread by word of mouth in advertising her clean cook stove. Sarah and her group members need this loan to buy more stoves to meet the increasing demand from their customers. Funding her loan will also reduce deforestation within the communities as the stove users will no longer cut the wood from the forest for firewood or to use as charcoal for fuel. Sarah and her group members thank all their micro lenders for their generosity and help in saving the forest within their business

Juana, or Juanita, as people call her, is serious and also very responsible. She is 30 years old and married to Arturo and over the years has had a family with three children who are in school. While her husband works as a laborer in construction of houses or in the fields, Juanita has a  corn mill. Every morning she gets up at 5:00 am to start her service for people in her community. In this place, like in many other parts of Mexico, people make tortillas by hand, and to do that it is necessary to prepare the corn in a mill like Juanita's. \u201cBecause of the good clientele with the mill, I decided to  start selling groceries a month ago\u201d. That is how now she has two sources of income. Juanita is very grateful to KIVA and VisionFund Mexico because thanks to the loans, she has been able to start her grocery store. With the new loan, she will buy grocery products such as milk, eggs, bread, sugar, beverages, and canned products, items that sell the most. With her income, Juanita has the possibility of paying for some household expenses and for her children's education. She dreams of having a great grocery store where she can offer a wide variety of merchandise. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group will invest in her businesses: Miguel and Claudia will invest in their sheep and Domitila will buy more grocery products.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken on the stairs of the kiosk of the town where the members live. Juanita is wearing a brown jacket.*"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1698039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more grocery products.

Her primary income sources are tea, vegetables, bananas, a job salary, and profits from a small-time personal business.\r\n\r\nJosphine is seeking a loan to purchase modern farming implements. She realized that she is working increasingly longer and harder on her farm. The work women in the area are currently doing on the farm was previously male tasks. They have been forced to take over as their husbands migrate to find wage labour in urban areas. Therefore, the tools women use are of great importance for improving productivity and yields, and reducing time and physical effort.

This is very tough and dangerous work. \r\n\r\nHer first daughter is in grade 2 and the second one is in kindergarten. They are too small and she doesn't want them to work hard, but wants them to concentrate on studying. For that reason, she never stops working to provide a better life for her children. Indeed, she has taken her second loan with Anh Chi Em Program to buy pigs and pig feed after reaping the benefits from the first loan along with the training sessions about pigs. She hopes she could even be more successful with breeding pigs this time so that she would have more cash for other farming investments and afford to buy new furniture for the house as well as provide the best conditions for her family. \r\n\r\nIn the picture, Thom is smiling and stands first from the

rural village called Biripali of Balangir district in Odisha, India. This group was formed in the year 2014 to avail themselves of loans from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their existing businesses. \r\n\r\nJamuna, a simple and confident lady, hails from a poor family living below the poverty line. She is the one in the group who is standing third from left in the photo with a raised hand. She is 32 years old and lives with her husband.\r\n \r\nJamuna has been running a Tiffin (light meals) stall for the last 10 years in her village with the hand-holding support of her husband. Jamuna prepares items like samosas, wada, potato chup, etc. Her stall is very popular due to her good quality items. \r\n\r\nShe starts her Tiffin stall at 8 a.m. in the morning and closes at 6 p.m. in the evening. Due to the rural base, she earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from her Tiffin stall.  With this small income, she is hardly able to manage her household expenses. \r\n\r\nJamuna has a dream of constructing a house and purchasing a bike, but due to lack of finances, she is not being able to materialize it, so she wants to expand her business with the present loan of 16,000 INR. She plans to purchase more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc., to increase the items as well as quantity of Tiffin. \r\n\r\nShe hopes this will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she has to replenish her stock frequently from the nearest market, which is 8 kilometers away. Jamuna hopes to save enough to construct a permanent cabin for her Tiffin stall and construct a house of her own to be a prestigious woman of her village.\r\n\r\nThe other 10 members of the group are also doing various micro enterprises like puffed rice businesses, vegetable cultivation and vending, fruit stalls, tea and Tiffin stalls, general stores, dry food vending, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1701798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BIRIPALI, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-10-02T13:50:35Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-01T13:50:35Z","loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhumisuta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Budhubari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dropadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gitanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mungana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taruni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tarusila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":176000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":176000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":775747,"name":"Alapama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alapama is a 36-year-old married woman with five children.

children. He lives in a rural area and has his own minivan taxi, with which he transports passengers and baggage. Sometimes he works the night shift as well, in order to bring in more income.\r\n\r\nLutfullo works hard to feed his family and save toward his children's education.

One of Fransisco\u2019s grand aspirations is to be able to make many larger sales and to have an income with which to repair his home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1699798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-10-02T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-01T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1.47,"local_amount":10.68,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T10:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":11.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561554996},{"amount":4.85,"local_amount":35.25,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579463939},{"amount":0.3,"local_amount":2.18,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070612},{"amount":5.54,"local_amount":40.32,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":42.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612113595},{"amount":5.71,"local_amount":41.55,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":44.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624776856},{"amount":57.42,"local_amount":417.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":443.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134165},{"amount":7.45,"local_amount":54.16,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":57.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489293},{"amount":4.84,"local_amount":35.19,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":37.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664971719},{"amount":106.87,"local_amount":777.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":824.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267262},{"amount":5.87,"local_amount":42.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":45.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711384783},{"amount":74.68,"local_amount":543.18,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":576.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731214927}],"funded_date":"2014-10-03T18:48:28Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:14:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She works hard to augment their income to help meet her family\u2019s daily personal and household needs. \r\n\r\nAnnaliza operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales, she is requesting a Php 11,000 loan.  She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. \r\n\r\nShe is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God, and you, in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nAnnaliza hopes to have a bigger store to grow her business so she could send all her school children to college.  She dreams to give them a bright future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1702073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married to Antonio, a farmer, and they have four children. Three are already married, and their youngest is still in high school. She manages her own household while operating the business.  She works hard to augment their income to meet her family\u2019s daily personal and household needs. \r\n\r\nPriscila operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also earns income from the farm of vegetables that her husband works on. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan.  She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business.  She is thanking God, and you, in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n \r\nPriscila hopes to be able to grow her business and improve her store so she could send her youngest to college. She prays to live long and stay healthy.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1702074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-02T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-01T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.36,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5392.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625465},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2696.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535606},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2022.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595133953}],"funded_date":"2014-10-02T17:43:10Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":775799,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is 58 years old and married with seven children.\r\n\r\nLorna works hard to provide for her family.

Two years ago, Elodia established a shop in her home that sells paper products. It occupies a large room. In addition, her store sells gifts and some other articles. Elodia says she has seen her business grow little by little and despite the fact that her sales are not so significant, the paper shop is profitable. With the object of increasing her income, seven months ago Elodia also began selling tacos on weekends. Her earnings are invested in the educational expenses of one of her daughters, who, despite the fact that she is now an adult, still depends on her mother's help. Additionally, Elodia wishes to purchase more inputs in order to continue preparing tacos and to supply other articles for her paper shop.\r\n\r\nElodia wants to invest her loan in a variety of colored paper products sought by customers from her locality to make decorations, including crowns, for popular celebrations of the Day of the Dead.

She quickly fell in love with the creativity involved in soap-making, and found a great deal of satisfaction in the idea that selling her natural soaps was akin to spreading her own personal brand of joy throughout the community.\r\n\r\nAs a young entrepreneur, Jacqueline faced several challenges including writing a business plan, planning inventory purchases and other expenses, and building an active client base using word of mouth and other marketing methods. Not one to be deterred, she soldiered on and now is in a better position than ever to grow her business into a self-sustaining profit engine.\r\n\r\nJacqueline will use her Kiva loan to purchase supplies for the holiday season including inventory, mugs, and other promotional items.

","en":"Fariza is 39 years old. She has a secondary education. Fariza has been involved in animal husbandry for 5 years. She raises cows and bulls in the backyard of her home. Fariza lives in the town of Tursun-zoda with her husband, children and father. Her husband currently works in Russia, just like many men in her town.

She lives with her parents, and two brothers. Anna and her mother work in the local bakery. Anna, with the help of her family members, is breeding livestock including cows, pigs, calves and hens. They are also cultivating potatoes and barley. Livestock breeding and plant cultivation are very important sources of income for the family. To be able to continue, Anna needs a loan of USD 2,500 to purchase seeds for land cultivation (wheat, barley and potatoes) and forage for feeding the livestock. Anna has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Anna was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Anna and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1284,"image":{"id":1702146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She was born and raised in a rural area. Mamlakat is a teacher by profession. Her husband is a bus driver and makes trips to the Russian Federation. Her work as a teacher does not yield enough money for Mamlakat and this is why she has an additional source of income - she sells women's and children's clothing. Mamlakat knows that at the present time it is impossible to get a good job without an education. She wants her children to live in abundance. Mamlakat has a daughter, who was accepted to a university this year. There were not many available budget seats, and this is why her daughter had to be accepted on a commercial basis and pay for her education. Mamlakat currently does not have the necessary amount to pay for the education and came to MDO Arvand for the financial support. Mamlakat thanks MDO Arvand for the support and trust in advance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1685608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Boljang Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The featured borrower of the group, Chinkholhing, is a 50-year-old woman pictured with her hand raised. Her husband is a retired pastor and they sustain their family from his pension salary. She weaves traditional wraparounds to supplement their income as her husband's salary is not sufficient for the household needs. Their eldest son with his wife is in a seminary supported by sponsors from the church while their second son is a private tutor at home who earns income to manage his college fees and their third son is a college student supported by his parents. Their daily activities after sunset have so much to do with the irregular power supply in the evening as the area undergoes power cuts frequently. It hampers their activities including weaving by the mother, tutor classes by the second son and other household activities. Their activities become less productive due to the insufficient power supply and they have to bear the consequences and limit their activities under the light from one candle in a room. From time to time, Chinkholhing weaves colourful traditional wraparound skirts to sell to retailers for more profit. After all the household chores are done, she wanted to continue weaving by extending her workday into the evening hours. However, the power supply is very irregular in the area. One has to pay an expensive amount to install prepaid electricity in the house. Hence, after sunset due to insufficient light, she could not continue her income-generating activities.\r\n\r\nAs luck had its way, they came across WSDS where they can avail a mini solar home lighting system with affordable interest. The family is very happy to avail such a loan from WSDS and expressed their immense gratitude to the lenders. Therefore, with the assistance of her Kiva loan, she wants to buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system, which will light four bulbs for 12 hours a day. This will help her to increase her productivity and allow her business to operate during the night. Chinkholhing believes that a solar home lighting system is an excellent option to give in-house illumination in areas with frequent power cuts. They can now perform their daily activities under the bright light without any difficulty. Likewise, the rest of the group members also need solar home lighting systems for their income-generating activities and family use. Most of them weave different texture and patterns of traditional wraparounds and shawls for income generation."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1700441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-10-02T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-01T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chinkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dimhat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngailam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingngaikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinngainiang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":109557,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109557}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-05T17:09:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":774282,"name":"Urania Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Urania de 48 a\u00f1os de edad habita en vivienda propia junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus 2 hijos de 6 y 11 a\u00f1os de edad.

located in Boudh district of Odisha, India. There are ten enthusiastic ladies in the group. Brundabati is the president of the group. She is 35 years old, married, and has three years of formal education. \r\n\r\nSome years ago, she began a food-selling business that was soon transformed into a restaurant. Due to her hard work and what she has learned from the People's Forum trainings, Brundabati has been very successful. As she was unable to handle the workload in the restaurant by herself, she employed a workforce of two to help her, and her husband also helps her. \r\n\r\nBrundabati, along with her group, is requesting a loan. She will use her portion to purchase essential items for the restaurant, including an additional stove, pots, and dishes.

She is an enterprising woman who wants to succeed in life.  She does not let obstacles stop her in life, since she has reached all her goals and dreams.  She gets up every day to work and only has her income to improve her family's living conditions.  Antonia is the first one on the left in the photograph.\r\n\r\nShe earns money by growing maxan [leaves for wrapping tamales] in the community where she lives.  Her parents taught her this work five years ago.  She sells her products in the market and the area around her community.  This allows her to improve her family's living conditions.  \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to maintain her crops so that she can grow more maxan in her community.  It is important to her that her maxan plants produce leaves of the best quality so that she does not lose customers.\r\n\r\nShe has become a great example in her community, so a group of women decided to join with Antonia to plant maxan so that they will also have adequate living conditions in the future. Her aspirations are to plant more maxan and to see her siblings get a good education and become professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1699945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to
