The distance from home to school is about 10 miles. Every day after my activities at my school I do housework to help my parents. My parents are farmers, but do not get work every day, because it depends on the weather and natural conditions in the village. Due to unpredictable conditions, the economic circumstances of my parents has declined, and my father now works in the city of Bogor as a handyman (to make brown sugar), even though my parents income is not fixed. However, the results of tapping is enough to help the economy. I followed the program to get a Kiva loan for education expenses in order to ease the burden on my parents.

For Joseph, the father of one boy and three girls, he has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. His primary source of income has been selling eggs, tea and milk, and some personal business he engages in to supplement his meager income. \r\n\r\nJoseph passionately loves poultry farming and feeding his poultry makes him very proud. Waking up every day in the morning to collect eggs from his poultry makes him feel fulfilled. Although this humble father makes a profit through selling poultry, the biggest challenge he faces is meeting the demand of the market that is available. He is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, which is an institution that serves poor, small-landholding farmers, Joseph has acquired both financial and technical training.

Meet Erick, a 30-year-old husband and father to three good-looking children. He is based in Kimulot, a remote village in the Litein area of Kenya, which is an area with high poultry production and consumption. \r\n\r\nFor five years he has been actively involved in mixed farming as a source of income. He has a beautiful and supporting wife who helps him with his farm work and domestic chores. His primary source of income is from milk, tea and some personal business that he does to make ends meet. He passionately loves poultry farming and this can be noticed in how he takes good care of his poultry birds and feeds them. When asked what he enjoys about poultry farming he replied that he enjoys \u201cpicking the eggs every day in the morning.\u201d \r\n\r\nHowever, this humble and honest man faces challenges of not meeting the demand for eggs and also not satisfying his ever-increasing client base. That is why he is requesting a loan - to buy good quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture and the demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for so many people. Other than increased profits he will benefit from poultry manure hence saving more money that could have been used in buying fertilizer. Through increased income from eggs, selling poultry meat and feathers, he will permanently change his living conditions and secure the future of his school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1702796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy good quality breeds of poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-03T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-02T05:20:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.1,"local_amount":1808.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1881.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194308},{"amount":27.63,"local_amount":2368.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2464.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823625},{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":4493.42,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264252},{"amount":26.27,"local_amount":2251.96,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2343.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458960},{"amount":28.47,"local_amount":2527.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.01,"payment_id":681377304},{"amount":28.18,"local_amount":2518.55,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.2,"payment_id":696587070},{"amount":27.84,"local_amount":2562.56,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.06,"payment_id":711505326},{"amount":127.2,"local_amount":11469.83,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11936.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.62,"payment_id":731022188}],"funded_date":"2014-10-21T20:31:17Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":776150,"name":"Jason","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After you\u2019ve met with Jason and his wife, Amber, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve gotten an education on the possibilities for environmentally sustainable landscaping.

Meet Patrick from Bungoma, Kenya, who is a man from a community not known for farming (Luo), but he is earning a living through agriculture. He is happily married and together with his wife is blessed with five lovely children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 2 years, he has been practicing mixed farming, and because of his experience he commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. Income from milk, eggs, and running a posho mill have allowed him to earn a decent living. To make the extra coin, he also engages in small personal business. \r\n\r\nPatrick passionately loves dairy farming and the animals on his farm have been given names. Milking and feeding 'Browny' (the name of his cow) makes him very proud. Through milk selling, he has had quite good returns and demand for milk has been growing. He uses his mobile phone a lot, firstly to receive orders from customers, and then to send an SMS to them when the milk is ready for collection. Because of using ICT he has had a competitive edge in his dairy business.\r\n\r\nDemand has been overwhelming and he now needs another cow to fully satisfy demand. Therefore he is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Patrick does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow, but he wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will produce between 15-20 litres of milk a day.

La mayor\u00eda de los habitantes siembran ma\u00edz y lim\u00f3n en el patio de su casa o a orillas del cerro ya sea para vender o para autoconsumo. \n\nLas integrantes del grupo son:   \nYolanda- Venta De Refrescos\nAracely- Calzado Por Catalogo\nAidee- Venta De Ilusi\u00f3n\nPrimitiva-Panader\u00eda\nAngelina- Venta De Pan\nFrancisca- Calzado Por Catalogo\nVanessa- Venta De Abarrotes\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Primitiva es casada y tiene un hijo que recientemente se cas\u00f3. Primitiva es muy alegre y trabajadora. Ella est\u00e1 a cargo de una panader\u00eda en la cual se procesan cerca de quince costales de harina al d\u00eda para tener una producci\u00f3n de 2000 piezas de pan (en una temporada de ventas baja). En la panader\u00eda de Primitiva, el pan se prepara en un horno de piedra y con fuego de le\u00f1a, lo que le otorga un sabor muy \u00fanico al producto. Sin embargo, no son s\u00f3lo los ingredientes ni el material lo que hacen a cada pieza algo especial. Los 5 trabajadores siempre escuchan m\u00fasica durante la elaboraci\u00f3n del pan, comentan que tambi\u00e9n es una manera de olvidar un poco todo el calor que se guarda en el lugar. El equipo  de panaderos comienza a trabajar la masa a las 8 am, a las 10 am prenden el horno, a las 11 am introducen las charolas y a las 3 pm se tiene pan de diferentes nombres para que a las 4 pm los 7 repartidores (tambi\u00e9n empleados de Do\u00f1a Primitiva) lleguen con sus canastas para cargar el pan y comenzar a vender en distintas comunidades. \n\nCon el pr\u00e9stamo, Primitiva comprar\u00e1: harina, le\u00f1a, manteca vegetal, az\u00facar, colorante natural, ajonjol\u00ed, queso, bolsas de papel y m\u00e1s charolas, pues los tiempos de lluvia se aproximan y con ellos una mayor demanda de pan.\n\nEl grupo da las gracias a VisionFund M\u00e9xico por otorgarles una nueva oportunidad para crecer, incrementar sus ganancias y otorgar una mejor calidad de vida a sus familias. \n\n*En la imagen: Primitiva viste de blusa rosada y esta parada detr\u00e1s de la joven de blusa blanca.\n","en":"The Maguey Group consists of seven women members who live in a community surrounded by sugarcane plantations.  In the afternoons, the youth get together to play volleyball and the lottery.  Most of the locals grow corn and lemon in the backyard of their houses at the foot of the mountain.  They either sell their crops or use them for home consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are:   \r\nYolanda- Softdrink sales\r\nAracely- Shoes by catalogue\r\nAidee- Lingerie sales\r\nPrimitiva- Bakery\r\nAngelina- Bread sales\r\nFrancisca- Shoes by catalogue\r\nVanessa- Grocery sales\r\n\r\nPrimitiva is married and has a son who recently got married.  She is very cheerful and hard-working, and runs a bakery which processes around 15 costals of flour a day to produce 2,000 loaves of bread (in the low season).  In Priscilla's bakery the bread is baked in a stone oven with firewood which gives it a unique flavor.  However it is not only the ingredients or method used to make each special loaf.  The five employees listen to music while they make the bread.  They claim it is also a way to forget about the heat where they work.  The bread team begins making the dough at 8:00 a.m. and at 10:00 a.m. they fire the oven.  At 11:00 a.m. they put in the trays and at 3:00 p.m. they have different types of bread prepared for the delivery people to pick up at 4:00 p.m. (Primitiva also employs these people).  They fill their baskets with bread and start selling it in different communities.\r\n\r\nPrimitiva will use the loan to buy flour, firewood, shortening, sugar, natural food coloring, sesame, cheese, paper bags and more trays because the rainy season is approaching and there will be more demand for bread.\r\n\r\nThe group is grateful to VisionFund M\u00e9xico for giving them this new opportunity to grow, increase their earnings and give their families a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n* In the photograph, Primitiva is the one wearing a pink top and standing behind a young woman in a white top.

George, 65, is a mixed farmer from Bungoma, a rural town in Kenya. He has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. This hardworking father of six earns his livelihood through selling milk, crops and some personal business he engages in when harvests are low. He passionately loves poultry farming, and rearing chickens is his hobby. Every day he wakes up in the morning to collect eggs and feed his chickens, and he finds this very fulfilling. Neighbors have been flocking to his compound to buy eggs and through word of mouth, news has spread like fire in the whole village that he has quality eggs. The demand is so high, he cannot fully satisfy it. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan he will be able to satisfy the demand, and this will translate to increased income levels. Through Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, George believes that small-scale farmers like him will be able to benefit from financial solutions. Poultry meat is a very popular meal among many people in his village, and this translates to improved income and better living standards. George will sell eggs for commercial purposes and for home consumption. Increased income will allow George to provide nothing but the best for his family and improve his living conditions. Other than profits, he will benefit from poultry manure and poultry feathers, which will help improve his life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":264.97,"image":{"id":1702855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

region of Kenya. He has been doing this work for the last six years to provide for his family of three children. His primary income sources are milk and crops.\r\n\r\nReuben enjoys farming a lot. Looking after his cattle, however, is quickly becoming a serious challenge. His cattle stray from time to time from the designated grazing area into other people's farms. The consequences of this can be very severe, leading to disputes which can escalate to violence and hostility. \r\n\r\nReuben is seeking a loan to pay for a fencing wire to fence his farmland.\r\n\r\nThe $25 dollar loan you make will enable Reuben to have small paddocks created by fencing to make stocking more intensive. The paddocks will also be spelled to build up feed supply, which will also force the stock to graze a wider range of plants, and allows the plants to recover after grazing. The fence will also protect his crops from pests such as hares. \r\n\r\nWhen asked how the loan would benefit his family, he replied, \"Improves security in my compound, improves stock management, and keeps my neighbours happy.\" \t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1702790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to fence his farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-03T11:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-02T11:10:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.04,"local_amount":3381.7,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3393.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680887},{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":3236.85,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3248.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625172},{"amount":37.01,"local_amount":3289.46,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3300.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194307},{"amount":36.04,"local_amount":3203.31,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3214.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823624},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":3492.76,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3504.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262154},{"amount":39.56,"local_amount":3516.25,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3528.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264251},{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":3541.55,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3553.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600445},{"amount":42.24,"local_amount":3754.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3767.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458959},{"amount":136.71,"local_amount":12583.77,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":12627.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.86,"payment_id":681377303}],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T08:05:32Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":776175,"name":"Concepcion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of six children, Concepcion works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from raising pigs.

Duncan is 62 years of age, ever smiling, and one of the most hardworking men in his village of Kutus, in the area of Kerugoya in Kenya. He has a wife and five children, and wanted to lay a good foundation for his family and grandchildren to come. That is why he started farming and has been practicing mixed farming for the past 36 years. His primary sources of income have been eggs, crops, and some personal business that he does so as to accumulate more wealth. \r\n\r\nDuncan is very passionate about dairy farming and, as he always says, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart.\u201d He has nicknamed his dairy cow \u201cWamweru.\u201d Dairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth, and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed. This has translated to increased earnings for farmers. Duncan, being a very hardworking and visionary farmer, will want to take advantage of the ready market; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to buy a good-quality breed of dairy cow. Duncan has already decided what type of dairy breed he requires and, because of his immense knowledge on preparing hay, his cows will have plenty of food and will produce more milk. \r\n\r\nDuncan projects that the cow he acquires through the loan will be producing more than 10 liters a day. Because there is a ready market for milk, he does not worry too much about competition, and marketing the milk will not be a challenge. He will be selling it directly to the market as well as to big dairy-processing firms, which will result in increased earnings.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Duncan has planned that instead of selling the milk in its raw form, he will be packaging the milk, and this will also improve his income. Profits from selling milk will enable Duncan to be very successful. He also plans that through accumulated profits, he will be able to construct a biogas digester to produce energy that he will use in cooking and other domestic chores."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1702894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Animal feed plays an important part in the food chain and has implications for the composition and quality of the livestock products (milk, meat and eggs) that his customers consume. A chaff cutter will help in feed preparation for his dairy animals while he will purchase poultry feed straight off the shelves, which will be consumed not only by the poultry existing at his farm, but also the poultry he will acquire with your loan investment. \r\n\r\nJames stated that an increase in income will change the life he is leading with his wife.

Meet Meshack, 44, who lives in his own home that is made out of rustic materials. He has 7 children. He has very good personal and work references in his community, located in the remote village of Bonyamara, Kisii Kenya. Meshack is a farmer with 10 years of experience, specifically in practicing dairy farming. He passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. \r\n\r\nHe is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Profits from milk sales have enabled him to take care of his family, and he has always yearned to have more dairy cows. Accordingly, he is seeking a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. He has already identified the breed of cow that he will buy. The cow will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk daily. This breed of cow will be producing milk referred to as the ideal drinking milk, because it will contain adequate amount of fat and the desirable quantities of protein. This cow will certainly boost milk production on his farm, which will translate to more sales volume and better income for him and his family. Because of this high milk production potential, he will save more money to fully repay the loan. He believes that through careful selection and the application of the strict standard of excellence in keeping his dairy cow, he will have more income which will improve his living standards."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1702936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-03T14:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-02T14:20:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meshack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2208.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2339.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2407.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2477.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2550.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2624.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2701.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2780.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2861.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3031.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.07,"local_amount":4908.75,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4911.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680894},{"amount":26.96,"local_amount":2402.86,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2404.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194319},{"amount":54.73,"local_amount":4878.85,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4881.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823633},{"amount":213.24,"local_amount":19009.54,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":19021.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264259}],"funded_date":"2014-10-03T20:12:46Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":774353,"name":"Nelson Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelson  de 38 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta 4\u00ba grado.

Today, Isaac is 22 years old, married, and has one child. He  provides for his family with the income he earns from crops such as tomato and bananas. In the Kisii community, bananas are very valued. It is a key ingredient in Matoke, the community's staple food.\r\n\r\nIsaac is worried about climate change and what it means for his business. Tomatoes also get affected by diseases. Isaac is requesting a loan to diversify into dairy farming. Dairy production is less reliant on weather. Provided the animals get proper health care, feeds, and water, they will produce milk. This\r\nloan will help Isaac to mitigate risks associated with focusing on crop farming alone. Dairy cows provide a regular source of income since the cows are milked every single day.

He left school to be able to help him.\r\n\r\nHe lives alone in his house, but he has a five year old daughter.  He has to give her monthly payments for her necessities.  He is the only one who lives in his house.\r\n\r\nElmer works in agriculture.  He says that he learned this work thanks to his father, who was engaged in the same business activity.  That is how he acquired experience.  Now he is able to get by on his own through his work.  He works for his expenses, and he also goes to other places to work.  He does this in order to be able to get income, to be able to have what he needs, and to be able to make the monthly payments for his daughter, who does not live with him.  He works Mondays through Saturdays at different places.  He does not have a fixed place because everyone needs his work in order to be able to advance more rapidly with their crops.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to gather the harvests, to de-kernel the corn, to gather the bean harvest, and to be able to store his harvest.\r\n\r\nElmer\u2019s dream is to continue his education, to have a better job, to be able to repair his house or build a new one, and to be able to help his daughter with her education and with the necessities she asks him for.   This way he will be able to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1700067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is in his second year of studies at the Tajikistan National University, majoring in pharmacy. Behruz loves his future profession and, thus, studies at the university with a lot of interest and diligence. His annual university tuition costs a little over 1000 US dollars.

She was accepted to a medical college in the Vakhsh district and wants to work as a nurse, just like her mother, and take care of sick people. She is a smart and well-brought up young woman. She really wants to obtain a medical diploma and will study diligently for it. Unfortunately, Dilrabo has not yet paid for her daughter's tuition due to the lack of finances.

He is an enterprising man who is determined to move ahead in life. He does not let himself be defeated by the obstacles in life, but he strives to fulfill his goals and dreams. He has five children to support. The oldest one already works to help with the financial resources of his family. The other four children are excellent students at the school in their community (Diego is the the first one on the left of the photo). He gets his financial income by producing bananas in the community where he lives. His parents taught him this 30 years ago. He sells his product at the market and in the surroundings of his community in order to have an income to improve his family's quality of life. He will use the loan to maintain his banana plants, because it is very important that his plants produce first quality fruits and that he does not lose his customers. He is a good role model in his community and this is why a group of people joined Diego to also start producing bananas to improve their families' life conditions. One of his greatest wishes is to grow more banana plants and to see his children grow in the education field and become professionals; and to build houses for his children so that they have adequate life conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1700094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to maintain the banana plants.

Poultry farming is a big business with the ever-growing hospitality industry in the region. Hotels and educational institutions create a huge demand for eggs and meat. Obadiah is constrained financially to seize this great opportunity. He is banking on online angels to make this dream a reality.\r\n\r\nThe money he will make from selling eggs will repay the loan.

and lack of capital. This is not true for Samwel, who is based in the Kisii area of Kenya, and is a father of seven lovely children. He has been practicing mixed farming for the past two years. He has managed to earn a decent income. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business he engages in, to make that extra coin. Samwel enjoys the farming lifestyle. He has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that he names each of them. \r\n\r\nHe has aspirations of expanding his dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, he has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Samwel is kindly requesting KES 31,200 to purchase a high yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, he will have more quantity for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, he will be able to service his loan on time.

She is married to Jose, a \"taho\" vendor. She and her husband work hard to provide income to support their aging parents and meet their daily basic needs.\r\n\r\nSabina has been in the food vending business for seven years already. She cooks gallons of taho (cooked soya beans with syrup) and her husband sells them by the cups at a profit. \"Taho\" is a favorite food of Filipinos--the average Filipino household buys it by the cup from a vendor who regularly passes by in front of the houses in the villages. It is freshly cooked and warm and is usually eaten for breakfast. The local residents in their community are her regular customers.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue with her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan, which she will use to buy the raw ingredients like soya beans and sugar to cook her taho. She is positive for a good turnout for her business. Their customers are always looking forward to buying and eating her yummy warm taho.

He is based in Chepkemel, a remote village in the rural town of Kericho. He has a wife and 6 children, and wants to lay a good foundation for his family and grandchildren to come. This is why he started farming and has been practicing mixed farming for the past 30 years. His primary source of income is milk, tea, and some personal businesses.\r\n\r\nWilly is very passionate about dairy farming and always says, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart\u201d. He has nicknamed his dairy cow \u201cChemunge\u201d. Dairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed. This translates to increased earnings for farmers. Willy, being a very hardworking and visionary farmer, wants to take advantage of the ready market; therefore he kindly seeks a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to buy a good quality breed of a dairy cow. Willy has already decided what type of dairy breed he requires and, because of the immense knowledge he has on preparing hay, his cows will never lack animal food which will ensure increased milk production. \r\n\r\nWilly projects that, through the loan, his cow will be giving out more than 10 liters a day. Marketing the milk will never be a challenge because he will be selling it directly to the market as well as to big dairy-processing firms and will result in increased earnings.

Her house, covered with corrugated iron sheet, is at the centre of a compound within her luxuriant five acre farm. She started farming in the year 1999. Today, she makes money from selling milk, offering motorcycle transportation services and a side hustle that involves the selling of shoes and clothes. However, surrounded by fresh air, wide open space, and peaceful, natural sounds, she cherishes every minute spent with her cows.\r\n \r\nJaneth is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to construct a cow barn and buy a motorcycle that will help with the transportation of goods and people. The barn will help improve animal health, hygiene and nutrition. The introduction of zero-grazing will help her to improve dairy management, utilize space in her farm, use pasture more efficiently and ration feed.\r\n \r\nIn rural towns of Kenya, Indian motorcycles are in vogue. Farmers, like Janeth, use the roadster bicycles to transport passengers and farm goods to and from the market. They are suited for areas with poor road networks which are inaccessible by cars. They are also very cheap to acquire and maintain. \r\n\r\nInvest in Janeth's future and you won't regret it. She is full of promise. So far, she has managed to send her children to standard private schools with her blood, sweat, and tears.

off of the land, and 80 percent of the food that people eat comes from people who sell in the rural marketplace,\u201d says Margaret, a 57-year-old mixed farmer based in Ibencho, a remote village in the Kisii area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of five school-going children whom she truly loves and greatly adores. Margaret always describes her upbringing as challenging, and that is why she is doing everything in her power to provide a good foundation for her children and to be able to secure their future. Margaret has been farming for over 15 years. Over the years, she has gained much experience and is now considered one of the best farmers in her village because of the immense knowledge that she possesses. Margaret passionately loves dairy farming and she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cOnyango\u201d (a person\u2019s name).\r\n\r\nSince she has excess dairy food and enough space on her land, Margaret has always wanted to buy another dairy cow, but the challenge that she has been facing is lack of finances. That is why Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Margret to turn their dreams into reality. Margaret believes that the loan will help her to satisfy the milk demand in her area and, through the accumulated profits, she will be able to realize her dream of developing her business into a large enterprise. \r\n\r\nMany women in Kenya are responsible for not only producing food, but also feeding their family. Margaret, being a hardworking farmer, wants to provide all of the basic needs that her children and parents require.

Meet Edina, an ever-smiling young farmer from Kisii County in Kenya. She has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is a proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business, in order to make ends meet.<br \/><br \/>Edina passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Edina is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand.

They have a son and two daughters. Their son, Abubakr, is a university student, and their daughters Sofiya and Sudoba are in school.\r\n\r\nAbubakr is a first-year student in the regional medical college majoring in pharmacy. His annual tuition is $820 USD. Unfortunately, Oyniso and her husband don't have enough resources to pay this sum this year. Therefore, Oyniso decided to look for a loan of $1,000 USD. $820 of this will be used to pay her son's tuition, and the remainder will be used for school supplies. She hopes that her difficult situation will be understood and that she will receive this financial support that she needs.

She started pursuing her passion in the year 2008. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Mwembe, a remote village in the Kisii area of Kenya. She is a proud mother of seven lovely children. For the past six years she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. \r\n\r\nMary passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan which she used to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. \r\n\r\nMary is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day.

15 years in Litein, Kenya. He sells produce from the farm, which includes milk and other crops, at the local market. He also engages in other personal businesses to make enough money to provide for his family of three children.\r\n \r\nSamwel spends a lot of time tending to his animals and land. Spraying is the activity he finds to be the most enjoyable. Samwel complains that working on the land is becoming more strenuous with age. The one factor contributing to the strain is the type of tools he employs.\r\n\r\nSamwel is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase farm equipment. Small-holder farmers usually prefer indigenous tools because they are economical, feasible and sustainable. Despite being common, they are generally not preferred to modern tools since they are inefficient and tiring to use.

It consists of four women who live in Sana'a, Yemen. They applied for a loan of 180,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nNoria is the leader of the group. She is a 56-year-old married woman and a mother of six children, living with her family in a rented house in a poor area in Sana'a city. Her husband is an employee with a very small salary which isn't enough to cover the necessary needs of the family. Noria and her family live and sleep in very old furniture. Most of that furniture  is not suitable for life because of its bad appearance.

She has been farming for 13 years. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from the Kiva, she would like to buy more fertilizers for maize. The profits from the farming will be used to improve her welfare.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

They learn how to manage their loans in an effective way with classes on effective business management practices, such as budgeting, planning, marketing and customer service. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria and her friends in the Trust Bank are really happy to provide additional income for their families.

Her mother tongue is Spanish. Her need to expand her business and generate better income has led her to request a loan. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling cosmetics on the streets. Every day, loaded down with a large bag full of products, she travels between all the street fairs and markets in search of customers. She finds them in their businesses, offices, stores, etc. Her work day begins very early in the morning and ends very late at night, because, as she says, \"selling has no schedule.\" \r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a shop where she can exhibit and sell her cosmetics; at that time, she will quit walking, as her big bag weighs quite a bit. She would like to make her merchandise purchases at wholesale, so that she can increase her working capital and have a more varied inventory. For these reasons, Adela is requesting a loan for the purchase of cosmetics at wholesale, and to one day have a shop to work

She and her husband work hard to meet their daily household needs and for the schooling of their children.  \n\nNenita owns a tricycle unit and she also has a food business. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Coron, a tricycle is the more common means of transportation.  Buses and jeepneys are limited.  Her husband drives her tricycle unit and earns around PHP 500 a day. She also operates a small canteen in their area. \n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan which she will use for repairs and maintenance of her tricycle and also to add some grocery items for her small variety store. She is positive that this will boost her income as tricycle transportation and a variety store is really a need in their place.\n\n\nNenita dreams of building and expanding her business to secure the education of her children for them to have a bright future.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband has been running a general store for many years near his house, and the business is operating very well.\n\nEarlier he was selling bakery items in large quantities, but to meet customer demand, he wants to offer rice, sugar, flour etc. He does not want to refuse to stock any product and disappoint any of his respected customers. He wants to offer all those products which are necessary and consumable in a daily routine. In this way, he will successfully win the trust of his customers and increase his income as well.\n\nTherefore, Zubaida requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband could buy sacks of rice, sugar and flour for his general store. She is very glad after having taken this loan and hopeful that her husband will be able to successfully fulfill each request for any item and prevent the disappointment of his customers. Zubaida is very thankful to Kiva and to BRAC Pakistan.

Every day I go to school on foot because the school is close to home (approximately 100m) . I\u2019am the third child, and my parents work as ordinary farm laborers. The results of my parents are very minimal. Crop yields are dependent on the weather. In the rainy season, sometimes there is crop failure. Meanwhile, my brother needs money to attend school. I myself want to go to school because I want to develop in the future. I'd love to make my parents happy, as long as they work hard for my sister and I, so we can all go to school. Every school day I help my mom do the housework after I study. I joined the program of Kiva because my parents are unable to pay for school in a timely manner. I am very grateful to those who have provided loans for my school fees.

In the Philippines, a food stall is a common sight, especially in populated areas. Working class people usually buy their meals at food stalls at reasonable prices for convenience and to save money instead of cooking at home.

She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 daily.\r\n\r\nTo help her maintain her business, Lydia is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan to buy packs of charcoal, oil and soft drinks needed for her business. She believes that her sales and earnings will increase with this financial assistance.

He is a very hardworking young man who is dedicated to all his daily activities. He went to school until fourth grade, because the place where he lives is quite isolated and there aren't educational opportunities, and also because of his family's financial situation.\r\n\r\nHumberto is single. He lives with his parents in their house along with four younger brothers. With his father and two other brothers, he works for the daily sustenance of the family.\r\n\r\nThe main activity that Humberto carries out with his father is growing vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes, green beans, etc. He has already been working for approximately four years in this business, which is so important to them. That's where they get their income, through their sales. \r\n\r\nThey have their crops close to their house, so they are always tending to them. In addition to growing vegetables, he also works as a day laborer, as it's another activity that generates income for the family. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to buy fertilizers and to prepare the soil to plant cucumbers; he already has the seed. Thanks to the loan, he will have other crops that will generate greater income for his family.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Humberto would like to be able to have a greenhouse system for his crops, because he says that nowadays it is quite difficult to have crops in the winter because there are many infestations that affect the crops. He would also like to build his own house, and have his own family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1700728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy fertilizers and prepare the soil to cultivate cucumbers; he already has the seed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T02:10:33Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T02:10:33Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":29.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":31.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.55,"local_amount":28.55,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":28.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420740},{"amount":27.62,"local_amount":27.62,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":27.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545442},{"amount":29.08,"local_amount":29.08,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":29.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145838},{"amount":32.79,"local_amount":32.79,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":32.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769387},{"amount":281.96,"local_amount":281.96,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":281.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833028}],"funded_date":"2014-10-11T16:54:35Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:05:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Torpey","image":1097817}},{"id":776718,"name":"Nikki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"She is Nikki, 28, a resident of Tondo, Manila, Philippines.

Piso Net is basically a merge of PC rental and Arcade rental services wherein customers can use the services by inserting coins to the machine. There is a big need for services like these in the Philippines since only a few own a Personal Computer.  Her main patrons are students who do their school requirements.  It serves business purposes like writing resumes, office documentation, and legal documents. It also serves the youths' and adults' hobby of surfing the net and any social networks. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 a day. It greatly helps to meet her family's daily basic personal and household needs and for the schooling of her kids.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan and will use the loan to buy additional Piso Net units. She is positive that it will help improve her earnings as she adds another PC unit to her shop. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial assistance that will be given her.\r\n\r\nNikki dreams to give her children a bright future and send them to the best schools.
