previous loan to pay for maintenance and  spare parts needed in her computer shop business. Her earnings were a big help in their personal, house hold, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nRizel now focuses on a new business venture, which is selling fruit. She would like to apply for another 25,000 PHP loan  to purchase fruit needed in her business. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to meet her daily needs and educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nRizel hopes for her business to become more established and will continue to help support with their everyday needs.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nHelen hopes for her business to continue to flourish, and she only wants a simple life for her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Meet Purity, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Chuka area of Kenya, near the famous Mount Kenya. Purity,43 , has been farming for the past 20 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nPurity is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Chuka area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Purity could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Purity, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Purity believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Purity to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1703823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2924.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3044.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3101.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3194.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3362.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3389.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3508.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3713.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3812.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3926.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.45,"local_amount":3062.31,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3073.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680905},{"amount":32.15,"local_amount":2857.83,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2867.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625187},{"amount":35.81,"local_amount":3183.15,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3194.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194337},{"amount":72.14,"local_amount":6412.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6434.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823647},{"amount":38.71,"local_amount":3441.29,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3453.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264273},{"amount":39.76,"local_amount":3533.87,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600468},{"amount":196.98,"local_amount":17509.43,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17570.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458972}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T08:56:26Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":776806,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is 46 years old, married, and together with her spouse they have been blessed with four children.

They make their daily living as farmers and pig farmers in the village of Baturiti, North Bali.\r\n\r\nNi Nyoman is trying to develop her pig business and previously took a loan from the MUK. From the sale of 3 pigs, Ni Nyoman managed to get a profit of 600,000 IDR. The gain was very helpful to the family's finances as they are currently experiencing difficult times due to increasingly expensive necessities of life. One member decided to resign after she successfully sold her pigs and earned a satisfactory profit. \r\n\r\nNi Nyoman, with Bawi Lestari 2 group, decided to continue borrowing from the MUK as it is especially helpful in developing pig businesses. Because the price of pigs and pig feed seedlings is increasing, Ni Nyoman expects an increase in borrowing in the next period of time.\r\n\r\nThis is Bawi Lestari 2 group's fifth loan. It is a loan amount of 24,500,000 IDR. The loan in this current period will be used to buy piglets, sows and also to support any other businesses owned by members such as a small kiosk.\r\n\r\nNi Nyoman, head of the group, will be using her portion of the loan to buy two piglets and the rest will be used to fix their cage. She plans to keep a sow and become a piglet seller. Currently the price is quite expensive for piglets, 600,000 IDR per piglet. \r\n\r\nNi Nyoman has a dream that this business will become a major source of family income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":1703655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy two piglets and the rest to fix the cage","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Baturiti_Tabanan_Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":24500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2025,"local_amount":24500000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":24542996.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636272948}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T19:59:25Z","paid_date":"2015-04-19T11:19:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":776809,"name":"Epefania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epefania has been growing rice to provide for her family.

She is a responsible housewife and looks after her family at home. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. He has been running an auto rickshaw for the last four years. For the past many days, his rickshaw has not been working properly because of his regular use of it. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So, he is unable to generate any amount of income, and he wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of new rickshaw. Therefore Zahida has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business. Zahida is so thankful to Kiva and BRAC

She is a single mother and has been practising mixed farming for the past one year.\r\n\r\nOn her farm, she grows maize and keeps dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs and maize; and when she is not farming, Judith offers transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her parents, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meagre earnings, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Judith formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers. \r\n\r\nShe acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful), which produces milk daily, which Judith sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Judith.\r\n\r\nThe money Judith got from selling the milk was adequate to repay a loan. Today, Judith is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Judith is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health and a good livelihood."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1703852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3733.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3842.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3954.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4070.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4189.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4311.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4437.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4567.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4700.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4838.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4979.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5125.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.85,"local_amount":8866.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9005.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625188},{"amount":499.15,"local_amount":43883.76,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":44575.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194339}],"funded_date":"2014-10-04T18:52:39Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":776842,"name":"Absalom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Absalom is 41 years old and married.

and lack of capital. This is not true for Jane, 46, who is based in the Eldoret area of Kenya and is a mother of four lovely children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past 20 years. \r\n\r\nShe has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking Chemiambut (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. \r\n\r\nThe dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nJane is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also to start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1703864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.67,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3733.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3842.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3954.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4070.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4189.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4311.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4437.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4567.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4700.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4838.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4979.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5125.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.85,"local_amount":8866.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9005.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625189},{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":4103,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4167.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194340},{"amount":97.18,"local_amount":8543.44,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8678.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262174},{"amount":102.64,"local_amount":9023.44,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9165.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600469},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":4079.96,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4144.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.54,"payment_id":681377327},{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":4799.38,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4874.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.17,"payment_id":696587086},{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":4139.83,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4205.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.19,"payment_id":711505345},{"amount":53.58,"local_amount":4950.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5028.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.73,"payment_id":731022205},{"amount":46.22,"local_amount":4244.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4310.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.04,"payment_id":752110498}],"funded_date":"2014-10-04T21:51:46Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zoe Benston","image":null}},{"id":776850,"name":"Ma.

Meet Magdalene, 44 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kapseret, a remote village in Eldoret. She is happily married and is blessed with two adorable children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last eight years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in other small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Eldoret area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets, and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1703876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T17:40:06Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.18,"local_amount":5158.06,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5373.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625190},{"amount":28.26,"local_amount":2422.4,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2523.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194341},{"amount":57.51,"local_amount":4929.74,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5136.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262175},{"amount":60.26,"local_amount":5164.91,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5381.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600470},{"amount":61.09,"local_amount":5416.41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5643.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.1,"payment_id":681377328},{"amount":75.14,"local_amount":6908.48,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7197.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.46,"payment_id":711505346}],"funded_date":"2014-10-06T07:41:14Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":775063,"name":"Luz Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Luz Marina se dedica al negocio de tienda de abarrotes, la socia vende productos de primera necesidad como arroz, azucar, leche y galletas, la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 10:00 p.m, la socia ya tiene 8 a\u00f1os en este negocio y le va muy bien, el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el negocio de tienda de abarrotes.

Meet Patrick, a youthful, 59-year-old \"guka\" (old man), who is a father to three good-looking children. He is based in Rudati, a remote village in the Chuka area of Kenya. This is an area with high poultry production and consumption. For 15 years Patrick has been actively involved in mixed farming, as a source of income. He has a beautiful and supportive wife, who helps him with farm work and domestic chores. His primary sources of income are milk, crops, and some personal business that he does to make ends meet.<br \/><br \/>He passionately loves poultry farming, and this can be noticed in how he takes good care of his poultry birds and feeds them. When he was asked what he enjoys about poultry farming, he replied that he enjoys \u201cpicking up the eggs every day in the morning.\u201d However, this humble and honest man faces challenges of not meeting the demand for eggs, and not satisfying his ever-increasing client base. That is why he is requesting a loan -- to buy good quality breeds of poultry birds. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture, and the demand for chicken is always high, because it is such a popular meal for so many people. In addition to earning increased profits, Patrick will benefit from poultry manure, which will save him some money that he otherwise would have used to buy fertilizer. With the increased income from selling eggs, poultry meat, and feathers, he will permanently change his living conditions and secure the future of his school-going

Meet Burunja who is 46 and is a very dedicated father who believes in hard work. He is happily married and blessed with two lovely children whom he often refers to as \u201cmy pride.\u201d He is based in Chuka, a small remote rural town in Kenya that has bad terrain and is characterized by drought and bad weather conditions. For the past 15 years, Burunja has been actively involved in mixed farming. His primary source of income is from milk and crop farming. Burunja passionately loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of his cows \u201cWanja.\u201d  Milking Wanja is his hobby and feeding his cows makes him very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Burunja. Although this humble man makes a living through selling milk, he faces the challenge of irrigating his farm and providing water to his animals. Chuka is a remote area without piped water or electricity. Since Burunja is from a marginalized community, he is forced to walk long distances to search for water. He typically walks for two hours. Therefore, Burunja is requesting a loan to buy a water tank. Most of the rain water in his area goes to waste and Burunja wants to harvest the water and store it in a water tank. The loan will save Burunja time and allow him to irrigate his farm during dry seasons and increase his productivity. The increase in productivity will translate into more income, which will provide Burunja with financial security. Burunja will also use the stored water for home consumption. Burunja\u2019s dream is to increase his farming activities and provide his children with a proper education. Education is the only way that his children, who are from a marginalized community, can succeed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1703910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burunja","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":9.82,"local_amount":785.68,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":877.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680907},{"amount":9.58,"local_amount":766.62,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":855.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625193},{"amount":9.62,"local_amount":769.57,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":859.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194344},{"amount":10.07,"local_amount":805.53,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":899.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823650},{"amount":10.24,"local_amount":819.23,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":914.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262178},{"amount":10.22,"local_amount":817.2,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":912.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264276},{"amount":10.4,"local_amount":831.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":928.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600473},{"amount":11,"local_amount":879.86,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":982.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458974},{"amount":10.97,"local_amount":907.29,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1012.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.37,"payment_id":681377331},{"amount":30.49,"local_amount":2617.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2921.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.22,"payment_id":711505349}],"funded_date":"2014-10-04T20:40:55Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":776891,"name":"Ligaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ligaya is 50 years old.

Born in 1977 in the Nandi region of Kenya, Ruth has grown up to be a very hardworking and enterprising woman. Her upbringing was not easy but at least she managed to finish her primary education. \r\n\r\nShe is currently running a 5.5 acre mixed farm in Sugoi village with the unwavering contribution of her dear 40-year-old husband. She keeps poultry, sheep and dairy cattle that give her eggs, meat and milk to sell. \r\n\r\nRuth is seeking a loan to purchase land. Since 1996, when she ventured into farming, she has been relying on her husband's farm to run the agribusiness, and still will. However, the business has grown and all the space is totally utilized. With the loan investment, she will acquire additional land to facilitate the growth of her business.\r\n\r\nHer financial discipline led her to be appointed the treasurer of Emkwen Group (made up of farmers who save together and use the savings to access and guarantee loans of each member). Returns from the investment will go toward loan repayment, setting up the new land and food for her family. She will also use the money to meet all the basic needs of her family.

The 49-year-old mother of four is a smallholder farmer based in Tapsagoi village, found in the North Rift region of Kenya. The secondary-educated entrepreneur runs a mixed-farm in where she keeps three fairly-productive dairy cows that produce milk for both consumption and sale.\r\n \r\nRose started farming in 1990. She farms on a 4 acre piece of land that belongs to her husband, whose professional activities have very little to do with agriculture. She was doing it for subsistence but recently switched it up for commercial produce. The income she made from this transition greatly improved her income status to enable her to afford her children a better education at standard private schools. Rose has one employee to help her run the farm business when she is attending her day job or doing her side job which involves selling cosmetic products for extra income.\r\n\r\nRose is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter and animal feed. She places more premiums on animal health and nutrition in her dairy business than other factors. Animal feed has a lot to do with the proper composition of the animal products that she sells to her customers. She is seeking this loan to ensure that her animals have the proper feed composition that the animals require. The chaff cutter is handy during feed preparation to ensure that hay is evenly cut into appropriately small pieces that cows will enjoy to ingest and easily digest. \r\n\r\nReturns from this investment will enable Rose to pay for her children's education expenses. She wants nothing but the best foundation for her children's future.

She was blessed with three children. \r\n\r\nElvisa is the breadwinner for the family. She has experienced hardships, especially in raising her family. This industrious family member finds herself plowing the rice field, planting vegetables and other varieties of agricultural goods. In need of additional working capital, Elvisa decided to join Paglaum Cooperative. She has received several loans already and recently requested 25,000 PHP to buy farm and garden fertilizer and to pay labor costs for cultivating the land.\r\n\r\nBeing a MIGS member (Member in Good Standing) of the cooperative, she has been able to manage her income. She is able to provide for the daily needs of her family. Elvisa is very thankful because, if it were not for Paglaum, she might not have any savings at all, nor be guided properly in her finances.

Caroline is a mother of five, and she has been in an agricultural business for 14 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and vegetables. Caroline has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Caroline remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nCaroline is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of her business least affected by harsh external conditions. A poultry farm is cheaper to run, and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Caroline will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profit. An increase in income for her is timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of her work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better quality produce and more yields.

She is a smallholder farmer based in Kamagut village, which is found in the North Rift region of Kenya. The 24-year-old farmer started in 2012 with a dairy cow and poultry for milk and eggs. As of today, she has also ventured into crop farming both for sale and consumption. She sells her produce at Eldoret which is one of the fastest growing towns in Africa. \r\n\r\nEmily is seeking a loan to venture into banana farming. Growing bananas does not require much effort, but to achieve high yields requires skills, dedication, and proper planting methods. Emily, who has one child, feels she is cut out for it. She has adequate space at the 2 acre farm she owns for this project. She also has 2 employees who are farmers, and they will come in handy to get the banana farm off the ground. \r\n\r\nReturns from this investment will enable Emily to pay for food, which is her highest monthly expense when she is not servicing a loan. She managed to attain a secondary education herself. With your investment, she will make enough income to educate her child and even further her own education if the stars align.

His primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. Paul passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cTatii\u201d (this is from a person\u2019s name), and whenever he is milking his cow, he feels proud.

He is requesting a loan to buy a generator that he will use in pumping water from the river to his farm. Irrigation is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and re-vegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Through this loan, he will be able to double his crop production, and this will translate to more income. Through the extra income from farming, he will be able to support his family and keep up with his rising family expenses.

Meet Christine, a very hardworking and honest mother who decided that she would be independent and contribute to her community by starting dairy farming in Chuka, Kenya. Deciding what kind of farming she would do was not difficult. \u201cI was brought up with dairy cows raised by my grandfather and grandmother,\u201d Christine said. \u201cIt is in my blood.\u201d She passionately loves dairy farming and has been practicing it for the past 15 years. She has never regretted starting to farm. \r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income are milk, eggs, and crop farming. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her take care of her family and she has always yearned to produce more dairy milk. The major challenge she faces is feeding her cows. She is requesting a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device for cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage to feed the cattle. Through the loan her cows will be aided in digestion and they will never reject any part of the food. Christine strongly believes that through proper feeding of the cows she will reap more and it will lead to increased milk production which will translate into more sales and a better income. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Christine\u2019s life is going to change permanently. Because of this high milk production potential, she will save more money to fully repay the loan. She believes that through careful selection and the application of the strict standard of excellence in keeping her dairy cows, she will have more income, which will improve her living

It is a profession that is worthy of admiring the men that dedicate themselves to it for years or for their whole lifetime. The earth without the labor of these farmers working to cultivate it would not produce the fruits that sustain whole generations.  <br \/><br \/>This is the work that Pedro does. He is 69 years old, single and has 5 children. The oldest two are independent and the younger three are excellent students in the school in the community. The work that Pedro does every day under a relentless sun is agriculture. He has been doing this for 30 years. This activity has generated economic income to improve his family's living conditions.<br \/><br \/>The harvest he expects to reap his year is corn, beans and broccoli which he will later sell in the market of his community. He will use the loan to buy organic and chemical fertilizers to get able to produce a good harvest, and get more economic revenues to further improve the quality of living of his family and community. One of his biggest hopes is to see his children become professionals in different work fields and buy land to leave a memory for his children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1700942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic and chemical fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-10-04T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-03T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":197.49,"local_amount":1519.18,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1524.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134603},{"amount":44.2,"local_amount":340.02,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":341.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664972377},{"amount":26,"local_amount":200.03,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":200.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477920},{"amount":36.97,"local_amount":284.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":285.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711385679},{"amount":20.34,"local_amount":156.42,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":156.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731215810}],"funded_date":"2014-10-05T00:10:44Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:18:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":776970,"name":"Naziran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naziran is a 45-year-old working woman.

runners who have broken major world records. She is blessed with five children, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past fifteen years. \r\n\r\nOn her farm, she grows maize and keeps a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize, and when she is not farming, Dinah offers transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meager earnings. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is drought. The long, dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Dinah formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small, rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for \u201cbeautiful\u201d), which produces milk daily, and which Dinah sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Dinah. The money Dinah got from selling the milk was adequate to repay a loan. \r\n\r\nToday, Dinah is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Dinah is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer.

Today, this humble mother of two children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes a profit through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit so she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have an easier time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Zeddy believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Together, they have a family with two children.  Eduardo and his father worked buying and selling cars.  One of their customers recommended that they sell clothing and they decided to try it.  Since the beginning, they have had good profits and have continued to invest little by little until they had four years of experience.  Eduardo goes out to sell in the plazas and street markets, and also takes advantage of the times when people gather at certain points in town thanks to government programs.  Eduardo likes this work very much because he earns good profits in a short time period.  He can recoup his investment in three days and his money is always moving.\r\n\r\nEduardo is very happy and grateful to Kiva and VisionFund because he will be able to buy more merchandise with his loan, including pants, jackets, sweatshirts, t-shirts, and tops.  \"I hope to continue like this to be able to expand my business and open other branches in other places.\"\r\n\r\nThe group members are Evodio, who will invest in sheep, Janet, who will buy groceries, and Griselda, who will buy clothing.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph, Eduardo is carrying his baby.

Meet Casty, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Chuka area of Kenya, near the famous Mount Kenya. \r\n\r\nCasty, 39, has been farming for the past 15 years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been bananas, milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nCasty is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Chuka area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Casty could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Casty, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Casty believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals.

Esperanza\u201d, meaning \u201cNew Hope,\u201d that is located in San Crist\u00f3bal, Totonicap\u00e1n, in the western highlands of Guatemala. Two of the women are new to the group and are quite excited about opportunities for growth, not only for themselves but for their families as well. \r\n\r\nSanta is 38 years old with three children and is quite pleased that two of them are in elementary school. She  is a member of the Trust Bank. Santa works along with her husband in a family business. The couple creates and decorates beautiful traditional skirts called \u201ccortes.\u201d  The \u201ccortes,\u201d that vary from three to six yards of fabric, are usually woven on a treadle loom by men.  Each village has its own unique design and hemline length. The women step into the tubular shape of the \u201ccorte,\u201d tuck their ornately decorated blouse or \u201chuipil\u201d into it, and complete the outfit with a handmade embroidered belt called a \u201cfaja.\u201d\r\n\r\nSanta is quite creative and sees the necessity of updating her designs and improving the quality of the fabric that she weaves. She is requesting a new loan that she will use to purchase thread, dye, parts for the loom, and supplies for her textile business. Her goal is to increase sales, generate additional income, and improve the living standard of her family. Her family is committed to helping her meet the demand of her clients. Her children and husband are quite involved in the business. Santa also employs  a young man who helps her deliver the finished \u201ccortes.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe ladies of the \u201cNueva Esperanza\u201d Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings with a Loan Officer from Friendship Bridge. They not only make payments on their loans but also participate in educational seminars that cover a wide variety of timely subjects. Some of these topics include effective business management practices, health, hygiene, and the use of medicinal plants as well as self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. Recently, the women learned about childhood and teenage pregnancy. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d It is a most effective combination.\r\n\r\nKIVA investors bring hope to the women of the Trust Bank and are much appreciated. The ladies can step into a brighter future as empowered women eliminating poverty. We look forward to providing an update to you on the members of the \u201cNueva Esperanza\u201d Trust Bank."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5725,"image":{"id":1703513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

The majority of the population works in traditional textile production and animal husbandry. Others work fabricating modern clothing such as tee shirts and pants. The ten women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres de Pasaccap\u201d work in these businesses in order to generate income for their families  and raise their standard of living.\r\n\r\nRaimunda is 29 years old and is a member of the Trust Bank. She is separated from her husband and is raising her son as a single mother. She is committed to having a comfortable home for her son and to achieve that goal, she needed to generate income.  Raimunda has a small textile business and sews pants. She is able to make just enough income to cover the household expenses and those of her son. But Raimunda needs more capital to inject into the business and increase sales. She now sells her pants by the dozen each week. Raimunda wants to purchase an additional sewing machine and perhaps hire an employee. Her dream is to teach her son how to sew so that the two of them can become business partners and, working together,  generate more income for the family.\r\n\r\nMost of the women in the Friendship Bridge Trust Banks have had little or no formal education. Therefore, the ladies are eager to learn about relevant and timely subjects so that they can more effectively manage their loans and elevate the living standard in their families. Each month, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer coordinates participatory educational seminars for the women. Topics can range from self esteem, health and hygiene to violence against women, childhood pregnancy. They learn how to manage their loans with information about accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing and other effective business practices. \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d is the name that Friendship Bridge calls the partnership of loans and education.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres de Pasaccap\u201d share that they are most appreciative of the kindness and generosity of KIVA investors. Armed with their new tools, they are poised to step into a brighter and more successful future, benefitting themselves, their families and their community.

She works alone, and every day she has to push her cart until she finds shade where she can make herself comfortable. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a fixed location so she does not have to load up her cart every day. She also wants to buy wholesale ingredients to make empanadas, such as flour, raisins, olives, potatoes, onions, etc. Her home also needs repairs, such as fixing the roof, changing out old pipes, etc. Therefore, Micaela has applied for a loan to buy wholesale cooking supplies and to renovate her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1701024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale cooking supplies and renovate her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-10-05T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-04T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":246.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":286.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":304.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":303.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":334.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":352.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":356},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":371.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":390.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":406.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":422.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":425.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.61,"local_amount":246.03,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":252.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561646060},{"amount":42.65,"local_amount":286.59,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":294.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556550},{"amount":45.29,"local_amount":304.37,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":312.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157235},{"amount":46.15,"local_amount":310.11,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":318.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554134},{"amount":48.72,"local_amount":327.41,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":336.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226676},{"amount":405.58,"local_amount":2725.49,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2802.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213859}],"funded_date":"2014-10-20T14:18:48Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":775127,"name":"Francis Yanett","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  se\u00f1ora  Zoila   de  48  a\u00f1os  de edad  es casada y vive con su esposo en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n y cuenta con un puesto en el mercado local del municipio,  vende  ropa interior para dama y caballeros, ropa de ni\u00f1o, juguetes, desodorantes y cremas, etc.\nDo\u00f1a Zoila  es una persona muy luchadora  y est\u00e1 muy contenta con el apoyo que se le est\u00e1 brindando, vive en el municipio de San Lorenzo al sur de Honduras. \nDo\u00f1a Zoila  est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de bl\u00fameres, braseares, vestidos, blusas, camisas, pantalones, tambi\u00e9n para compra de  juguetes para el d\u00eda del ni\u00f1o, espera que esta inversi\u00f3n le sea de mucha ayuda y mejore sus ingresos. \nSu sue\u00f1o es  surtir m\u00e1s su negocio y obtener mejores ganancias.\n\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras  -

Marlene is dark skinned, of medium height, long loose hair. Her native language is guarani, which she almost forgot because Spanish is used to do business in the area. Her business is selling typical local food of the place such as locro (stew), spicy chicken, patasca (soup), duck and chicken majadito, anticucho (kebab), among others.

is a 47-year-old woman. She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible housewife and looks after her family at home. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. He has been running an auto rickshaw business for the last seven years. For the past many days, his rickshaw has not been working properly. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. Therefore, Sughran has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.
