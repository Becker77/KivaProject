He is married and has 5 children, 4 of them are currently in school. For the past 15 years, Paul has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells essential goods like sugar, salt and water. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Paul has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

A pesar de su edad, sabe que debe trabajar con todo su empe\u00f1o pues a\u00fan apoya a tres de sus hijos que viven con ella y con los estudios de dos de ellos que est\u00e1n a punto de terminar una carrera profesional. \n\nDo\u00f1a F\u00e9lix platica que desde que decidi\u00f3 formar una familia inici\u00f3 a trabajar como empleada dom\u00e9stica para ayudar con los gastos de su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Con los pocos ahorros de su empleo, comenz\u00f3 a cultivar habas, tomates, nopales, frijoles, calabazas, etc para venderlos de casa en casa, actividad que a\u00fan conserva. sin embargo, explica que en muchas ocasiones, sus clientes no ten\u00edan dinero y comenz\u00f3 a recibir despensa o ropa para sus hijos como forma de pago. Fue as\u00ed como inici\u00f3 su tienda de abarrotes y sigui\u00f3 invirtiendo para tener m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda.

Despite her age, she knows that she must continue putting all her dedication into her work because she still has to support the three children who live with her and help cover school expenses for the two who are close to completing professional training courses.\r\n\r\nF\u00e9lix explained that since she decided to form a family, she began working as a maid to help with household expenses and her children\u2019s education. With the small savings from her work, she began to grow broad beans, tomatoes, prickly pear, beans, pumpkin, etc. to sell door to door. She continues this activity, but further explains that in many cases her clients didn\u2019t have money to pay her, and she began receiving foodstuffs or clothes for her children as a form of payment. This is how her general store began, and she continues to invest in new merchandise. Her earnings have allowed F\u00e9lix to build her house and help her children with their schooling. \r\n\r\nBecause the rainy season is approaching, F\u00e9lix will, like every year, sell cleaning products and plastic goods like oilcloth that people use to protect various parts of their homes from the rain.

She is married and has five children, with four of them currently in school. For the past five years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her mini-supermarket, which sells essential goods such as sugar, salt, and water. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more items, such as sugar, rice, and all types of flour, for sale. This will help Sarah to generate greater profits, improve on her social life, and educate her children in better schools. Sarah hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand the business into a bigger supermarket. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Sarah who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1704954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is 32 years old and lives in the town of Kisasi in the Kampala east region of Uganda. She is married and has 3 children who are all currently in school. For the past 6 years, she has been working hard to manage her beauty salon, which does hair dressing. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Getrude has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more hair dryers for the business, and will help Getrude to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. She hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business to include a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nGetrude is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Getrude who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

","en":"Vera works in the central market of Belaya Tserkov.  She sells women's shoes, and has done so for the past 21 years.  She has a lot of experience under her belt and has owned her own market stall for a long time as well.

has made him well known in the industry and helped him achieve the success that he has.\r\n\r\nHe is therefore requesting a loan to build up his stock. He will buy products such as leather, soles, and glues to use in his business so he can satisfy demand, which goes up during the school year because his business is strategically located in an area where there are a lot of students. This will help him increase the income he earns from his labor.\r\n\r\nFernando says that though he is relatively inexperienced, he has been able to keep doing what he loves. He always sets himself new goals to pursue; his current goal is to become a major shoe distributor and generate employment opportunities so he can improve the quality of life and well-being of not just his family but also the people who help him carry out his work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1701750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy products such as leather, soles, and glues to use in his business so he can satisfy demand, which goes up during the school year.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sahagun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-10-06T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-05T00:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":44.7,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernando Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61603},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63333},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65112},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66940},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68820},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70752},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72739},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74781},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76881},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79039}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.16,"local_amount":60329,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":60913.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561675875},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":63169,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63781.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.41,"payment_id":579599440},{"amount":30.48,"local_amount":66550,"processed_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67195.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.81,"payment_id":595189693},{"amount":29.6,"local_amount":64782,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":65409.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.79,"payment_id":611814934},{"amount":15.15,"local_amount":36407,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":36759.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.05,"payment_id":624864647},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":103395,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104397.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.65,"payment_id":649596184},{"amount":42.29,"local_amount":96016,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":96946.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.72,"payment_id":665455415},{"amount":31.55,"local_amount":76258,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":76997.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.58,"payment_id":681373442},{"amount":48.85,"local_amount":133094,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":134384.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.69,"payment_id":711501099}],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T17:33:31Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:37:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":777596,"name":"Dulce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dulce is a married woman with seven children.

","en":"Irina is 30 and already divorced. She lives with her two children, aged eight and three, in the southern region of Shahrituz. Her oldest child is in school and the youngest in preschool, and Irina has her own small retail business buying and selling almonds, something she's been doing for five years. She purchases the almonds wholesale from a farmer and then sells them with mark-up to customers at the market. This business is the primary source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to continue her business, Irina needs a loan, since she doesn't have enough money to buy a shipment of almonds. With this goal in mind she is requesting a loan and very hopeful for your support.

Eldoret is home to world-famous Kenyan marathon runners. It is also home to many dairy farming and maize farming families. \r\n\r\nFor the last four years, Cyrus has sustained his family of three children through farming. He sells milk and eggs from the dairy cattle and poultry he keeps at his farm. To boost his income, he also keeps a day job. \r\n\r\nCyrus is seeking a loan to expand his poultry farming. He will use the money to acquire more birds of poultry. He will go for layers in order to boost egg production. This is suitable to Cyrus since he lives close to the market for eggs. Also, his farm has limited space for free-ranging. Eggs sold from this investment will greatly boost the owner's income. \r\n\r\nCyrus stated that his family will enjoy an improvement in financial security with the growth of their asset base after he successfully services the loan.

","en":"Burulkan is 37 years old, a widow, and the mother of three children. She has a secondary education.  For the past ten years already, she has been working in agriculture, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started with an initial capital of 10,000 som (KGS) and she now owns four cows.  Thanks to her very hard work, she makes a monthly income of about 10,000 som (KGS).  However, this amount of money is vastly insufficient to support her family, as Burulkan raises her children alone and sends them to school.  In order to further develop her small business, Burulkan has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy three cows.  The earnings from this loan will allow her to improve her material situation and the living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1703184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

The predominant type of dairy farming, traditional subsistence farming, is done mainly in small scale for survival. Thomas has kept dairy animals for the last three years on his farm in the Eldoret area of Kenya. Since Thomas had children, his personal and financial obligations have skyrocketed. He has different ways to make money, but kept coming up short. \r\n\r\nHe decided the best way to grow economically was to improve his farm's productivity. To increase milk production, he could either buy more cows or replace the existing cows with more productive breeds. The later made more economic sense. Traditional breeds are well-adjusted to the environmental conditions and disease resistance, but their milk production is very low. Cross-breeds and Friesians are more productive, and can survive in the same environment as the traditional breeds, but they come at a price. \r\n\r\nThomas is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase a productive dairy cow that will bring him more income. \r\n\r\nHe will use the additional income to pay for his children's education, and meet family expenses. His future plan is to keep growing his income-generating asset base.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1705298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-06T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-05T12:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.4,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2334.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2402.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2473.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2545.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2619.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2856.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2939.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3025.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3113.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.63,"local_amount":5182.2,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5417.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625216},{"amount":27.7,"local_amount":2367.13,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2474.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194366},{"amount":55.97,"local_amount":4783.78,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5001.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262198},{"amount":57.73,"local_amount":4933.77,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5157.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600490},{"amount":20.6,"local_amount":1833.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1916.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":696587100},{"amount":17.01,"local_amount":1558.47,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1629.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":711505365},{"amount":126.96,"local_amount":11391.15,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":11908.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.33,"payment_id":731022225}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T20:09:26Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":777645,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Delia is 41 years old and has three children.

She owns a grocery selling beers, sodas and waters and secondly, she owns a charcoal store where she purchases bags of charcoal, puts it in small sacks and resells it. Salama works from 07:30am to midnight each working day and is able to make a good profit each month.\r\n\r\nThis is her second credit request from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous credit, since repaid, to buy sacks of charcoal and drinks. She managed her previous credit for her business well, and got extra income. She used the profit to cover school fees, household expenses and saved for unforeseen events. She is happy with Kiva's support. In the coming years, Salama would like to grow her businesses and become better off in life. \r\n\r\nSalama will use her new request to restock her both businesses. She will share this loan with her loan group,Wazo Tegeta which consist of two members. The group members will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

He owns three acres of land, and has employed one full-time worker to help him to run the mixed-farm. He grows maize that he harvests once annually. He also keeps dairy cows that provide him with regular income through out the year.\r\n\r\nKimeli is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. The additional cow will produce more milk for the farmer to sell.

This group is starting its second loan cycle with Kiva, and they report that the previous loan cycle was successful. \r\n\r\nPetronila is the treasurer of the Trust Bank. She is single and has a 16-year-old son who attends school. Having completed three years of primary school, she is very pleased that her son is receiving an education and therefore will have more opportunities. This hardworking woman produces and sells traditional textiles. She currently employs five other female weavers who produce the textiles. The demand for her beautiful handmade goods motivates her to hire additional weavers, and purchase thread and supplies in order to diversify her products and increase sales. Therefore, she is requesting a new loan from Kiva. \r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank benefit immensely from the educational sessions at their monthly meetings. During the Friendship Bridge meetings, they acquire new personal and business tools that enable them to gain more self-confidence and self-esteem. The combination of the loans and education, which Friendship Bridge calls \u201cMicrocredit Plus,\u201d is very effective for the ladies to empower themselves. Petronila and the women of \u201cLas Florecitas\u201d are very appreciative of the generosity Kiva investors show in funding their loans, and look forward to a brighter future for themselves, their families and their community in Chichi.

Friendship Bridge.  Virginia, a 22-year old single woman, is a member of the Trust Bank who dreams of creating a better and more prosperous future. \r\n\r\nThe owner of a textile business, Virginia has been creating traditional clothing since she was a child. Because San Marcos attracts tourists, Virginia wants to have plenty of inventory on hand so that she can earn income to help support her family. Her biggest dream is to save money in order to return to school and at least finish her secondary education. She plans to use her loan to purchase a wide variety of threads with the goal of improving her textile production.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank have improved their quality of life not only because of the small loans they have received but also because of their increased knowledge about a variety of subjects. A portion of their monthly meetings is set aside for educational purposes. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares relevant and useful information with the ladies on a wide variety of subjects including preventative health, nutrition, hygiene, self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. The ladies learn how to use their loans most effectively as they learn about business planning, budgeting, accounting, marketing and customer service. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. \r\n\r\nVirginia and her friends in the \u201cKakchiquel San Marcos\u201d Trust Bank thank KIVA investors for their loans. They face a brighter tomorrow as empowered women eliminating poverty.  We will report again on their progress!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1705527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

Her husband is a salesman in a store.  They have four children from this marriage.  One lives with her and the others are working and live elsewhere.   \r\n\r\nClaudia works at housework at home.  Previously, she ran the store together with her husband but becauses of probelms they closed their store. Now they want to open the store again.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is seeking from CREDICAMPO is to buy soft drinks, doughnuts, sweets and cookies to stock the store, since with the previous loan they were unable to get much because they were just starting the business and had to see if the store would do well  in this location.  She has discovered that, yes,  this is a good place for sales; so now she will provide more things that the young people are looking for, but also items frolm the basic food basket like oil, rice, beans, sugar and eggs.  These are things that are sold daily because people use them a lot; this will help the business..  They have missed having the store that they closed due to other people's problems but now those people aren't around, so they have the store going and little by little will be able to stock it more and more completely.  \r\n\r\nClaudia's dream is to succeed in running their store again, since before she, her son and her husband were very happy with this income.

Luh Putu, the group head, purchased piglets with her loan and raised them over several months, during which they became large and healthy.  At the end of the loan period, Luh Putu sold her pigs for 1,100,000 IDR each, yielding a respectable profit.  With her profits, and with the help of a new loan from MUK, she plans to purchase additional pigs.  With the overall increase in household income, she has supported the daily needs of her family and is saving for sudden needs.\n\nThe Tanjung Rijasa Group got a loan for the second time. There are 10 members and the total loan is 20.000.000 IDR. (Two member couldn't attend the meeting because of illness.)  Having been successful with fattening pigs, Luh Putu used this loan to purchase four types of local pigs for pork roll and will maintain them for two months. The remainder of the loan will be used to buy feed. The price of pig feed is currently very expensive, but she remains optimistic about her business going forward. With her profits, she plans to repair her home and also invest in her pig business.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1704753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase four types of local pigs and feed for them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-10-06T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-05T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luh Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":20000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1650,"local_amount":20000000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-22T11:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":20120100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636272950}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T03:26:42Z","paid_date":"2015-04-22T11:02:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":776695,"name":"Jorge","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jorge is grateful that he was granted a PHP 50,000 loan which he used to buy sacks of rice needed in his wholesale\/retail rice business.

is 45 years old, married, and has one child. She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband is a turner by profession. He works over a lathe machine and manufactures and renews the spare parts of vehicles, such as motorbikes, motor cars, and auto rickshaws, which he has been doing for many years. He renews the interior parts of engines of vehicles, including the turbine and radiators. Up to now, his business has been very steady, but due to continuously working over the lathe machine, some important parts have been tearing off and urgently need to be replaced. Without the replacement of parts, the whole mechanism of the lathe machine is affected.\r\n\r\nKausar's husband is a poor person and does not have sufficient cash to buy spare parts to fix the lathe machine or buy cutting tools. Kausar requested a loan from BRAC Pakistan for her husband, which he will use to fix the lathe machine and buy cutting tools to work over the lathe machine.
