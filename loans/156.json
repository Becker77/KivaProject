He is 23 years old. He has been raising livestock for five years. He has a few head of cattle, and they must have high quality feed. Because of that he decided to buy hay and pre-mixed complete feed. Having a stock of that feed will result in well finished animals. To do this he contacted us about receiving a loan. The loan will be repaid over 12 months. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":229086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Complete feed supply","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vakhsh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.710833 68.831111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Snat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":583.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":595.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10230621},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20428626},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27122403},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36017765},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44601809},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52996382},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63217605},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73646923},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87086351},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-18T09:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97002125},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-20T09:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":297.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846993}],"funded_date":"2009-01-06T19:39:58Z","paid_date":"2009-12-20T09:22:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":79811,"name":"Srey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mrs. Srey C. is 40 years old, married, and has five children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She lives with her partner and their three children in a house inherited from her parents-in-law. She became a mother at the age of 15--having a baby made her become a responsible woman. With her little daughter on her back she worked in the fields for her neighbours alongside her husband. She was paid 8 soles a day; he earned 12 soles. \r\n\r\nLater they decided to rent fields and grow their own crops, beginning with 764 m2 of potatoes. They had good harvests which allowed them to save enough money to buy their own land. Since then they have planted potatoes and peas every year. To achieve this Mercedes\u2019 husband goes to their fields very early every morning, and she follows along soon afterwards with lunch, happy because she enjoys working the land. Mercedes is convinced that farming will enable them to get ahead; she wants to buy more arable land so they don\u2019t have to spend money on renting it. \r\n\r\nAs a new member of MFP (which incorporated as a community bank and is already on its tenth loan cycle), Mercedes has committed to repaying all loan instalments and is looking forward to saving together with the rest of her group. The loan will be used to buy chemical fertilizers to put on her potato crop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":349417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-09T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1065.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959559}],"funded_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:43Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":124867,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort H. sells African wear, such as beads and other African jewelry, at the Castle.

She decided to set up her own soft-drink selling business in a well-apportioned area of her home.  She administers her store with no boss nor schedule.  She tells us that she began with 300 soles and bought 5 packages of soft-drinks.  She saw that she did well and, little by little, started to invest more.  Currently, she is in the same line of work and is well-known by her customers who are her neighbors, family members, and friends.  With this 1500 sol loan she will buy more soft-drinks: packages of soft-drinks in various flavors, sizes, and brands, as well as mineral water, both sparkling and still.

She is 51 years old. Ruth is the group leader for a two-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Ruth owns and operates a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing new clothing like blouses, skirts, pants etc. to local community members. Ruth has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 1,200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Ruth joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for her business. This loan will be Ruth's fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She has had her business for 5 years, starting with Esperanza's first loan. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business (a vegetables stand) by buying vegetables and fruit such as plantains, bananas, cassava, yams, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and others. She will use the profits to put aside savings and take care of her hearth; she wishes to have a peaceful life. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to have a business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and its sugar cane industry,where the main economic activity is Free Trading Zone, a cement factory, and others. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and uncertain electricity.

They buy animals such as pigs, cows, rams at livestock fairs and various farms and sell the meat at the Quinua central market.

for its comprehensive support and assistance in the financing of its borrowers. Thanks to your efforts Davronbek is successfully growing his cattle breeding business which allowed him to pay off his first Kiva loan without delinquencies.\r\n\r\nDavronbek was born in the town of Osh in the Osh province of the Kyrgyz Republic. He is married and is raising two children.\r\n\r\nDavronbek was born in the family of a farmer. Since childhood Davronbek helped his father take care of the cattle. At that time his father had a large household and needed help and this is why Davronbek got used to this type of business and dreamed that when he grew up he will also have his own cattle business.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from school Davronbek went to serve in the army. In 1995 when he was 23 years old Davronbek got married and in the same year his first son was born. Later in 1998 he had a daughter. \r\n\r\nDuring the first years Davronbek lived with his family and in his parents' home. Gradually by breeding and selling large horned cattle he was able to save money. In 2002 he decided to invest the money in purchase of his own house in the village of Chaldovar in the Panfilovsky region, Chuysk Province, Republic of Kyrgyzstan where he moved to live. In some time his parents sold out all their cattle and bought a house in the village of Chaldovar where they moved to live not far from their son.\r\n\r\nAt this time because of his entrepreneurship and tenacity Devronbek has five milk cows and two calves. For the purpose of increasing the headcount of cattle Davronbek has come to Bai-Tushum and Partners to take out a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS. Davronbek dreams to buy a house in the town of Karabalta and move there in the future because the town has good schools, a hospital and a cattle market.\r\n\r\nZAO MFK Bai Tushum & Partners provides loans through Kiva for socially vulnerable population regions.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":36012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Homemade incense production - harvesting expenses, storage jars, and transportation to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Nder","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.255 -15.887222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-05-28T17:06:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-12T00:47:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:15:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27570},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T17:26:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34397},{"amount":102,"local_amount":102,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":102,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41425},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50162},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63303},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80000},{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:27:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106851},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136682},{"amount":164,"local_amount":164,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":164,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170171},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197317},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224307}],"funded_date":"2007-05-29T00:47:45Z","paid_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14267,"name":"Zebo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zebo is a 29 years old teacher, married with two children.

She was obliged at an early age to try many different business activities to earn an income. Twenty years ago, after a number of set-backs, she decided  to specialize in the sale of the latest soft drinks and ice.<p>\r\nShe has had an association with the Soro Yiriwaso microbank for three (3) years and has made three (3) group loans as part of a neighborhood association and two (2) personal loans. All of these have been successfully repaid. With this new loan, she plans to buy 12 crates of soft drinks, a motor for her refrigerator (the one she started the business with), and a push cart to transport the ice and soft drink crates. Her business is increasing each day, with sales being made from her home, at the market, and door-to-door to a wide variety of clients.<p>\r\nWith this loan Mrs.Toure expects to earn a monthly profit of 42,000 francs CFA which will be used mainly to increase her operating fund. In the future she would like to open a soft drink warehouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva

In 1996, she became a member of the TYM Fund and borrowed money to buy fishing nets.  Since 2003, she and her family have invested capital in raising animals to improve their financial situation.  Today, Mrs. \u0110\u00e0o and her husband raise both sows and porkers (pigs raised for meat) by their house, and their children all have steady employment.  The total family income is now about 3,000,000 VND (180 USD) per month and the financial situation of the family is steadily becoming more secure.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (600 USD) to purchase more breeding pigs and animal feed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

Suraiyo is a 36-year-old mother whose husband has no fixed income. So, to cover day-to-day necessities, she processes and sells dried apricots with the help of her elder son. She uses all the money she makes to care for her three children and provide for their education. Suraiyo has 15 years of experience processing and selling dried apricots. She is very polite and considerate, and her clients are always very happy with the service they receive from her. Because her business is doing so well, she is increasing her net worth month by month. Today Suraiyo requests $1200 USD to purchase more dried apricots to process and increase her range of goods. Suraiyo and her son express their gratitude for everyone supporting them and they promise to repay their loan in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Anar\u2019s family is a typical Kyrgyz family with average income. Anar is a seamstress, while her husband is a construction worker.

This is a slow time for Anar\u2019s sewing business, which allowed her to get involved in repairing the local high school. The school was built several decades ago, and is currently in a deplorable condition. Anar, along with other residents of the town, have invested some of their savings in repairing the school building. Presently, the construction is coming to an end. Anar plans to purchase building materials for the roof. With this purpose she approached Kiva lenders. She believes it\u2019s noble work and promises to repay the loan on time without any violations. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She began four years ago helping a neighbor to sell shoes and later decided to sell them on her own obtaining good results.\r\n\r\nLeonor started the business because back then her desire was to have a business in her home and that way be able to give the necessary attention to her children.  It's for that reason that approximately 15 years ago she started making and selling arrangements and handicrafts for holidays.

She's grateful to Afodenic for giving her the chance to borrow money for a business that has allowed her to get ahead in the world and have an income that she can use to help support her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":369661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-08-15T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaura Suyen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.89,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":795.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86965339},{"amount":38.84,"local_amount":776.71,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":794.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875792},{"amount":34.77,"local_amount":695.4,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":711.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713714},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3834.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601406}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T03:51:54Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":133125,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Vilma H., 36 years old, from Malibay, Pasay City.

(together we succeed) based in the rural area surrounding La Romana, an area where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable at best. Here he makes his home with his wife and three teenage children in a modest home of wooden walls and a tin roof. \r\n\r\nHe came to Esperanza a year and a half ago, because he felt that our interest rates and services were significantly lower than the moneylenders in his neighborhood. He has successfully completed two loan cycles with Esperanza and is now requesting his third loan. With this loan he intends to purchase more clothing in bulk, which will cost less and allow him to gain more profits. This will support his business of selling clothing for adults from his home, a trade which he has been successfully plying for over a year now. He will use the profits from his business, which is his family's primary source of income, to purchase better food and school supplies for the children, to paint his house (an important first line defense against termites and weather) and if there is some money left over he would like to purchase a television for his family to enjoy (when there is power of course). His long term goal is to continue growing his business and provide a stable income in the future. He thanks you all for your support.

After the rainy season, the harvest will be warehoused long enough for its value to increase, before it is sold at the great market in San and at the nearby markets, retail (or often wholesale) for cash to customers who mostly come from big towns.\r\n\r\nAfter their produce is sold, the members of Wolale VII Group expect to make a profit of 11,000 to 13,000 CFA francs each, which they will use to pay the interest on the loan and ongoing family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":570821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy farming supplies, seeds and small equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Cinzara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zele","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pere","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussokoro  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnere ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pere Keferi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Chaka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":330000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":330000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":330000,"processed_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":330212.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917851}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T00:47:42Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":219987,"name":"F\u00e1tima Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora F\u00e1tima es madre soltera de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, el peque\u00f1o estudia la primaria, ella se dedica  a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, y as\u00ed mismo es asalariada de una zona franca, con sus ahorros fue que consigui\u00f3 el dinero necesario para empezar su peque\u00f1o negocio el cual hoy en d\u00eda le representa un ingreso importante en su vida.\n\nElla habita en una casa humilde que ha construido de su esfuerzo propio, pero las limitaciones econ\u00f3micas no le permiten terminar las edificaciones de las regeneraciones de su vivienda, es por esta raz\u00f3n que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n, esta inversi\u00f3n le beneficiara al desarrollo optimo de su peque\u00f1o hijo sobretodo que no tiene a ning\u00fan familiar que le apoye econ\u00f3micamente.\n","en":"F\u00e1tima is a thirty-year-old single mother.

M. is a 32-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store business. She lives in Brgy. Guiwang, Alcoy, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).  \r\n\r\nSalvacion is now borrowing 11,000 PHP so that she can purchase more goods for her general store. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nSalvacion aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She has had her business for five years, starting when she first decided to sell clothes and bought a bag of used clothing. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying more clothes. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to respond to her household's needs.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate set out with us because she wanted to start a business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and the tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

He lives with his four wives and their children in Medine, a popular quarter in the village of Sikasso (third administrative region in the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nAfter having tried many different business activities without success, notably agriculture and others, he soon started out the business of storage and sale of sweet peas, shea nuts, and cereal grains. He has been 10 years in the business. With this great amount of experience in the field, he enjoys a solid reputation and fame, and he receives many out of country orders. But he lacks the necessary resources to satisfy the demand.\r\n\r\nTherefore he joined Soro Yiriwaso (Kiva Field Partner) two years ago and since then he has accessed three loans, all of which were successfully repaid. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of satisfying the demand of an ever growing clientele, he requests a fourth loan from the institution. He will be able to purchase 10 sacks of sweet peas, 3 tons of corn, 5 sacks of millet, and 10 sacks of shea nuts. \r\n\r\nHe makes his purchases in the surrounding regions of Sikasso and he stores the products in his store located in the new market of Medine Sikasso.

He is willing to work really hard to see his business flourish in the future. \r\n \r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Since he began this business he has always thought about satisfying the food needs of the neighboring homes, because before he began his store the housewives didn't have a place to go and buy things that were affordable, on a small scale and, most importantly, very close to home.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to add a great selection of things, until he becomes a warehouse. He would also like to get a site to construct a building for a granary. Meanwhile, he works long shifts every day and maintains a profit margin of at least 20% to meet his personal and familial goals. \r\n\r\nWith his Kiva loan, which is his first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, he will buy food, provisions, meat, drinks and liquor to stock his store and increase his business capital. With this cash purchase, he will be able to maintain prices for his customers and get better profits from his business, which guarantees the success of this investment.

It is here we find Luz, who is 31 and single, but has five children from a long-term relationship. One is full grown, while the other four are still in school. They all live in Colombia, where she lived for many years but for personal reasons left to return to this beautiful city. Luz, to earn her daily bread and to make headway in a honorable way, decided to open a small restaurant in the city more than two years ago. She prepares a variety of meals enjoyed by the customers who day-to-day visit her restaurant, selling lunches and dishes a la carte. She works every day and is helped by another person whom she pays. Luz is very content with her business since she loves to cook, and everything she prepares is done with a lot of love, which make her meals even more delicious.

She joins the Fund since the very beginning. Her living circumstance at that time was very difficult. She and her husband only worked on the rice field and they had to send 5 children to school. At first, she borrowed 50 USD and used it in breeding animals, and selling vegetables in the market. Her life started changing when she bought a piece of land and started breeding animals, fishes and planting. After difficult years, her business is going very well. When I came down to see her, she just released a farrow of pigs and earned 1000 USD. Currently, there are 4 pigs and tons of fishes almost ready. Business is going well, her family economy is becoming stable. Her children are all grown-up and living separately. Being 58 years old, she is having a happy life. She wants to become a long-term member of the Fund so that she can borrow more money to expand her business. This time she wants to borrow 950 USD to buy more fishes and food for pigs. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nL\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean cao tu\u1ed5i nh\u1ea5t trong c\u1ee5m nh\u01b0ng ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ho\u00e0 lu\u00f4n l\u00e0 t\u1ea5m g\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111i\u1ec3n h\u00ecnh v\u1ec1 s\u1ef1 c\u1ea7n c\u00f9, ch\u1ecbu kh\u00f3 v\u00e0 s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng v\u1ed1n r\u1ea5t c\u00f3 hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3.

Lucy T. is 53 years old and she is from Tukuyu. She is divorced with 2 children, who are 26 and 30. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant, who is an orphan.  \r\n\r\nLucy has earned a living running a charcoal business since 1995. These small, black, and dirty pieces of dry earth provide a good way of life for charcoal sellers, and are crucial to those who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots to cook, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford.\r\n\r\nLucy works at her business 8 hours per day, 7 days per week. Lucy currently earns about $500 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $325 USD in order to purchase additional stock of charcoal. In the future, she plans to increase the amount of charcoal she sells and open another store. Lucy thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":255958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Utilities","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of charcoal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T16:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy H.

To get high profits Inomiddin goes out to wholesale markets very far outside of where he lives and buys several heads of cattle in wholesale. If it's possible then he resells the live cattle, but if not then he butchers it and sells in his butcher shop. He has been working with MicroInvest for two years, and is very happy with the loan terms so he decided to apply for a new loan to buy a few heads of calves.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":300221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To expand business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inomiddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1117.93},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1153.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1189.86},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.54},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.41},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1306.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1347.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1390.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.34},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":332.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.96},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":353.82},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":293.46,"local_amount":1117.93,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1121.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599873},{"amount":302.75,"local_amount":1153.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994308},{"amount":312.34,"local_amount":1189.86,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1193.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215581},{"amount":322.23,"local_amount":1227.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1231.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645072},{"amount":332.43,"local_amount":1266.41,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084596},{"amount":342.96,"local_amount":1306.51,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1310.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000823},{"amount":353.82,"local_amount":1347.88,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1352.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846207},{"amount":365.01,"local_amount":1390.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1394.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737310}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T19:54:41Z","paid_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":104435,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Flora, es Socia del Banco Comunal Manuela Ramos , que est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Mazo-Cruz Provincia del collao, Departamento de Puno.

She wants to do this to compete with other stores that are nearby. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":545805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy t-shirts, jeans, jackets, and other items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Coronel Oviedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.416667 -56.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":15335056,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":958441},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":958441}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2234.38,"local_amount":10542851,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10590937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151898321},{"amount":812.5,"local_amount":3833764,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3851250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638564},{"amount":203.12,"local_amount":958441,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":962812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852572}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T07:55:25Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:18:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":207713,"name":"Rosibeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosibeth C.

K. is married and has three children. She runs a small business selling clothing in the central market of Dushanbe. She has a variety of clothing products at reasonable prices. Mutabar started her venture six years ago and has achieved stability since then. She has many customers who  buy clothing from her because they know she does not sell low quality merchandise in her kiosk. Customer demand is constantly growing, which is why Mutabar decided to expand her trade. Mutabar's determination and desire to provide only the best quality products will help her grow professionally and increase her sales. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She anticipates being able to expand her business early next year.<p>\r\n\r\nJoyce's group is on their second loan cycle with this Micro-finance organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":876887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more retail commodities like maize flour, sugar, salt, beans, rice, etc. to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mityana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.4175 32.022778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-09-24T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asaph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sauda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ssemakula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mega","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1333333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1333333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1333333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1333333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1333333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":479.17,"local_amount":1333333.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1336874.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868722},{"amount":479.16,"local_amount":1333333.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1336875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648558},{"amount":479.17,"local_amount":1333333.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1336874.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313895},{"amount":479.17,"local_amount":1333333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1336875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275490},{"amount":479.16,"local_amount":1333333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1336874.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223613},{"amount":479.17,"local_amount":1333333.35,"processed_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-10T08:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1336875.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270319229}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T03:28:14Z","paid_date":"2012-05-10T08:12:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":342963,"name":"Gwendolyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gwendolyn is 37, married and has four school-age children.

Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y espera que su permanencia dentro de su grupo sea de gran provecho. El dinero que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de mercader\u00eda para abastecer su negocio de nuevos y necesarios productos para sus clientes.","en":"Leonor, a widow at 45, is responsible for watching over her small daughter.  With help from her parents, who give her a place to live, Leonar tries to give her daughter the best living conditions.  \r\n\r\nShe is determined to convert her store into a book store so the school children of the zone can find all the educational materials they need.  For now she is working hard in her business.  She just finished having a public telephone installed, and that will help her attract people to her store.  It will also make her known in the area.  \r\n\r\nHer problem is the rental cost of her business location, which she has been in for 4 years.  Meanwhile, she will keep working, like always, to kindly tend to her customers and offer them what they need at all times.  Her business is open from seven in the morning until ten at night.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She hopes that staying in the group will be very beneficial.  She will use the money to buy merchandise to stock her business with new and needed products for her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her customers know her for her charisma and attentiveness.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe constructed a corral specifically for raising cattle in the field outside of her home.  Her main customers are butchers who have their own meat vending stalls at the city market.  With her loan of 1000 soles, she will buy 3 heads of beef cattle that she will raise for future sale.\r\n<p> \r\nSra. Belcka is happy with the service offered by Manuela Ramos.  She is thankful that the institution supports women like her who want to work and get ahead.  She hopes to continue her membership for a long time so that she can help other women entrepreneurs.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":369758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase 3 heads of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belcka Marilyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":171.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635646},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":166.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":170.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074760},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":170.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990115},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":166.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835016},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":166.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":170.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726863},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":170.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117443}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T13:57:08Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":133157,"name":"Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres de nombre Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora, se conform\u00f3 en fecha 03 de agosto del 2006, gracias a que la actual Directora General, la Sra.

He is married and the father of a family with 8 children, of whom 3 are still in his charge. Manuel is a farmer with 40 years in this activity. Now he plants coffee and raises cattle.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 15 he began helping his father. Manuel studied only to the 4th grade of primary school because his parents were very poor and he was one of 9 children. They couldn't pay for schooling for all the children, so he had to help his father to work and bring food to his home. At the age of 22, he decided to marry but it was difficult. He had to work twice as hard for 2 months to be able to afford a wedding dress for his wife. Then, his father sold him a small piece of land to work and he made it count, with the help of his wife. Later, he sold this piece of land to buy a larger plot and plant coffee, and also, raise cattle. Thus Manuel and his family have survived until the present. He hopes to sell his coffee directly to buyers in the United States.\r\n\r\nManuel requests a loan to maintain his 4.375 acres of coffee, to pay laborers, and to buy manure. This will help him to keep his harvest in good condition, and obtain a better production of coffee. He intends to buy more land in the future for planting coffee, using a highly technical system that will produce organic coffee. Among his short-term  goals is to sow 5.25 acres of beans and 3.5 acres of corn.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":749269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"TO FERTILIZE AND MAINTAIN 4.375 ACRES OF COFFEE TREES","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-04-12T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1172.86,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1172.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":1172.86,"processed_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242752}],"funded_date":"2011-04-19T13:00:12Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":293782,"name":"Ou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cultivating rice is part of 31-year-old Ou S.\u2019s daily routine.

She has two sources of income: selling merchandise, an activity she does sporadically, and tailoring.  The latter activity is the one that allows her to earn higher income and predict higher sales.  Dora Isabel learned tailoring from her mother and sister. She has worked with this sister for some time tailoring for third parties.  She states that the best season is the beginning of the year as they assign her a greater number of uniforms to make and she takes advantage of this season.  She wants to offer better services to her customers, so she is looking for a loan to buy a flat sewing machine.

The secret of her success is simple: she tries to not only let her customers know the benefits of her products\u2014she also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop where she is now with her venture. Khursheda is seeking a loan of 3500 Somoni to restock the merchandise in her store for the winter season.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When she first joined the Fund, her family depended on raising animals and growing crops for their income.  Today, in addition to raising animals, Mrs. N\u0103m also buys beans and peanuts in bulk from local farmers and sells them to consumers, and her husband works as a hired laborer.  With their current income of about 3,500,000 VND per month, the financial condition of her family is steadily becoming more secure.  In the next round of lending, Mrs. N\u0103m hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (575 USD) to invest in her business selling beans and peanuts.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert

This is a very agricultural region and economic activities are in buying and selling, livestock-raising, agriculture, handicrafts, etc. This has encouraged the women of the Bollo Ligu\u00e9ye group to go into commercial activities.

She is considered an astute businesswoman with regard to the lines of beauty products she has sold for the last 15 years. She consistently makes her sales goals, winning prizes for her good performance. This motivates her to continue working and to develop future sales projections. She enjoys being involved with her diverse customer base and being able to offer them beauty products.  Every day, starting at 8:00 in the morning, she leaves with a variety of catalogs to visit her customers. Late afternoons are dedicated to the distribution of orders and bill collection, something that is always more tedious for her.

D. A. is 41 and lives in Soyapango with her two adult children.  They are in college, and her husband works as a salesman.  Gladis sells clothing in the market in Soyapango.  She sells her products every day with the goal of helping her husband pay for their home's expenses since their two children are in college and this generates a rather high cost.  They are willing to pay for this for the well-being of their children.  She has sold clothing for eight years and has many customers who are very loyal to her.  This is why Gladis is requesting a loan, so she can increase the amount of products she has as well as her sales.  She will then be able to meet her customers' demand and obtain more customers so she can earn more profits and contribute to the family finances.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya
