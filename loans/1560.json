is a 38-year-old married hardworking woman who helps her family by providing tailoring services in her community. She wants to provide better opportunities for her children and she works extremely hard to keep her children smiling.\r\n\r\nShe started sewing clothes after the birth of her two children, when she observed that her husband couldn't provide everything necessary for them. Then she decided to start a tailoring business at home. She has been sewing clothes for her community and wants to enhance the beauty of her craft so she would like to buy a Juki industrial sewing machine. The professionals use this machine for tailoring because of its speed and fine performance.\r\n\r\nShe knows the techniques of tailoring very well. Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives, and the local community. She has requested a loan to buy a new Juki sewing machine and some packs of zippers and buttons to meet the increasing demand. \r\n\r\nAbida is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC

He is a businessman running a shop selling sugar, rice, beans, maize, baking flour, cooking oil and so on. He has been in this enterprise for ten years now; a business he has chosen as being good for his life. He works from 07:00am to 10:00pm daily and is able to make a fair monthly profit. \r\n\r\nHassan is a member of Furaha Tegeta, a group consisting of two members. The group members are of the same age and their dreams are to change their business and family welfare. As a group, they approached Tujijenge, a Kiva partner, and previously received some credits which showed some positive impact on their businesses. They believe that by receiving additional credit support, their businesses will grow and be in a good position. \r\n\r\nHassan used the previous credits, since repaid, to buy three acres of farmland which he needed to practice commercial farming.

She has six children (one son and daughters), two school-aged and the rest are grown up. She is married and has been supporting her family by running two food businesses. \r\n\r\nA restaurant is her first project, where she serves breakfast, lunch and supper foods. Secondly, she has a Grocery, selling spirits, soft drinks and beers. In her restaurant, she also provides catering services. \r\n\r\nShe is really an entrepreneurial mother and has been in these businesses since 1982. She runs all her businesses from the same place, as she said it's easier for management. Despite the two food projects, she also raises local chickens at home for sale. Virginia has business helpers and works from 05:00am to10:00pm each working day. She is able to make a very good return per day.\r\n\r\nShe is now requesting her more than 10th credit cycle via Tujijenge Tanzania. She successfully repaid the previous loans and used them to replenish her grocery with drinks, bought food and cooking ingredients.

30 a 35 minutos en autob\u00fas, durante el recorrido, se pueden observar kil\u00f3metros de plantaciones de ca\u00f1a y algunas casas. En el lugar, tambi\u00e9n hay cultivo de productos alternativos aunque la mayor\u00eda es de autoconsumo, la ca\u00f1a representa el mayor ingreso para la poblaci\u00f3n, basta mencionar que en el lugar se ubica un ingenio que es la mayor fuente de empleo, especialmente durante el periodo de corte de ca\u00f1a. \n\nBrisa De Mar es un grupo  conformado por  7 personas, trabajadoras, emp\u00e1ticas, amables, carism\u00e1ticas y lo mejor de todo: cada una de ellas tiene una actividad econ\u00f3mica. Los integrantes comentan que el nombre lo eligieron por una novela mexicana muy famosa. Las integrantes y sus actividades son: \n\nMary Cruz- Venta De Perfumes Y Abarrotes\nCristal-Estilista\nGloria-Venta De Refrescos\nIrma- Venta De Ropa\nAntonio-Servicio Mecanico \nEnriqueta-Cria Y Venta De Cerdos \nSandra-Calzado Por Catalogo \n\nCristal es una persona muy trabajadora, amable, carism\u00e1tica, alegre y comprensible la cual desde hace ya 15 a\u00f1os se ha dedicado al servicio de estilista aunque en un principio desempe\u00f1\u00f3 su actividad en Estados Unidos pues fue el lugar donde aprendi\u00f3 la actividad. Hace algunos a\u00f1os regreso a M\u00e9xico para cuidar a su madre quien viv\u00eda sola y enferm\u00f3. Ahora Cristal vive con ella y trabaja de lunes a s\u00e1bado de 8 am a 6pm.

La est\u00e9tica de Cristal ha funcionado desde hace siete a\u00f1os, la cual ha ido adecuando y ampliando para ofrecer un mejor servicio; ella sigue trabajando por citas para realizar cortes de cabello, te\u00f1ir, peinar, etc y su agenda siempre est\u00e1 llena pues siempre la buscan, especialmente si hay alg\u00fan evento. \n\nCristal necesita comprar tintes, per\u00f3xido, cera, peines, pasadores, crema, capas, tijeras, y de esta manera tener m\u00e1s producto para continuar trabajando.\n\n\"Gracias a los compa\u00f1eros del grupo por invitarme a formar parte de ellos y de esta manera ampliar mi est\u00e9tica\" fueron las palabras de Cristal.\n\n*En la imagen: Cristal viste blusa negra y pantal\u00f3n de mezclilla.\n","en":"\r\nTo get to the place where the Briso de Mar group lives, you have to travel 30-35 minutes by bus. During the journey you can see kilometers of sugar cane plantations and a few houses. Other crops are grown but they are mainly for consumption by the family. Sugar cane is the main source of income for the local people. Worth mentioning too is the sugar factory that is the main source of employment especially during the sugar cane harvest.\r\n\r\nBrisa de Mar is made up of seven people, all hardworking, kind, friendly, charismatic, in fact the best of everything. Each person has her\/his own business. The group's name was chosen because it is the name of a very famous Mexican novel.\r\n\r\nHere are the names of the members and their jobs:\r\nMary Cruz--sells perfume and groceries\r\nCristal--beauty salon\r\nGloria--sells soft drinks\r\nIrma--sells clothing\r\nAntonio--mechanic\r\nEnriqueta--raises and sells pigs\r\nSandra--sells footwear from a catalog\r\n\r\nCristal is a very hardworking, friendly, charismatic, lively and easy to understand person. Since she was 15 years old she has been a hair stylist, working at one time in the USA where she learned about hairdressing. A few years ago she returned to Mexico to look after her mother who was ill and living alone. Now Crystal lives with her. She works from 8am to 6 pm. Her dream had been to live overseas, a dream she has now accomplished. She is now concentrating on her mother's wellbeing and happiness. This is her main motivation for working so hard.\r\n\r\nCrystal's salon has been running for seven years, and in that time she has improved and expanded it. She accepts appointments for hair cuts, colour, and hair styles--and her appointments book is always full especially if there is a special event.\r\n\r\nCristal needs to buy dyes, peroxide, wax, combs, bobby pins, lotions, capes and scissors. Then she will be able to continue her work. \"I thank my friends in the group for inviting me to join them so that I can grow my business,\" says Crystal.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":1683998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She is a persevering young woman, who from a young age was raised by her uncle since her parents emigrated to another county to be able to give her a better future. At present, she is in her second year of her university degree, studying business administration. She is single and doesn\u2019t have any children.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort and with the help of her parents, Ilcia was able to start her own business selling clothes for people of all ages and for men, women, and babies. She has already had this business for two years, and so far, it has gone very well for her. She has experience in this work and feels capable of growing her business little by little.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy more clothes for women, men, and children and to sell the clothing through her business.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to have a store that is in a strategic location so that she has a good demand for her products.

She has a high school education and has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture for many years, a business she began from nothing. Thanks to her backbreaking effort and hard work, she has achieved great success in developing her farm and now brings in a monthly profit of 17,000 KGS.

It's a profession worth admiring and one that men dedicate years and even their whole lives to.  Land without a farmer's labor cultivating it wouldn't bear the fruits that sustain the generations.  This is the work that Manuel does.  He is 53-years old, single and has twelve children.  His first four children have their own families now, the next two help Manuel in his work, and the last six are excellent students at their community's school. \r\n\r\nManuel works as a farmer every day under an exhausting sun.  He has done this work for fifteen years.  The work has generated an income that has improved his family's standard of living.  Manuel is a visionary, and that is why he sells his products in his country's various departments. \r\n\r\nThe loan is intended for purchasing fertilizer so Manuel can get a good harvest and earn a better income.  He will then be able to improve his family's and his community's standard of living even further.  One of Manuel's greatest aspirations is to see his children become professionals in various work environments and to purchase a plot of land to leave his children something nice to remember him by.

It is a craft worthy of admiration that woman work at for years and for life. The earth without the labor of women farmers dedicated to cultivating the earth will not give fruit to sustain a whole generation. This is the work that Noelia, 19 years of age and with 1 child who is only a year old, performs. (Noelia is the woman found second from the right in the photo.)\r\n\r\nShe plants corn, and has been doing this work for more than 4 years. She chose this work because she has the right land and climate for the planting of corn. She generates very good earnings for herself. Her second job is selling spare parts in her community, always with the vision of helping her neighbors in her community.\r\n\r\nShe has become a great example in her community; because of this, a group of enterprising women have united with Noelia to set off together with her to be successful in the future and to have income for their families.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan for fertilizers to grow corn, as fertilizers are indispensable to obtaining a good harvest. One of Noelia's goals is to increase her corn production and to improve her management practices in the growing of

She makes enough through her business to contribute to the family income. She also sells milk to generate an extra amount of income. She needs to improve her business to bear her household expenses. However, due to the unavailability of funds, she is not able to expand her business. For this reason, she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of 45,000 PKR to purchase animals. She is very experienced and has good contacts in the market. With this loan, she will definitely expand her business and increase her income level.

She is liable to provide them with good quality food, health care and clothing. To improve her business, she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of 50,000 PKR.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

This got me interested in woodcarving, and I also did well in art classes at school. After graduation, I decided to go back and assist the carvers. Even though they couldn't pay me much, I felt happy and satisfied, and was glad to go to work with each new day. Now I work on my own. The most challenging part of this craft is when am designing my work, and the nicest part is when I mix colors to paint.

It has become difficult to find a local market for the items we craft. Being able to sell on the web not only provides a steady cash flow for me and my family, it helps ensure that our art will continue to be appreciated and gives meaning to what we do.
