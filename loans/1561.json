She is 45 years old and has children. Rodrigo, her husband, works as a driver. She oversees the operation of their Jeepney unit, and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which she is paid *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,500 every day. Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippine.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan assistance to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her Jeepney unit. She will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Teresita wants to have more units of Jeepney to be used for their business operation. She hopes that her children will be able to complete their studies and then find right-fit jobs. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Here he has had his small ornamentation workshop since the year 1998. From a very young age, he learned this trade, and because he liked it so much, he took a course to be able to open his workshop, where he makes fences and things from iron in general. \r\n\r\nHe does his work upon requests from his customers, to whom he sells his items on credit. For them, he works Monday through Saturday with a schedule that goes from 8am until 8pm. His purchases are made in cash, and his main customers are businesses and individuals who, little by little, he has won over as his loyal buyers.\r\n\r\nThese days, Robinson has set his goal to increase contracts with his customers, and later expand his workshop, all with the goal of earning more and improving his family's quality of life. He is asking for a Kiva loan, his first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which he will buy raw materials.

She will use it to buy picture frames, stuffed animals, cosmetics, and sweets, so she can take advantage of the end of the year, which will come with big parties and supplier discounts.

tipo de radiocomunicadores , negocio que actualmente realiza con empresas que compran estos servicios y con la comunidad donde habita, con las que le va muy bien. Como su esposo conoce la parte t\u00e9cnica de reparaci\u00f3n de tele comunicadores, ellos decidieron dar apertura a su negocio en el a\u00f1o 2009 y desde all\u00ed se dividieron el trabajo, \u00e9l trabajando la parte t\u00e9cnica y Grey en el \u00e1rea comercial, promoviendo el servicio mediante visitas a las empresas, para ofrecerlo. Su meta es tener un taller m\u00e1s amplio y contar con nuevos trabajadores, con el fin de generar m\u00e1s ingresos y lograr profesionalizar a sus hijos en las edades de 3, 14 y 17 a\u00f1os. En el taller de esta pareja, se realizan mantenimiento y reparaciones de radios, micr\u00f3fonos y accesorios afines, lo cual realiza de contado y a cr\u00e9dito trabajando todos los d\u00edas, desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde. Su desaf\u00edo es generar todos los d\u00edas nuevos clientes  y justamente debe tener en sus inventarios de todo un poco, para aventurarse a impactar nuevos mercados, Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n maro Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1, repuestos de radios, micr\u00f3fonos y otros accesorios, como insumos de su tarea y para comercializar entre nuevos clientes.

","en":"Grey began her experience in repairing all types of radio-communications devices 5 years ago. She now works with other businesses, who purchase her services, and in the community where she lives, and it is working very well. Since her husband knows the technical part of repairing telecommunications devices, they decided to open their business in 2009, and since then have shared the work. He works in the technical part, and Grey takes care of the commercial side, promoting their services by visiting businesses and describing their offer.\r\n\r\nTheir goal is to have a bigger workshop and hire new workers, in order to generate more income and provide a professional education for their children, who are now 3, 14, and 17 years old.\r\n\r\nIn this couple\u2019s workshop they provide maintenance and repair radios, microphones, and similar accessories, both paid on the spot and on credit. They work every day from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. Their personal challenge is to get new clients every day, and to do this they need a little of everything in their inventory, in order to reach new markets. \r\n\r\nFor this reason they are seeking a credikiva loan, a first source of financing offered by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. The loan will be used to buy radio parts, microphones and other accessories, the materials needed in their work and in order to market to new clients. This investment will improve their business because they will have new parts for sale and new radios to offer. Their client market will be much more dynamic, making this credikiva a successful investment.

She is 32 years old and has children who are currently in school. Cristopher, her husband, works as a driver. She oversees the operation of their Jeepney, and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which she is paid a *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,500 every day. Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippine. \r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay. \r\n\r\nMa. Luisa is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan assistance to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her Jeepney. She will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ma. Luisa hopes that her business will continue to operate and help provide for their everyday needs. She dreams for her children to finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1706522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for spare parts and the maintenance of their jeepney.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-07T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-06T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

With the support from this loan, she hopes that it will help to increase her family income. \r\n\r\nShe would like to thank all lenders for their financial support toward poor people.

businesses, including farms, small stores, door-to-door sales and food selling. Agung Ayu heads the group and earns a living by selling crops and breeding pigs. She successfully manages both of her businesses and earns good profits. Two members of this group recently left because they now have sufficient capital, but the fourteen remaining members are requesting a loan for 20,000,000 IDR to improve their business.

He lives with his spouse and his small child who is a year old in the town of Soledad. There he has been in hairdressing since he was 16 years old, responding to his aptitude for business that he has had since he was very young. First he had a store and later he sold it, as his sales had diminished and he didn't see it as a business that would generate much profit. Worried about losing capital, he gave the money to his wife to sell beauty products and start a beauty parlor, taking advantage of her experience working in beauty salons. Today he works every day from 8:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. selling specialized wholesale beauty supplies, which is most economical, on credit and cash. His goal to move forward in life is to have 3 branches and to be able to achieve having his own housing to generate greater prosperity for his spouse and his son. Today he is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing he has done with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy 5 hairdressing chairs, a shampoo chair, an air conditioner and beauty products.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by buying  supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. Jun has a charming personality so people prefer to buy at his store. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business he is requesting a PHP 25,000, loan which he will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, corn rice, charcoal, sugar, cooking oil, and beverages. He also retails prepaid loads of mobile phones. He is positive this will boost his income as he expands his business. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him.\r\n\r\nJun aims to grow his business to give his family a better life. He wants to give his children the best education possible. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Desde que conoci\u00f3 a su esposo, Juana comenz\u00f3 a elaborar hermosas piezas de resina, actividad iniciada por sus suegros y su esposo hace 14 a\u00f1os. Anteriormente, ellos se dedicaban a la compra y venta de l\u00e1mparas y sal\u00edan a diferentes puntos de la rep\u00fablica Mexicana, pero en la capital encontraron a una persona que creaba artesan\u00eda de resina y decidieron invertir en ella. Entonces, comenzaron a vender en los mismos puntos donde ya vend\u00edan sus l\u00e1mparas. Posteriormente comenzaron a comprar la materia prima para crear ellos mismos las figuras que quisieran; peque\u00f1as r\u00e9plicas de la Diana cazadora, b\u00fahos para licenciados, \u00e1guilas, Cristos, \u00e1ngeles, etc\u00e9tera.

La \u00fanica dificultad que enfrenta es la falta de dinero para comprar m\u00e1s moldes, pues cada uno cuesta entre 500 y 600 pesos, dependiendo del tama\u00f1o.

They would hate for their origins to be lost and for this reason teach their grandchildren all they can about their culture. \r\n\r\nJuana is 30 years old and has been married to Jos\u00e9 Luis for 10 years. They have a three-year-old daughter named Maricruz. Since she met her husband, Juana has been elaborating beautiful works in resin, a craft that her parents-in-law and husband began 14 years ago. \r\n\r\nBefore, they made their living buying and selling lamps, traveling to different parts of the Mexican republic. Then, in the capital, they met someone who made objects out of resin, and decided to invest in these objects. They started selling the resin objects in the same places they used to sell lamps. Later, they began buying the raw materials to create the objects they wanted for themselves: small replicas of Diana the Huntress, owls for lawyers, eagles, figurines of Jesus Christ, angels, etc. Juana needs a loan to buy resin, paints and catalyst to make more pieces.\r\n\t\r\nJuanita, as they affectionately call her, explains that she and her husband usually go out to sell their products for two whole months, sleeping in the car so they don\u2019t have to go back home.

Meet Gladys, 30, a mother of two who has defied the notion among her friends that farming is an old-fashioned way of earning a living. Her primary sources of income are milk, eggs and farming. Gladys hails from Kisii, Kenya, an area that enjoys favorable weather patterns that boost crop production in the area. Gladys, being someone who is very ambitious and someone who always takes advantage of positive things, would like to capitalize on the good weather patterns experienced in the region and boost her farming. Being a hardworking mother, Gladys has always ensured putting food on the table for her family. She also ensures she is able to take her children to school. Gladys detests living in conditions of poverty and she has a plan to improve her standard of living. This is why she is seeking a loan of 52,000 KES in order to be able to purchase a dairy cow. This will help in producing milk and manure to be used on her farm. Milk from the cow will be sold to the local market and this means improved cash flow. Through improved cash flow this means that profits will be higher and she can comfortably take care of her family and take her kids to school. Through your loan Gladys will be empowered economically and be able to improve her standard of living and also those of people living within the area. Gladys is very comfortable with the repayment plan and the monthly installments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1703067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-07T23:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-06T23:30:08Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3771.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3780.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3891.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4004.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4121.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4242.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4366.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4493.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4625.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4760.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4899.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5042.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.9},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.2,"local_amount":8077.27,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8308.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680902},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":4001.94,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4116.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194330},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":8124.97,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":8357.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823642},{"amount":49.28,"local_amount":4270.77,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4393.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264267},{"amount":317.59,"local_amount":27525.05,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28313.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600463}],"funded_date":"2014-10-08T17:51:29Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":775277,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David - a smallholder dairy farmer in Kapsowar, Kenya.

She is a super incredible farmer! She certainly ranks among the top successful smallholder farmers on Juhudi Kilimo's client list.\n\nBorn in 1976 into a humble family, Milcah's upbringing was difficult. She attended school and cleared secondary, after which she got into mixed farming 18 years ago. She also got married to a lovely husband who is 44 years old today. Together, they were blessed with 4 children.\n\nMilcah practices farming on a 30-acre farm that is owned by the family in the village of Sugoi. On the farm, she grows passion fruit, beans, millet, vegetables, soybeans and maize. She also keeps more than five highly productive dairy cows for milk production. The 38-year-old farmer sells her produce in bulk 5 kilometres away from her home. Her key clients are the Cereal Board, institutions and local people. She owns motorcycles that help in farm transportation.\n\nShe is such a good farmer that the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture picked her farm to be a model farm for other farmers. She is also a secretary of Emkwen Group, a group she formed to help members, who are smallholder farmers, to save and use the savings to access loans from financial institutions.\n\nMilcah is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to build a greenhouse and to build a cow shed. She needs greenhouse technology to continuously improve the productivity, profitability and sustainability of her major farming systems. A greenhouse will provide a favourable environment for her plants. It will also protect the plants from adverse climatic conditions such as wind, cold, precipitation, excessive radiation, extreme temperature, insects and diseases. The dairy unit will also greatly boost her dairy management as she slowly transitions to zero-grazing.\n\nWith your lending, Milcah will have a year-round production of crops and off-season production of vegetable and fruits. She will also save on the use of natural resources such as water. Water requirement of crops is very limited and easy to control with this technology.\n\nMilcah has a great credit history. In 2006, she took a KES 100,000 loan and successfully serviced it. She also took a second and a third loan of KES 40,000 and KES 80,000 in the years 2010 and 2012 respectively. This will be her fourth loan after successfully clearing the previous loans.\n\nShe stated that this loan will change her life.

She was born in La Paz - Bolivia and is the youngest of three sisters. She says that, because her mother could not have a stable job, she decided to leave the country in order to find one and send them a monthly amount to pay for household expenses, because their father had abandoned them long time ago. This is why, thanks to her mother's effort, Daniela was able to enter college to study what she is passionate about, which is the career of Ecology and Environmental Engineering. Currently, Daniela is at the end phase of her career, but sadly it is difficult for her to keep paying for college, because her mother got sick and had to return to the country and stop working. Daniela considers that she is different from others because of her perseverance to reach her goals. She is convinced that after she gets her title, her chances to enter the labor market will be better and this will allow her to help with household expenses. Her dream is to form part of a company whose purpose is to improve the flora and fauna of the country. Daniela is grateful to all the people who with their resources are able to help her fulfill her dreams, and who generate new opportunities of growth.

In this way Veronica wants to continue with her business in order to help her husband with the household expenses, and if possible she would like to buy a little house so that her children can have a better life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1703297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"San Gabriel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2014-10-08T02:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-07T02:20:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Silvia Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":72.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":77.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":78.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":80.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.93},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.96,"local_amount":72.96,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":72.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561648337},{"amount":75.78,"local_amount":75.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":75.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579562997},{"amount":78.22,"local_amount":78.22,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":78.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595160540},{"amount":80.7,"local_amount":80.7,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":80.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611781416},{"amount":80.81,"local_amount":80.81,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":80.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624846089},{"amount":83.84,"local_amount":83.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636491417},{"amount":83.72,"local_amount":83.72,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649758741},{"amount":86.49,"local_amount":86.49,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":86.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665248032},{"amount":357.48,"local_amount":357.48,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":357.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681554719}],"funded_date":"2014-10-10T05:17:14Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T17:44:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":778557,"name":"Leonorica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Leonorica works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a pig fattening business in the Philippines and earns additional income from farming rice.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The profits from the business will be used on his farming of domestic animals such as cows.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

","en":"Davlyatkhon is 43 years old and married.  She comes from the J.Rumy district of Tajikistan, where she lives with her son, daughter-in-law and their daughter.  Her son works as a taxi driver and her daughter-in-law helps Davlyatkhon with her own sewing business, which she started six years ago.  Davlyatkhon exclusively sews traditional Tajik dresses for women.  At the moment, she really needs a loan.  Her old house hasn't been repaired for several years and it is in bad condition.  Davlyatkhon plans to use the amount of her loan to perform some repairs in her house and to make it more comfortable.  Without this loan, she will not be able to carry out her plan and have her house ready for the winter.  She is relying solely on you.\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1704804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She learned her trade from her mother.  Her mother now works in agriculture and her father is also working.  Farzona has two younger siblings: a sister and a brother.  Her sister is still in school and her brother is a university student.  He is enrolled at the School of Finance and Credit of the Tajik National University.  Farzona's parents are currently not in a position to pay for their son's tuition.  Farzona wants to help her brother and see him pursue his studies.  For this reason, she is taking a loan of 1,500 USD.  She will use this loan to pay for her brother's annual tuition and to buy him the necessary school supplies.  This loan is very important to Farzona and her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1704851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is married to Aniceto and they have only one child who is in high school. She manages her own household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income to meet her family\u2019s daily personal and household needs.\r\n\r\nVioleta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying  supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 700 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy sacks of rice, beverages, canned goods, coffee and other grocery items to expand her product inventory. This will definitely boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nVioleta aims to grow her business to give her family a better life. She wants to send her child to college to get the best education. She prays for her family to stay happy and strong in the Lord. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1706767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a resident of Coron, Palawan,  Philippines. Maribeth manages her household while operating her business.  She works hard to continually provide income to meet her family\u2019s daily personal and household needs. \r\n\r\nMaribeth operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages, piecemeal to the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by buying  supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her general store has the complete items that a Filipino household usually needs everyday so people come to her store.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business and increase her sales Maribeth is requesting a loan for 32,000 PHP, which which she will use to buy groceries such as rice, biscuits, cooking oil, canned goods, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.  This will definitely boost her income as she expands her business.  Her earnings from her store will help greatly in providing for her family's daily needs and for the school needs of her child.\r\n \r\nMaribeth aims to expand her business so she can give her family a better life.  She wants to send her child to college and get the best education for her. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1706787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Esto ocurri\u00f3 en Febrero de hace 2 a\u00f1os, aprovechando su gran aptitud para la cocina, pues siempre le ha gustado cocinar y y puso al servicio de la comunidad su talento.

","en":"For Amarelys the fact that we all eat as it is a basic necessity which need to be filled whether we have money or not. This was the idea that led her to start her business of making and selling meals, especially lunches. This happened in February of two years ago, taking advantage of her strong  aptitude for cooking. She has always liked to cook and she opened this talent to the public as a service. <br \/><br \/>Previously she had a food service in another neighborhood and when she moved in to her mother-in-law's she started a restaurant business with her husband in this neighborhood selling sancocho (a traditional soup), small fast foods, sort drinks and other drinks. Her goal for the future is to have her own house and to improve the conditions of her restaurant expanding it to increase the potential amount of clients. <br \/><br \/>Currently she is applying for a loan from Kiva, the first loan she has had through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy tables, tablecloths, soft drinks and other drinks, as well as seats and candies.

All of them go to school. She has been farming for five years. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy more fertilizers for her Irish potatoes crops. The profits from the business will be used to improve her welfare.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

This comes from her mother who is an expert seamstress. <br \/><br \/>So when she got married she decided to generate income by doing what she likes. She started to study fashion design and learned the technical part of dressmaking, perfecting her art so she could start her adventure into business. <br \/><br \/>Today her sales are in cash and she works from Monday to Friday from 8 in the morning until 6 pm or even until 10 pm. All this with the goal of being very productive and generate ever more revenue. Right now her goal is to support her daughter's education. She is studying at university and this requires a lot of money. Her main challenge is to have enough resources to expand her productivity and bring about her dreams of prosperity. <br \/><br \/>She is applying for a loan from Kiva which is the first loan she has had through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.
