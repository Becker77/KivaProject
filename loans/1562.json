He is married and has three children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past six years, Charles has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells essential goods like sugar, salt and water. \n\nTo help expand his business, Charles has requested a loan of UGX 2,000,000 from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more items to sell, such as sugar, rice and all types of flour and will help Charles to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children. Charles hopes that in the future he will be able to expand the shop into a wholesale shop. \n\nCharles is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Charles who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1704979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase for more items to sell, like sugar, rice and all types of flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bombo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.666667 31.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2014-10-08T17:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-07T17:30:08Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":141027},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146121},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":151398},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":156866},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162531},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168401},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":174483},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":180784},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":187313},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":194078},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":776499,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La venta de recarga a celulares, dirigida a negocios es hoy la actividad generadora de ingresos de Elizabeth  y de su esposo, quien trabaja como coordinador de una empresa que comercializa este tipo de productos.

This was possible because of Kiva's support. A painting machine and enough stock of wood are the greatest challenges facing his enterprise. \n\nRashidi starts his business at 7;30 am and works till 8:00 pm daily and is able to make a good profit each month.\n\nFrom Tujijenge Tanzania, this is his second loan request to be apportioned among Tuda's two group members. The group members will hold each other accountable to repay the loan. Rashidi will use his credit request to replenish his business with wood for making furniture. \n\nRashid used the previous loan to buy a color spray machine which he uses now to color his furniture to make it look attractive. He is so happy because he is now able to receive more orders than before. He managed to earn extra income which he used to cover school fees and household expenses.

She is married to Ramon, a businessman, and is the mother to her children. She manages their household, together with her husband and children, while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSusan operates a food processing business. She makes homemade pastries and she specializes in pizza. She earns an income by selling her products to her neighbors and to suppliers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy raw ingredients and materials needed to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams of having a transportation service like a tricycle, which she could also use for business purposes and to help with their everyday expenses. She hopes that her house will also be renovated someday. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is married to Richard, a tricycle driver, and is the mother to their three children. Their first child is still in the preparatory school and the other two are not of school age yet. She and her husband work hard to meet their everyday needs and to support their child\u2019s schooling. \r\n\r\nBambi operates a tricycle unit, which her husband drives. The tricycle carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Palawan, tricycles are a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, to church, to their friends' homes and to other destinations within their community. They even ride from one town to another. Bambi earns a minimum of 700 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nBambi, like many other Filipinas, is a very industrious woman, so she is opening a general store. For additional working capital she is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as rice, charcoal, cooking oil, and canned goods. She is confident that her store will have a good return since it will have all the essential food items that any household needs every day. She thanks God and you in advance and is grateful for the financial help that will be given to her. This will definitely help meet her family's daily expenses and send her children to school. \r\n\r\nBambi dreams of being successful in her two businesses so she can give her children the best education possible and a better future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1706067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Their blue and yellow house has no reliable access to electricity and thus Junette is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. She wishes her kids had better light for studying at night. A solar-powered microgrid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Junette and her family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower-cost energy source. She is looking forward to being connected as it will allow her to save money. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to cover the upfront cost of connection to the grid, which she will repay through her payments for electricity.\r\n\r\nAn electrical connection dramatically reduces the cost of lighting in towns such as Les Anglais while offering far superior light quality and more generally providing opportunities for people to dramatically improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click here<\/a>."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1706223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to connect to Haiti's first solar hybrid smart electricity grid.

She is a member of Shalom Self Help Group. She is 63 years old and a mother of five.  \n\nShe does mixed farming that includes growing maize and beans and poultry and dairy farming.

She is a 23-year-old resident of Intramuros, Manila, Philippines. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLucelle is a soft-drinks dealer. She buys large quantities of soft drinks from a soft-drinks factory and then sells them to different variety stores. Her ability to please people gives her an increasing number of loyal customers. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 17,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more stock of soft drinks varieties to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLucelle hopes to become a successful businesswoman someday.

He has been farming for 18 years. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy more fertilizers. The profits from the business will be used to renovate his house.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

She is 50 years old and has children. Her husband is Roberto and she manages a buy-and-sell business. Her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenses.\r\n\r\nWhat she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and then sells it piecemeal at a little profit. Products can range from ready-to-wear clothing and eye wear to beads, bracelets and other similar products. She also sells rice, which she buys by the sack, and other goods. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nEmma is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan to purchase more products and merchandise to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales. The additional revenue will help improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Emma hopes to grow and expand her business. She dreams of a happy and better living for her family and she also desires that her youngest child finish schooling. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also has a tricycle unit for transport service which her husband drives for added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her general store business, Nena is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as, sacks of rice, charcoal and soda. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings meet her family's daily expenses and  send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nNena hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they could have a better life. She strives to hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is a farmer in Kiambu Kenya where he has been practicing farming for the last three years. He also undertakes small scale coffee and banana farming. He currently has only one dairy cow producing a meager 6 litres of milk per day. His farm activities contribute only 60% of the required family income and he works as a driver to supplement this income.\n\nEdward is confident that the farm activities are able to provide adequate income and is planning to resign from the driving job to concentrate on the farm activities. With a loan from Kiva, he plans to buy a dairy cow that can produce 15 litres of milk per day. A milk production of 23 litres per day will help Edward raise enough money to take good care of his

She has managed to fully repay loans of KES 10,000, 20,000 and 40,000 which she received from the micro-finance institution ECLOF. \n\nLilian has plans of expanding her business into wholesale. Her life has changed tremendously in that she is able to educate her children and pay school fees for her brother. She takes care of her aging mother. With support from Kiva, she will grow to a supplier of onions in the nearby markets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1709041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Only their youngest son still lives with them. She has a specialist high school education and is a product distribution manager. She also has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture for many years as an additional source of income for her family. Her farm now brings in about 10,000 KGS per month thanks to her two dairy cows, two steers and 20 sheep, as well as 2.4 hectares of land where she grows beans and hay.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Myrsagyz has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase 20 sheep.

She is 19 years old and supported by her parents. She grew up together with her brother and sister in a happy family. \r\n\r\n\u201cMy parents work hard to fulfill my dreams even though we are financially not good,\u201d she said. The financial condition of her family is not reliable, with both parents earning meager income that can hardly manage the household expenses. \u201cSeeing them, I always told myself that I\u2019m going to make them happy someday when I grow up,\u201d she said. Her parents are the main source of inspiration for her to aspire to achieve her dreams. \u201cI had always wanted to dedicate my life for the cause of humanity.\u201d \r\n\r\nThere was a bizarre period of time when she was in depression because she was not able to pursue her childhood dream of becoming a doctor. She was obsessed over it. Her academic performance was not good, so she could not make it in the medical selection test conducted by the state. Thousands of candidates compete for a few limited seats in this selection test, and it is very difficult to make it through this test. Her parents were anxious at that time because there was nothing that could be done to console her or send her for coaching classes, due to their weak financial condition. Other students go for private medical coaching for four to five years, especially to appear for this selection test, and yet they cannot make it through.\r\n\r\nConsidering this, she made up her mind eventually and started going to college. Her parents were happy for her, since she was getting over her depression, but at the same time, she was unhappy because she had to give up her childhood dream. She has a big heart, and is able to console herself that \u201cthis is life, and the unexpected is to be faced and accepted by us.\u201d When life closes one door, the other opens. \r\n\r\nLikewise, she feels relieved and thrilled that she was selected for cabin crew this time. She considers this opportunity as a second chance given by God to do something more in life and dedicate her life for the cause of humanity. She wants to serve people while flying high. \r\n\r\nHowever, the thought of paying a large sum for a security deposit, which is mandatory for selected candidates to undergo training, still disturbs her mind, and she feels helpless. She heard of Kiva education loans from her friends. This delighted her mind that her dreams are going to be finally fulfilled. The Kiva loan she obtained has unburdened her parents\u2019 financial instability, as well as hers. She will pay the refundable deposit with the Kiva loan and start to join the training. \r\n\r\nShe says the financial help given to her is priceless, and she is very much grateful to the lenders for their generosity. She ensures that she will extend help to her parents once she starts earning and also provide for her siblings with good education for achieving their goals. \r\n\r\nShe said, \u201cThank you Kiva and WSDS for the change you brought in my life.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1701311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay the security deposit for cabin crew training.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-10-08T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-07T20:00:05Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chaoba Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-09T04:26:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":779786,"name":"Armando Rogelio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armando lives with his family in San Martin, Puebla.

They never had the money to install a proper roof and the walls were not built correctly so now they are starting to fall. Armando has an informal job and makes around $800 USD a month. This makes it impossible to get a credit from other institutions. Armando knows that he needs to install a proper roof and repair the walls as soon as possible before more damage is done. This is why he is asking for a credit, to get the money he needs to buy all the materials and do all the work at once.

Vicenta works sewing clothes at home, basically attaching badges to uniforms. Vicenta works hard to be able to give her kids a better life and more opportunities. Part of a better life for her is a proper home. She and her husband worked hard to build a home, however she knows that the dirt floor in the home is a health hazard and being able to change that will considerably improve their life. Since Vicenta has an informal job and makes around $ 700 USD a month, access to credit with other institutions is very difficult. Vicenta is asking for a credit so she can finish buying the materials needed to install a proper ceramic floor and get rid of the dirt. Her husband will do the construction work and the family will receive visits from a certified technician that will make sure the work was done properly.

She started pursuing her passion few years ago. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Tekatuli, a remote village in the Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal. She is a proud mother of two school-going sons, who are in grade 9 and grade 12. Her husband Giren is a small farmer.  His income is quite unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nFor the past few years, she has been making a small living through practicing dairy farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk to the nearby market. She passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business.  \r\n\r\nBJS (Kiva's partner), is an organization that supports enterprising women in doing business to financially help their families. So Joyda is seeking a loan from BJS to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing more milk per day. That means she will be able to reach to more customers and add more income to the family fund. From this loan, the life of Joyda will permanently change and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children.\r\n\r\nShe conveys her thanks to her lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1697972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a cow for dairy business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-08T21:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-07T21:00:11Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-09T01:12:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":778951,"name":"Cirila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cirila is a married woman with five children.

She is one of three members of the group \"Mayram\".  Gulzada has a university education and works as a schoolteacher for some of the earlier grades.  She also raises livestock, grows crops and sells milk to earn some extra money on the side, and has done so since 1998.  Thanks to her persistence, she currently has two cows, ten sheep, and 0.50 hectares of land for growing clover, while her monthly income is nearly 15,000 som.  To further develop her farm, she is seeking a loan of 50,000 som from Bai-Tushum and Partners to buy some calves.  She plans on using any additional money she earns due to the loan to further expand her farm, and will also set some of it aside to buy a plot of land for a family house.

She is the featured borrower of the group. She weaves different patterns of traditional wraparounds and shawls as a means of sustenance for her livelihood, while her husband is a daily wage earner in construction work. His work is unreliable because he works on a temporary basis only when there is a requirement. The eldest son works in a private company to support himself, while the other three children go to school in their hometown. \r\n\r\nSiemte\u2019s household income is scarce, and they can hardly manage to provide for the family requirements and school fees. As they could not manage the family\u2019s expenditures with their meagre income, Siemte initiated weaving for longer hours and extended her weaving hours until late evenings so that she could weave more products and generate more income. For the improvement of her business and her children\u2019s study, Siemte wants to avail herself of a loan amounting to 12,173 INR for a 45-watt solar light. \r\n\r\nSiemte says she is inspired by those villages where solar lights are installed and that experience an increase in their economic activity levels. Installing solar lights in villages allows businesses to operate during the evening and nighttime. Therefore, she believes that solar electricity will help to promote her enterprise, as she can use the system to provide lighting to operate during the evening and night. At the same time, the children can study in a brighter room with better concentration on their lessons. She says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva, for the loan.\u201d \r\n\r\nLike her, the rest of the group members also need solar home lighting for their respective income-generating activities and household use. Their main activities are weaving, variety shop, etc.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1700452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a 45-watt mini solar home lighting system that will light up four light bulbs up to twelve hours a day and help her to weave for longer hours.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lungawikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tawnluoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalhlupui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siemte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lallawmkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60865,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":60865}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-09T08:32:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":776539,"name":"Oscar Alfonso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar de 36 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus dos hijos, el cliente trabaja de alba\u00f1il en distintos proyectos y trabajos por obra, tiene ya 10 a\u00f1os de experiencia como alba\u00f1il, con los trabajos que \u00e9l hace lleva el sustento a su hogar, Oscar quiere colocar piso y puertas a los cuartos de su vivienda pero no le alcanza para poder hacerlo, por esa raz\u00f3n solicita  un cr\u00e9dito para comprar  cer\u00e1mica, laminas, cemento, balcones, etc. ah\u00ed donde muestra la fotograf\u00eda para poder vivir mas c\u00f3modos.","en":"Oscar is 36 years old.

Sus ventas las realiza de contado y a cr\u00e9dito todos los d\u00edas, de 7 de la ma\u00f1ana a 10 de la noche, comprando de contado en almacenes especializados en las mercanc\u00edas que vende a los clientes del barrio y de sus alrededores.

","en":"Selling movies, records, compact DVDs, and merchandise are the businesses with which Ana generates income.  She is 37 years old and lives with her two children in a municipality very close to the city of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nAna started her business five years ago.  She had experience in this business activity by working with other people.  However, it was only when her son proposed that he accompany her on her trips to earn money that she thought about undertaking her son's own business by purchasing DVD players and movies to sell.\r\n\r\nShe later bought two computers and started offering transcription services and jobs on the internet.  She took advantage of having a school very close to her house to make the most of her sales.\r\n\r\nShe has gradually been turning her business towards the sale of movies.  She travels to other cities in Colombia where she brings clothes, shoes, and toiletries.  She sells for cash and for credit every day from seven in the morning until ten at night.

She purchases a steer for about 150,000 francs, pays for veterinary care, and buys feed with the 50,000 francs. She plans on reselling it between 325,000 and 350,000 francs. The remaining 50,000 francs will be invested in commerce. She is purchasing three 20-liter containers of oil at 13,500 francs each, and four 50-piece cases of bar soap at 5,000 francs per case.

At home, she is a lovely mother of one dependent child and two married children. She is the owner of a small rice field. By operating farming business, she can earn around $5.00 USD a day to support her family's daily expands. So far, she has been involved in this career for thirty-four years.\r\n\r\nTo keep her rice growing well with more crops, Sok is going to use natural fertilizers on her farmland.

It is composed of members living in and around the same village. The members get along well and have solidarity. Their main work involves commerce and the fattening of livestock. \r\n\r\nYacine, standing at the right in the photo with a hand raised, is 42 years old. She is a married mother of eight children, including four girls. Her business involves fattening sheep. She has been in this business for a long time, has good experience in this domain, and is managing incredibly well. \r\n\r\nShe is purchasing 3 ewes with their lambs between 35,000 and 40,000 francs. She is also purchasing some feed and paying the veterinary fees with the rest of the money.

Richard practices mixed farming, growing bananas, tea and a variety of food crops. Of all the activities in which he is involved, poultry farming is closest to his heart. Waking up every morning to collect eggs makes him very proud. Feeding his poultry is his hobby. \r\n\r\nRichard has always wanted to increase his poultry farming operation because the demand is overwhelming, but the biggest challenge has been lack of capital. Richard has traits of a mobilizer, and he decided to mobilize other small scale farmers who share this common problem. Together, they joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that uses a co-guarantee mechanism to provide agricultural-based loans. Richard is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. With the loan, he will be able to buy more poultry and satisfy the overwhelming demand. Through the loan he will significantly increase his sales and this will translate to more profits. \r\n\r\nDemand for chicken is high in Nyamira; it is a popular meal for many people, and fast food joints are always full. Increased profits will allow Richard to improve his living conditions and get out of the poverty-stricken situation he is currently in. Other than profits, he will also benefit from poultry manure, which has higher nitrogen than other livestock manure. Through the loan, Richard sees a brighter future. He awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1707584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3184.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3277.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3373.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3472.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3573.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3678.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3785.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3896.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4010.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4127.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4247.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4372.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.97,"local_amount":7540.55,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7842.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625218},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":3478.23,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3617.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194368},{"amount":82.83,"local_amount":7100.14,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7384.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262200},{"amount":89.19,"local_amount":7645.16,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7951.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600491},{"amount":89.87,"local_amount":7982.05,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8302,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.25,"payment_id":681377350},{"amount":90.98,"local_amount":8379.28,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8715.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.78,"payment_id":711505366},{"amount":32.09,"local_amount":2874.59,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2989.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":752110507}],"funded_date":"2014-11-07T01:40:16Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":779049,"name":"Joy Hope Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2014, Joy Hope Women Group joined Hand in Hand Eastern Africa in order to be trained on financial management, enterprise development, and savings mobilization to help sharpen their business skills.

Meet Emmanuel, aged 30, who lives in Kurgong, a remote village in the Eldoret area of Kenya. Kurgong area is an area where hard core poverty pervades every home, yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about 5,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. They are like the bones in the \u201cvalley of dry bones\u201d that required only a breath to spring back to life. Armed with this conviction, Emmanuel has been toiling in his farm for the past 4 years. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that he engages in to the make ends meet. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. Emmanuel passionately loves dairy farming and as he likes to put it \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart\u201d. He plans not to buy just an ordinary cow but to buy a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and also towards the education of his children. He will also benefit the from cow manure which will be used in increasing the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan he will also be able to build a bio-gas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. This loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions. Emmanuel waits for your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1707589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

lenders! Meet Cornelius, a passionate and hardworking go-getter. He is based in Lessos, a remote village in Nandi hills, Kenya. This area is faced with hardcore poverty and very bad terrain. For the past three years, he has actively been involved in mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk and eggs. Cornelius passionately loves farming, but the biggest challenge he faces is transportation of the products to the market and timely delivery. The Nandi hills area has poor roads and the terrain makes it even worse. He faces challenges transporting his produce, especially during the rainy seasons.\r\n\r\nCornelius is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Because of poor feeder roads and bad terrain, this loan will assist him a great deal. Through the loan, he will be able to transport his produce from the farm and deliver it to the market on-time. Milk is very perishable and requires quick delivery to the market and through the loan, he will be able to make quick deliveries and never suffer losses. Eggs are very fragile and they require proper handling and through the motorbike, he will be able to transport his eggs using crates to the market.\r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, an institution that supports small holder farmers, Cornelius is assured that his dreams will come to pass. Cornelius has gone through financial and technical training with Juhudi Kilimo and is confident that through savings from the loan, he will improve his living conditions and repay back the loan. Cornelius plans to impact the society positively through employing someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping him in the field. This loan will be a stepping stone for the success of Cornelius.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1707602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cornelius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":779064,"name":"Edison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edison is a repeat client at the institution.

who are all grown-up and living on their own.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and has worked as a farmer for many years.  She started with a single cow, and now has two cows and two sheep, as well as 0.50 hectares of rented land and 0.70 of her own for growing barley.  The money she earns allows her to raise livestock and prepare stores of fodder for the winter.  To further develop her farm, she is seeking a loan of 30,000 som from Bai-Tushum & Partners to buy a heifer.  She plans on reinvesting any extra income due to the loan back into her farm, and hopes to build a new barn for her animals in particular.\r\n\r\n

Meet Mathew, 26 years of age, very young, hardworking and energetic. He hails from the Nandi hills area of Kenya, an area that is blessed with good climatic conditions and weather patterns that favor farming. Mathew is blessed with one adorable child and has been doing farming for the past three years. \r\n\r\nMathew was raised in a humble family, and he never got the opportunity to go to college because of lack of tuition fees. As a result of this, he never got any formal employment and didn\u2019t settle down to that. He started farming, and through farming he has been able to take care of his family and also take care of his parents. Mathew's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg-selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. \r\n\r\nThe Nandi hills area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Mathew is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Mathew is very determined to succeed and because he is much disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents.\r\n\r\nMathew's dream is to go back to school and he hopes that through your loan, you will help him realize his dream.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1707605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Elzat has a college degree and works in a secondary school teaching Kyrgyz language. Also, since 1993 she has been engaged in farming. She had only 10,000 as her starting capital. At present Elzat\u2019s farm includes two cows, two calves, one bull, and 10 sheep. Also Elzat has a 2.0 ha [5 acres] land plot, where she grows beans and apples for own consumption and sale. Elzat makes an effort to use her savings to  invest in business development. However, this year she decided to renovate her house.

The loan will be used to buy more clothes and shoes for sale. It will help Chance to generate greater profits, improve her business and also be able to take care of her child. \r\n\r\nChance hopes that in the future she will be able to own a much bigger boutique. \r\n\r\nChance is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

However, lack of funds is her biggest challenge.\r\n \r\nCecilia is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter. She has plans of expanding her dairy farm by growing her milk production volume. A chaff cutter is going to help her achieve the objective by shredding fodder into little evenly cut pieces that the stock can quickly and easily ingest and digest.

also called agriculture or husbandry, is the cultivation of animals and plants for food and other products used to sustain life. Agriculture continues to dominate Kenya\u2019s economy, and is the largest contributor to Kenya\u2019s gross domestic product. Robinson, 42, started farming approximately 11 years ago, and although he began farming as a hobby, it eventually became his career. His half-acre of land, located in the Thika area of Kenya, houses poultry and dairy cows.<br \/><br \/>Robinson passionately loves dairy farming. The Thika area is populated, and has a ready market for dairy products. However, Robinson's biggest challenge is feeding his cows, which is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used in cutting hay into smaller pieces, before it is mixed with other kinds of forage. This helps the animal's digestion and prevents the animal from rejecting any part of the food. Through this loan, Robinson will double his milk production.<br \/><br \/>Robinson has been facing challenges accessing financing, but he feels relieved, knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva are there, to make his dream come true. Robinson chose Juhudi Kilimo, because the interest rate on their loans is low, and is on a reducing basis. Robinson underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through the loan, Robinson's income will increase and his life will permanently change, leading to better living conditions for his family and a positive impact to the community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":646.63,"image":{"id":1707702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robinson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":227.39,"local_amount":19707.42,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":20294.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823678},{"amount":419.24,"local_amount":36334.23,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":37417.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665458997}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T23:43:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":776059,"name":"Panambi Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"18 son las mujeres que integran este grupo, est\u00e1n en su primer ciclo, son mujeres jefas de familia que luchan por poder salir adelante, quieren dar a sus familias todo lo que ellas no pudieron tener.\nBeatriz es una de las integrantes de este grupo, ella es la presidenta del grupo, es una mujer muy trabajadora y emprendedora, que est\u00e1 luchando por poder crecer y salir adelante.

Meet John. He is a 39-year-old farmer from Chebiemit village, situated in Kapsowar area of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and four children, on a small piece of land where he keeps poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. For five years, his primary sources of income have been eggs and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases.<br \/><br \/>John made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo, in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime last month, he applied for a loan for expanding his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations, to increase the overall output.<br \/><br \/>The additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out and start working, to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, John\u2019s children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":223.77,"image":{"id":1707711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.96,"local_amount":3285.53,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3298.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194380},{"amount":34.41,"local_amount":3058.44,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3070.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262211},{"amount":36.02,"local_amount":3201.61,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3214.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600504},{"amount":37.58,"local_amount":3456.55,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3470.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":681377360},{"amount":72.19,"local_amount":6887.96,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6915.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.3,"payment_id":711505378}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T05:40:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":776572,"name":"Carlos Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta 6\u00ba grado en la escuela de la comunidad donde \u00e9l vive desde que naci\u00f3, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado y su pareja se dedica a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos y tienen una hija reci\u00e9n nacida.    \n\nCarlos trabaja de ayudante de alba\u00f1il desde hace 5 a\u00f1os y viaja en bus a distintos municipios, antes de tomar el bus camina 20 minutos y para ello se levanta a las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana, su pareja se levanta a las 3 de la ma\u00f1ana para preparar el desayuno, adem\u00e1s Carlos cultiva ma\u00edz y frijol para el consumo del hogar.\n\n\u00c9l necesita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar 4 sacos de abono para aplicar al cultivo de ma\u00edz, y para pagar un dinero que le prestaron para el parto de su esposa.\n\n\u00c9l tiene muchos deseos de seguir trabajando para darle a su beb\u00e9 reci\u00e9n nacida todo lo que sea necesario porque es una gran bendici\u00f3n que dios le ha dado.   \n","en":"Carlos is 26 years old and has a grade 6 education from the school in the community where he has lived since he was born.

Raikan is raising animals and growing farm produce, having launched this business in 1989. Thanks to Raikan\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes three cows, one calf, two bulls and 20 sheep. Also, on her land plot of 1.62 ha [4 acres] she grows clover in order to have animal feed in winter.

Also as the majority of people are Protestants they don' t celebrate their Saint's Day festivals. <br \/><br \/>The group is made up of Catalina and Marciano who are husband and wife and parents to 5 children. Three of the children are also members of the group: Carlos, Marcial and \u00d3scar as they are now fathers of families. Catalina's other two children still are dependent on her although only the youngest still studies. <br \/><br \/>\u00d3scar says that given the economic problems of the family, years ago he and his two brothers emigrated to the United States to work and help their parents. With the money they sent to Mexico Marciano saved and bought a taxi and worked offering it's services. \u00d3scar comments that their  experience abroad wasn't what the brothers expected so they returned to their community to work as drivers for other people. Although there was not much profit, with his income and the money that he saved in his time in the neighboring country he could buy used cars to stop being employees and have their own taxi business. <br \/><br \/>\u00d3scar is very cheerful and jokes commenting \u201c we have our taxis extremely financed but now we don't have to work for somebody and so we need the loan to finish paying for them\u201d. \u00d3scar explains that on Mondays a bus travels the same route taking away all their passengers and that the pavement on the road is in bad shape so they have to take the cars to the mechanic more often. However he his father and brothers work very happily every day to achieve their goal of having more taxis and provide employment for other drivers.<br \/><br \/>With a smile Catalina comments that \u201c Vision Fund has changed our lives\u201d. The family still hasn't finished paying for some of their automobiles but the loan allows them to move along with their payments. \u201c My husband was able to purchase a 2015 vehicle as a taxi with one of the loans\u201d Catalina happily comments who unlike her husband and sons raises animals like chickens, cows, lambs and turkeys. With the profits from this activity she has started to buy some groceries and open a small store. <br \/><br \/>They used the last two loans to buy a mill which they rent out to people in the community and expand the store. This time they will invest the loan in more grocery products. The family is very grateful to VisionFund M\u00e9xico as thanks to the loans they have obtained in the past two years they have been able to get ahead. They say that they worked with another micro-finance company but on a trip into the municipality they saw some advertisements, requested information and they were enchanted with the idea of forming a family group and with the lower rates of

Meet Grace, 39 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Chebiamit, a remote village in Kapsowar. She is happily married and is blessed with four adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Kapsowar area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1707613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.73,"local_amount":3531.9,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625224},{"amount":20.24,"local_amount":1798.93,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1806.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194373},{"amount":40.86,"local_amount":3632.05,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3646.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262204},{"amount":42.36,"local_amount":3765.13,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3780.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600496},{"amount":78.51,"local_amount":7271.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":7301.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.3,"payment_id":696587105}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T19:51:32Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":776577,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn and firewood in bulk;

Valentina worked for many years in a hospital as a midwife, and now she is retired. <br \/><br \/>As an additional source of income, since 1993 she has been involved in the cultivation and sale of indoor plants and wildflowers. She sells them in different establishments. Currently, Valentina's activities bring in a monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS). These funds are sorely insufficient for a decent life and raising two sons who have had health problems since birth. For the further development of her business, Valentina applied to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS), which she will  direct to the purchase of pots and seeds of new types of flowers for sale. <br \/><br \/>She wants to spend income from the loan on the installation of bathrooms in the home.

Today, he keeps poultry and dairy cattle and grows various crops. \r\nNicholas stated, \"I find dairy and horticultural farming to be very enjoyable! My biggest challenge is capital to expand.\" He is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow. The breed he is going for is more productive than the predominant traditional breeds.

Meet Priscilla, 34 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Karunge, a remote village in Thika. She is happily married and is blessed with five adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 10 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in other small personal business. The Thika area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1707736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":3428.73,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3570.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625231},{"amount":26.54,"local_amount":2275.23,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2369.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194384},{"amount":25.34,"local_amount":2171.6,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2261.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823682},{"amount":28.46,"local_amount":2439.63,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2540.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262214},{"amount":27.84,"local_amount":2386.36,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2484.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264304},{"amount":28.51,"local_amount":2443.89,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2544.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600508},{"amount":30.44,"local_amount":2609.29,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2716.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459001},{"amount":30.18,"local_amount":2677.92,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2788.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.06,"payment_id":681377364},{"amount":29.83,"local_amount":2664.47,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2774.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.26,"payment_id":696587111},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":6902.88,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7187.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.5,"payment_id":711505382}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T07:10:32Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":779149,"name":"Harriet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harriet is married with five children and four of them go to school.

Meet Risper, a 20-year-old youthful mum. She is a very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of one child. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Kapsowar, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nRisper passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past two years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding her family requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her parents and family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nRisper has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and the price of milk has been going up recently, so Risper, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, which will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nRisper said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Risper hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your

Meet Anthony, a 30-year-old self-driven man, and a very hardworking and dedicated farmer. He is based in Kiambaa village, a remote area in Thika, which is a semi-arid area. The living conditions in the Thika area are very tough, being a semi-arid area, and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Anthony has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. He is happily married and has been blessed with two children. \r\n\r\nHe is a mixed farmer and has been practicing farming for the past 12 years. He has never looked back and does not regret it. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business he engages in to make ends meet. He stated that the most enjoyable part about farming is selling produce in the market. He faces the challenge of lack of feed for his dairy cattle.\r\n\r\nHe is kindly seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device used to cut hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forages. This helps the animal digest the hay and prevents the cow from rejecting any part of the food. Through this loan the cow will double its milk production. Anthony projects the cow will be producing between 15 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will automatically increase his income and allow him to improve his living conditions. Because of this high milk production potential, he will save more money to fully repay the loan. He believes that through careful selection and the application of the strict standard of excellence in keeping his dairy cow, he will have more income, which will improve his living standards.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":191.91,"image":{"id":1707766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff cutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.9,"local_amount":4079.62,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4096.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823686},{"amount":17.27,"local_amount":1534.73,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264308},{"amount":17.93,"local_amount":1593.59,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1600.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600514},{"amount":17.87,"local_amount":1588.77,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1595.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459005},{"amount":46.79,"local_amount":4305.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4322.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"payment_id":681377368},{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":3956.74,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3972.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.18,"payment_id":731022237}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T06:46:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":772395,"name":"Bagosphere","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"BagoSphere is a vocational training company that enables rural youth to gain quick access to gainful employment. BagoSphere provides a unique combination of communication, critical thinking, and life skills training, in just two months, to rural youth. With those skills, rural youth become skilled communicators, and they become highly desired by the call center industry in the Philippines.<br \/><br \/>With a success rate of 80 percent, BagoSphere\u2019s program enables rural youth to experience a seamless transition from training to working in a multi-national company.<br \/><br \/>Rural youth form a large base of untapped talent in the Philippines. BagoSphere aims to unlock their talents, to boost the manpower supply for call centers and business process outsourcing (BPO) companies in Bacolod City, thereby fueling the growth of the industry. In turn, the call center jobs provide youth with incomes that are four times higher than unskilled work, enabling them to save toward pursuing their professional and personal development goals.<br \/><br \/>BagoSphere is the recipient of Singapore International Foundation\u2019s Young Social Entrepreneurs Grant Program and an award winner of Start-up@Singapore\u2019s Social Enterprise competition in 2012. BagoSphere was incubated by Social Venture Lab at the National University of Singapore (NUS). BagoSphere is also supported by Kickstart Ventures (a subsidiary of Globe Telecom), Co.Lab Xchange Incubator, the Small World Group Incubator (SWGI), Impact Investment Exchange (Asia), and the Bago City local government. In addition, it is a member of Innov8 Sparks, the network of technology startup support and funding initiatives founded by members of the SingTel Group.<br \/><br \/>BagoSphere seeks expansion capital. Being a pioneer in training out-of-school youth for business process outsourcing firms (BPOs) in rural Philippines, BagoSphere has developed a core set of tools, and experience in getting youth into call center jobs. Piloted in Negros Occidental by BagoSphere since 2011, BagoSphere's program has been able to consistently train out-of-school youth in two months to become call center agents, hired by top call centers in Bacolod City. BagoSphere\u2019s partner employers include Teleperformance, Transcom, Teletech, Convergys and Panasiatic Solutions. BagoSphere has trained 103 out-of-school youth to date, and 85% of them found call center jobs within two months of graduation. Dedicated to the social cause of empowering youth with full-time employment, BagoSphere\u2019s engagement with its students lasts beyond the training period. As a result, the long-term (over six months after graduation) employment rate is sustained at over 60%.<br \/><br \/>BagoSphere\u2019s curriculum was developed with out-of-school youth employment in mind. This involves English communications, IT, financial literacy, and life skills. Already in its seventh iteration, BagoSphere\u2019s curriculum features confidence building and value formation (e.g., professional work ethics, cultivating focus and discipline), integrated into everyday lessons. On the execution end, BagoSphere employs former call center trainers to deliver high-quality training. With a blended revenue model of tuition fees and placement fees, BagoSphere has been able to execute a model that is financially sustainable and helps BPOs save on recruitment costs. Out-of-school youth take a micro-finance loan from NWTF or from BagoSphere, in a \"study-now-pay-later\u201d scheme to finance their studies, while BPOs pay BagoSphere a placement fee for every hire.<br \/><br \/>Having worked with NWTF in 2013, BagoSphere believes that the two organizations' interests are closely aligned. NWTF\u2019s special education loan enables BagoSphere to reduce its operational risk in debt collection, which is not the core strength of BagoSphere. At the same time, NWTF can leverage BagoSphere\u2019s expertise in training youth, to decrease the risk of their educational loans.<br \/><br \/>The photo features BagoSphere's CEO, Zhihan, as well as other BagoSphere staff and students.

Meet Yunuke, a 54-year-old youthful shosho (old mum). She is a very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of three children. She lives with her husband in the rich highlands of the Kisii area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nYunuke passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past eight years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets, but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nYunuke has identified a free space in her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and milk prices have been going up recently, so Yunuke, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow, but also manure which will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nYunuke said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans, and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. \r\n\r\nYunuke hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to add value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her three school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1707741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-09T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-08T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.7,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yunuke","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2208.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2272.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2339.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2407.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2550.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2624.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2701.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2780.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2861.63},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3031.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.55,"local_amount":1832.27,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1834.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625232},{"amount":44.06,"local_amount":3927.56,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3932.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194385},{"amount":27.84,"local_amount":2481.72,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2484.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823683},{"amount":26.72,"local_amount":2381.95,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2384.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262215},{"amount":10.31,"local_amount":918.92,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":920.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264305},{"amount":143.56,"local_amount":12796.97,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":12812.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600509},{"amount":64.66,"local_amount":6060.13,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6067.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.32,"payment_id":731022235},{"amount":8.6,"local_amount":800.48,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":801.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.38,"payment_id":752110514}],"funded_date":"2014-10-09T23:47:01Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":779176,"name":"Alaisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaisha lives in Kampala, Uganda.

He has many dreams he wants to achieve, and is considered a young, tenacious, brave, and committed. He is not afraid of challenges, but rather is passionate about overcoming them. He is totally driven by his goals; he is a young dreamer who sets deadlines and works hard for what he wants. His initial motivation to continue his education is to improve himself and to expand his knowledge in the academic field, and to be able to acquire economic, personal, and professional benefits through education. \r\n\r\nNorman believes that most effective way to help contribute to his family is through education, as this will set an example for his siblings so that they can set goals and be motivated to follow in his footsteps as an excellent student and professional. He also thinks that education will eventually pay off for his family economically. \r\n\r\nNorman says: \u201cI have great faith that the country\u2019s socio-economic situation can improve through many small, combined efforts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt one point in his life he considered the opportunity to both work and study in a foreign country, but this made him feel a little cowardly, since he has to fight for what he really wanted. So those opportunities to go to another country are in the past, but he is confident that his country will give him opportunities to achieve professional growth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that individual fulfillment is reached when a person is comfortable with themselves, being true to what they believe and seek. Economic rewards are a result of being true to yourself: they come when people live honestly and sincerely.  In the near future I have plans to create my own business. In the meantime, I am gaining experience, knowledge, and learning from successful people.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1701825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Their ultimate goal is to create a more prosperous future for themselves and their families. The average age of the ladies is 41 years, and they each average six children. The women have various small businesses including animal husbandry, production and sale of textiles, fruit and vegetable sales and a bakery.\r\n\r\nJosefa, a 60-year-old member of the Trust Bank, is the mother of 11 children. Her family works with her in her bakery business. All are very happy to be able to access working capital through Friendship Bridge. Because of the increased demand  for the bakery's products, Josefa is requesting a loan to purchase butter, sugar, flour, firewood and other necessary supplies. Josefa sells her delicious baked goods in at least three nearby markets as she doesn\u2019t have her own locale. \r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank understand the importance of education, not only for themselves but for their children as well. Most of the women have had little or no education at all. Josefa could not afford to send all of her children to school, but is pleased that at least the three youngest children are enrolled in school this year. \r\n\r\nJosefa and her fellow Trust Bank members benefit from the educational training given by a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer at their monthly meetings. The loans and educational segments of the meetings are what Friendship Bridge has labeled \u201cMicrocredit Plus,\u201d and it is a combination that yields great benefits. Some of the topics discussed include women\u2019s health, hygiene and identity, empowerment, self-esteem and leadership as well as effective business management tools. The women are able to develop new personal and financial skills.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cUnion Maya\u201d Trust Bank wants to acknowledge the support of KIVA investors from throughout the world. These loans are a really big step for the ladies, and with the working capital they will be able to maintain or increase their small businesses. In this way, they will generate more income; their families will realize benefits and they will be closer to their goal of eliminating poverty in their lives! Thank you, KIVA investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5275,"image":{"id":1706411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

My favorite themes to work on are characters in religious mythology, because they offer a variety of ways for an artist to express creativity and style.

in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. It is quite popular with tourists who have come here for many decades.  Eight women have recently joined together and formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres Franciscana\u201d. The ladies have various commercial businesses including catalogue sales (cosmetics and cleaning products), hand-woven textiles as well as the manufacture and sale of crafts and folk art. \r\n\r\nBirma is a 42-year-old member of the group and has four children. Three of the children are in school which makes Birma quite happy as she lacked one year to complete high school. She wants all of her children to complete their college education. Her husband is a painter and the couple works hard to take care of the family. Birma has a craft business and sells ornaments and decorations for quincea\u00f1eras, baptisms, graduation ornaments, and weddings. She needs a loan to buy more raw materials including paper, silicone guns, ribbons, threads, among other necessary materials to keep the business moving. Birma is usually quite busy but at this time of year. Her workload increases because school graduations are approaching and there are many celebrations.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Trust Bank, many of whom were unable to complete their schooling, are happy to participate in the educational part of their monthly meetings. The \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and education, gives the ladies some useful personal and business tools that they can put to use immediately. Subjects covered include violence against women, women\u2019s rights, health, nutrition and hygiene as well as the use of medicinal plants. The women learn how to successfully manage their small loans with information about business planning, budgeting, marketing and customer service.\r\n\r\nBirma and her friends in the Trust Bank are grateful for the opportunity to have a loan because they have a real desire to excel. Without a helping hand, this would be most difficult. Kiva investors are very much appreciated by the ladies in the Trust Bank. The appreciate the lenders' generosity in funding loans. They send their most heartfelt wishes and gratitude to Kiva investors.

He didn't go to school because, during his childhood, he didn't like to go to school. But later when he had more understanding, he regretted it because he didn't value the opportunity that his parents gave him to go to school.  Now, as an adult, he says that he wanted to learn to read so that no one would deceive him, and he learned little by little to read and to sign his own name. He is the father of three children, ages 30, 25, and 23.  His wife takes care of the household tasks and also raises animals such as chickens, hens, ducks and a burro that they have. Of the children, two are partnered and only one lives with them. \r\n\r\nSantos has worked in agriculture for the past 37 years and learned how from his father.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to purchase a bag of fertilizer to apply the last fertilization to the corn crop and to pay the two workers who help him in the corn field.  He has the idea that with the loan he will be able to purchase the necessary supplies and hope that God permits him to harvest enough to pay off the loan and to to be able to leave some for consumption.
