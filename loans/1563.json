They do not want the two children to be illiterate. The whole family has to work hard and save money to cover her daughter's education fees. When the new school year began, she needed a loan to cover tuition costs for the children. \r\n\r\nMrs. Bieu  will work hard to repay the money to the M7 MIL organization. She hopes her children, thanks to the loan amount, will be further educated to have a brighter future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1886.64,"image":{"id":1708083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

He is 38 years old, and has two children who are currently in school. He oversees the operation of their Jeepney unit, and his income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nHe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which he is paid *boundary (daily quota) each day. His regular customers are his neighbours and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 every day. \r\n\r\nCuriously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippine.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\nNomer is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of his Jeepney unit. He will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Nomer dreams for his children to be able to complete their studies. He also wants to add another Jeepney unit.

and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her five children as a primary caregiver. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, tomatoes and also keeping dairy cows. Janeth has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. After her husband lost his formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family fell to Janeth. It has been overwhelming because she now has to shoulder the responsibility of feeding the whole family. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. \r\n\r\nJaneth is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nJaneth is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. She will also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets. Janeth believes that if female farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of the world's hungry could be reduced by half."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":309.26,"image":{"id":1708136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Previously, she used to wait till a customer presented an order with materials, this was due to low capital, which does not allow Sanura to buy her own materials.

Today, this humble mother of two children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and she is proud to wake up every day to milk her cow. Although she makes profits by selling milk, she lacks a proper dairy unit and is seeking a loan to build one. A good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax, and also prevents them from coming down with diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather such as rain.

Meet Rose, a young farmer from Ndanai, a remote village in Siongiroi, Kenya, who has defied the common thinking among most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation.\r\n\r\nRose practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the many agricultural training seminars she has been attending to broaden her skills. Her primary source of income is milk, and also she plants tomatoes on her farm and has named her tomato farm \u201cEver Blazing Farm.\u201d She also engages in personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture.\r\n\r\nAlthough she earns handsome profits from farming, she faces one big challenge: the high prices being charged for fertilizers, seedlings and inputs by the only agro-vet shop in her area. The Ndanai area has only one agro dealer catering to thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on him for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them extra amounts since he is the only agro dealer and enjoys a monopoly.\r\n\r\nRose wants to change this. She is requesting a loan to start an agro-vet shop. Through your loan, Rose will be able to help the smallholder farmers in her area who for a long time have had a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. \r\n\r\nThrough your loan, Rose will be able to seize this business opportunity and tap into the potential agricultural market. She will transition from the peasant farmer she is right now to being a certified agro dealer who will be depended on by nearly 1,000 smallholder farmers in her area both for input, knowledge and information about improved inputs.\r\n\r\nThrough increased income from the loan, Rose will improve her living conditions, and her future plans are to purchase a truck that will be used to engage farmers in output marketing activities. Rose believes that there is no doubt that youth like her can find rewarding employment in farming. She patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1708335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

His second job is as a day laborer where his vision is to help his neighbors in his community. He has become a great example in his community and for that reason a group of entrepreneurs has joined with Lucas to work together with him so they can become successful in the future and generate income for their families. \r\n\r\nLucas will use the money from the loan to buy fertilizer for the corn he grows.

Meet Lilian, a 28-year-old self-driven mother and a very hardworking and dedicated farmer. She is based in the village of Ndanai in a remote part of Siongiroi, a semi-arid area. The living conditions in the Siongiroi area are very tough, being a semi-arid area, and you need to have tough skin in order to survive there.\r\n\r\nLilian has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. She is happily married and is blessed with 3 children. She is a mixed farmer and has been practising farming for the past 8 years. She has never looked back and does not regret it.\r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income are milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She states that the most enjoyable thing about farming is selling produce in the market.\r\n\r\nLilian faces the challenge of lack of enough rainfall to produce very much on her farm. As a semi-arid area, Siongiroi is characterized by very little annual rainfall and scrubby vegetation. Lilian is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to start irrigation farming on her land. She believes that irrigation is the only way that she can improve her farming.\r\n\r\nThrough the application of water to her land, her crops will grow very well. Her proximity to a river source is an added advantage to her because she will use pipes to irrigate her farm.

She has a high school education and currently works in farming. She has one steer at the moment. Her children and grandchildren actively help Mirzaim around the farm, and her monthly income is about 9,000 KGS, including her pension.

unemployment and lack of capital. This is not true for Christine, 22, who is based in the Kitale area of Kenya and is a mother of four lovely children; she has been practicing mixed farming for the past four years. She has managed to earn a decent income. \r\n\r\nChristine's primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cow.\u201d Her hobby is milking Sofi (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and at the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. \r\n\r\nThe dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to expand her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nChristine is visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to

She is a smallholder farmer from Kwanza in Kitale, Kenya. She is the mother of 7 children. Like many farmers in the region, she keeps a dairy cow. Kitale has a thriving market for dairy products. Beatrice has sustained herself through dairy farming for four years now. She enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that she names each of them. She has aspirations of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Beatrice is kindly requesting KES 31,200 to purchase a high-yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, she will have more quantities for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, she will be able to service her loan on time. With increased income from the loan, Beatrice plans to spend money to settle the high farming cost of production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high cost of inputs. However, with increased income, Beatrice will not take such measures.

Meet Judy, a mother of five from Siongiroi, a remote village in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past two years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nJudy is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her birds. She is so close with her birds that she has nicknamed one of them Kipara, meaning \"no feathers on the head.\" \r\n\r\nJudy wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan of KES 20,000, which she will use to buy additional poultry. With your loan, Judy will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money. \r\n\r\nJudy is very concerned about her children\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay their school fees. Judy dreams of a secure future for her children.

This area experiences one of the best weather patterns, with weather that favors both crop and animal farming. Stella has been farming for the past seven years, and the income from it has enabled her to take care of her family and her parents, making sure that they have their basic needs met. Due to the high unemployment rate in Kenya, Stella could not find a job to support her family, but she didn\u2019t surrender to that. She started farming, and through mixed farming, she has been able to earn a decent income.<br \/><br \/>Stella is seeking a loan of KES 41,200, which she will use to buy a quality dairy cow. She wants to take advantage of the increased market for milk products. Having an entrepreneurial mind, she cannot let this opportunity pass by. Profits generated from selling milk and its products will be used to repay the loan, and to assist her family and the community. Stella intends to use the income generated to improve her living conditions and to impact society positively. She is a visionary, and she intends to start a big dairy shop where she will be selling milk products such as yoghurt and cream.

At home, she is a committed wife to her husband and a tender, loving mother to her two children. Her small family means the world to her, so she puts them at the centre of every single decision she makes in life. However, when she is not at home, she is a cream-of-the-crop marketer. She is armed with academic and professional formation that is a result of her international experience with leading brands across Africa, like Coca-Cola. How many marketers can take pride in having closed big deals in English, Kiswahili and French? Besides the multi-lingual edge, she is also an expert on marketing management, public relations, brand communications, trade marketing, social marketing and advertising. She desires to develop her career with Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that is transforming lives of Kenyan smallholder farmers. She is currently working as the Chief Marketing Officer of Juhudi Kilimo.<br \/><br \/>Mujeni is seeking a KES 300,000 loan, which she will use to pay for higher education. She is undertaking a Masters in Business Administration, at United States International University in Kenya. The course will help her to work with productivity objectives and targets aimed at the achievement of the company\u2019s short- and long-term goals. She needs this loan from Kiva lenders, because her income is tied up and the cost of the higher education is prohibitive. The biggest chunk of her salary is spent on general family expenses and her children\u2019s education. She became the breadwinner in her family, after her husband\u2019s travel business took a hit from a political calamity in Kenya, in 2007.<br \/><br \/>Growing up, Mujeni demonstrated strength, resilience, and perseverance, in the face of challenges and numerous personal battles. The passing of her father while she was still in high school left her devastated.  Her mother had to step up to the plate and look after seven children of her own, and seven more who were placed under her care, including one who got adopted. Seeing the struggle in the family, one of Mujeni\u2019s elder siblings sacrificed university education and took a low-paying job, which helped pay the bills and financed Mujeni\u2019s education.  <br \/><br \/>The struggle Mujeni went through only fueled her passion for learning and determination to succeed. She completed high school and took an undergraduate degree in French, Education, and Business Studies, at a local University. She landed a job as a Bilingual Executive Assistant in a reputable organization, soon after her graduation. It didn\u2019t take long for her manager to take notice of her natural passion, diligence, and willingness to learn. Within a very short time, she was entrusted with additional responsibilities in the marketing department.<br \/><br \/>The marketing responsibilities opened up a new world for her. She was so interested in marketing that she enrolled for a diploma course in marketing. Shortly afterward, she was made an Advertising Assistant. She was then made a Marketing Assistant, and later on a Brand Manager. There was no stopping her. She continued to displaying exceptional leadership skills and strategic thinking in every challenge she tackled. Finally, she was promoted to become a Senior Brand Manager, in charge of six African countries. <br \/><br \/>Last year, she joined Juhudi Kilimo as the Chief Marketing Officer. Her role is to help the company reach more poverty-stricken, rural, smallholder farmers in dire need of financial services, across East Africa. Having worked for corporations for a very long time, this opportunity is valuable to her because it presents her with a chance to switch to working for a social enterprise -- one that has a meaningful social impact on the lives of people in her community.  <br \/><br \/>She has been able to make great strides in life with the education and skills she possesses. However, it is not the end of the road for her, because she hasn\u2019t hit the pinnacles she plans to reach. With your loan, Mujeni will continue providing for her family, educating her children and three other siblings, and furthering her education without having to stretch her income further. The newly-acquired education will set her leadership and management skills at the next level.  She will use the newly-acquired skills to grow the company\u2019s brand and reach out to 100,000 rural clients by the end of 2015. <br \/><br \/>Invest today in a brighter future, and empower thousands of rural farmers in Kenya, by investing in this transformational leader, Mujeni!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1708432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

is married and a mother of five children.

She holds a positive view of this business succeeding, because she has a good business location and regular customers, and because she has been doing this work for a long period of time. With this business activity, the community will benefit from her moderate selling.  In addition, the distance to buy things from the market will be reduced for her customers, and her business will also provide satisfaction of basic needs for them. <br \/><br \/>Concerning the profit made from this loan, she will expand her business, pay her children's school fees, and save some money in order to undertake bigger investments.  Also, she will provide medication for her family.

Their second child is a college student, and the youngest is not yet attending school. Faustina\u2019s source of income is from an auto-electric shop. She has been in this business for more than 20 years now. Sometimes Faustina generates 30,000 PHP a month from the business. However, having a child in college is costly and Faustina wants to avail a loan of 25,000 PHP from Kiva lenders to improve her business. She plans to buy some electrical equipment. Faustina believes that the generous lenders will approve her request for this loan and that it will really help her achieve her dreams for her family and, most of all, for her

She currently lives with her daughter and collects a pension for part of her income; her main source of income comes from raising livestock and growing crops.  She first started in 1998, and currently has two dairy cows, ten sheep, and two bull calves on her farm, as well as 3.0 hectares of land for growing beans and potatoes as cash crops.  She sells milk from her farm daily, and is eager to grow her business and find additional ways to earn money for the sake of her children and grandchildren.  At the moment, her monthly income is 3,000 som, which is catastrophically low if you're seeking to expand your business; with that in mind, Gulmairam is seeking a loan of 120,000 som from Bai Tushum to buy 20 sheep.  These extra sheep will help bolster her income and allow her to invest more money into her business and grow it further."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":556.25,"image":{"id":1706561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"buy 20 sheep for fattening and resale to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Dobo village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-10T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-09T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulmairam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":741.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":556.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185.24,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10086.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.18,"payment_id":595436477},{"amount":173.89,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10086.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.53,"payment_id":636161312},{"amount":176.88,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10086.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.53,"payment_id":681290894}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T23:51:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":779815,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a married man, and he has three children.

He recently started a family business but he hasn't been able to fully launch it yet.

has four children and lives in the village of Kaplamai in the Kitale area of Kenya. As a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Jaribu Tena Self-Help Group. \r\n\r\nFor the past one year, she has been actively involved in mixed farming, and because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and fuel wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. \r\n\r\nThis has not been a setback because Eunice has been making great profits in farming. Eunice always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cKairu,\u201d which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. \r\n\r\nThrough her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. Eunice also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements, and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. \r\n\r\nModern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nEunice is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Eunice believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her child a solid educational background. This loan will be Eunice\u2019s way out of poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":544.6,"image":{"id":1708672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She decided to work in this business in view of the fact that there wasn't a store in her area where people could acquire products for the basic family food basket or for use in the home. It helps her neighbors, and in addition, she obtains income. She also butchers pigs and cattle to sell the meat and its derivatives.

used by many food business owners (restaurants) around Tanzania. Many customers comment that most of the food cooked using charcoal gets so tasty. This makes demand for it high compared to the level of production. The production does not match demand and this is due to limiting the level of destruction by the government. \r\n\r\nKuluthum is a customer who has been dealing in this type of business for five years now. She buys from big suppliers and resells in small packed bags. She sells up to two sacks per day and is able to make a fair monthly profit. Kuluthum is 32 years old, married, and has one son and one daughter who are in school. She dreams of managing a big store with more sacks to avoid frequent ordering, as she said it's costly. Kuluthum works from 6 am to 8 pm daily. \r\n\r\nFrom Tujijenge, Tanzania, this is Kuluthum's fifth loan request and she would like to use the loan to buy charcoal to resell in her store. She used the previous credit, since repaid, to grow her business capital and buy more stock. Kuluthum managed to earn extra income, which she plowed back into her business so as to grow it. She built a house and covered part of her children's school fees and home food expenses. Kuluthum is so thankful to everyone who supported and keeps on supporting Kiva borrowers. She will be accountable for paying back the loan.

She has a secondary education and has been involved in agriculture since 2000.  She currently owns one dairy cow, 40 head of sheep, and five hectares of land on which she grows beans, potatoes and maize.  Her delicious produce and milk are in great demand and allow her to make a good monthly income.  In order to further develop her farming business, Baktygul has turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" to request a loan of 120,000 som (KGS).  She will use 100,000 som from this loan to buy 20 head of sheep and some livestock feed.  The rest of the money will be used for the beans harvest.  In the future, Baktygul is planning to invest the earnings from her loan into further developing her farming business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1706593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Mahbuba was born in 1958. She is a kind and purposeful woman who has a great deal of experience in animal husbandry, having helped her parents with their livestock when she was a child. She doesn't have a higher education. She dreamed of attending university as a child but wasn't able to attend. Her experience with animal husbandry has become a source of income in her life. She fattens and sells livestock. Year by year, she has gradually developed her business.\r\n\r\nMahbuba now plans to expand her working capital and therefore is requesting a loan of 5,000 somoni to purchase livestock. She will use the revenue received to improve her living conditions. Since she is a widow, she is raising and caring for her three children on her own. She needs your support and awaits your kindness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1706688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle to increase her working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2014-10-11T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-10T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahbuba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":217.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":218.81},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":229.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":223.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":246.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":257.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":253.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":261.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":272.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":279.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":285.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":293.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":300.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":314.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":322.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":329.63},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":341.07},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":351.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":779859,"name":"Veasna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veasna is a 25-year-old freshman at a university, pursuing an education in architecture and engineering.

She is married and has 3 children with 2 of them currently in school. For the past 3 years, Feresta has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells essential goods like sugar, salt and water. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Feresta has requested a loan of 3,000,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential items for her shop.  This will help Feresta to generate greater profits, pay her children medical bills and improve their standards of living. Feresta hopes that in the future she will be able to start up a supermarket. \r\n\r\nFeresta is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She started pursuing her passion 12 years ago. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Sengera, a remote village in the Kenyenya area of Kenya. She is the proud mother of three lovely children. For the past 12 years, she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. <br \/><br \/>Matilda passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan, which she used to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. Matilda is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day. A liter of milk costs 50 KES; this means she will be making 11 USD a day. From this loan, the life of Matilda will permanently change and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children. She will also assure her aging parents of a secure future. Matilda waits for your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1708744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyenya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-11T06:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-10T06:50:09Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3680.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3787.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3898.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4012.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4129.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4250.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4374.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4502.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4633.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4769.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4908.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5052.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.63,"local_amount":3781.61,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3892.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625241},{"amount":45.37,"local_amount":3931.74,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4046.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194395},{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":3733.15,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3842.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823698},{"amount":47.69,"local_amount":4133.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4254.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262225},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":4135.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4256.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264321},{"amount":47.66,"local_amount":4130.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4251.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600523},{"amount":51.14,"local_amount":4432.05,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4561.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459016},{"amount":50.99,"local_amount":4576.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4709.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.81,"payment_id":681377376},{"amount":50.32,"local_amount":4547.21,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4680.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.15,"payment_id":696587124},{"amount":156.85,"local_amount":14598.53,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":15025.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.6,"payment_id":711505393}],"funded_date":"2014-10-15T01:41:01Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:49:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":779888,"name":"Eldeniz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eldeniz is 41, married and the father of three children.

She and her husband work hard to continually provide income for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nBeverly owns a banana and coconut farm. She grows mostly bananas and some coconut tress in their farm located in Silang. It is in the highlands where it is suited to fruit bearing tress like bananas and coconut.

She sells her product to market and fruit stores that she regularly supplies and to the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1,300 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales weekly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) loan, which she will use to buy fertilizer and farm inputs for her business.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nBeverly aims to expand her business by buying another lot for her farm. She dreams to be able to send all her children to college.

She is a 62-year-old mother who lives with her family in the Molo area of Kenya. She is blessed with three lovely children who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere because she wants to provide them a better future. Veronica was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years.  She is an early riser who goes to her farm to earn a living. Veronica has space on her farm to use for dairy farming. She respectfully requests a loan to buy a dairy cow. Molo is an area that has a high population and there is a high demand for milk. Veronica, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that need and earn extra income. She hopes that this loan will allow her to change her standard of living and expand her milk-selling business. Veronica plans to open a very large milk-selling business in the nearby shopping center and to package milk. She wants to be economically empowered. She knows that accessing funds is challenging, but with partners such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, she feels relieved to know that all her dreams will be achieved and she will be able to provide a secure future for her children and improve her family's living conditions.

He is a brilliant, humble, young leader who is the incumbent Chief Operations Officer at Juhudi Kilimo, the leading agricultural microfinance institution in Kenya. When he is not at work, he is a dedicated family man with a lovely wife and a charming daughter.\r\n  \r\nKimosop has come from very humble beginnings up to this point where he has made untold strides in both his personal and professional life.Kimosop is living proof that what matters is not where you are from but where you are going. He is seeking a KES 300,000 loan to pay for higher education expenses at a United States International University based in Nairobi. He says that \u201cA Masters Degree will equip me with the knowledge and practical managerial approach that I can put into action in the organization and create a positive impact on our farmers and communities in Kenya.\u201d  \r\n\r\nKimosop grew up in a small village near the Nakuru area of Kenya. As a young boy, he demonstrated a keen interest in learning. His predilection for knowledge made his parents strive to provide him with the best education they could afford. However, when he got to high school, he grew uncomfortable seeing the way his parents had to struggle to keep him in school. He made a promise to himself that he was never going to let them pay for his tertiary education. After high school, he started engaging in numerous small businesses. At first, he sold vegetables in a local market. After a while, he made enough capital to start a shoe mending business. The significant amount of money he made from being a cobbler gave way to the opening of a barbershop. Finally, the barbershop provided a more reliable and steady income that he could count on. He used the money he made from shaving people\u2019s heads to support his family and to enrol for a diploma course which later earned him a job at Juhudi Kilimo. Later on, he completed a degree course.\r\n\r\nSince joining Juhudi Kilimo, Kimosop\u2019s rise in ranks has become something of an urban legend within the company. He joined as a Credit Officer, then Senior Officer, then Regional Manager, then operations manager, then Chief Operations Manager within a very short time.  When he was asked about his secret, he replied, \u201cJuhudi Kilimo gives me great satisfaction, and I have never been as happy as now because every day I get to see the impact our loans have in transforming our farmer\u2019s lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the Chief Operations Officer\u2019s, Kimosop has observed that the success of Juhudi Kilimo brings with it new challenges and situations. \u201cJuhudi Kilimo has become more established and complex. Unlike five years ago, the industry today has more competition, issues with regulation, institutional inefficiencies, credit risks, and extended indebtedness of consumers. As the operations head, I am expected to provide strategic and operational leadership by working closely with a range of stakeholders against the reign of external uncertainties. The strength that got me this far is strong financial skills complemented by knowledge in social science, local language and cultural understanding. With a loan from Kiva\u2019s online Angels, the Masters Degree will sharpen my current skills in leadership, operations and strategic management. I will use the newly acquired knowledge and skills to integrate the growing niche of new products such as mobile phone-based banking and other developments to address social challenges such as green energy, climate change, health, and housing.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":1708767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Although she makes profits through selling milk, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \r\n\r\nAlice believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save the money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

She has a higher education, but for the last 28 years she has been in the animal husbandry business.

Meet Milkah, a mother of four lovely children - 3 boys and 1 girl. Milkah is based in Sengera, a remote village in the rich highland areas of Kenyenya in Kenya. This area is known for producing the best bananas and their staple food is \u201cmatoke,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. \r\n\r\nMilkah has been practicing mixed farming for the past 15 years and she has made great strides in terms of profit margins. This small scale farmer generates income through selling milk, tea and some personal business that she does, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it. She passionately loves poultry farming and the best part is when she wakes up every morning to collect eggs. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge facing Milkah is the constant perennial shortages of eggs and poultry products in her village and local market. She seeks to change this through a loan to buy more poultry. Milkah is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. With the loan, Milkah will increase her income through selling eggs, poultry meat and also poultry feathers. \r\n\r\nThe demand for poultry products in Kenyenya area is very high and through the loan she will be able to satisfy the demand. Other than profits from poultry farming, she will also benefit from poultry manure, hence saving money that would have been used in purchasing fertilizers. The additional income from this expansion will permanently change her life and improve her living conditions.

For the last 20 years, she has been in the livestock business.  As a result of her hard work, today Abiba has four cows, two horses, and 15 sheep.
