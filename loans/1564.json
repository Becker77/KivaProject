merchandise such as perfume, and footwear, which his does as a street vendor, moving around the neighborhood, through towns, in every place where he can get with the hope of achieving a sale to bring food to the house.\r\n\r\nBreihtner has always dreamed of having a retail space since the long distances that he has to travel to make a sale many times leaves him with little time to spend with his children, sit with them to see how they are progressing, help them with their homework, or just to share a friendly conversation. For this reason, he has decided to have a store and the quickest way to do this is to work, and work very hard. For this reason, he wants to ask for a loan to purchase merchandise, basically lotions and footwear.

Kenya. This lady who has now become a passionate crusader and practical dairy farmer who went into farming early, when their area was still in the dark about modern ways of profitable dairy farming. \r\n\r\nFor the past five years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk and some variety of crops she plants. Proceeds from dairy farming have always not been enough to support her two children. Ceciliah loves to take care of her dairy animals and has even nicknamed one of them \u201cBirir,\u201d which makes her a very proud farmer. \r\n\r\nCeciliah is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow so that she can fully utilize the space in her farm and so that she can seize the opportunity for the ready market for milk, that is in her village. Through increased profits Ceciliah will be able to comfortably provide for her children and will also be able to secure a future for her eventual grandchildren. Ceciliah is confident that if you invest in her, she will be able to turn around her life; and with the accumulated profits, she will be able to open a large milk shop that will sell to both wholesalers and retailers. \r\n\r\nCeciliah is patiently waiting for your

If it fails, then the people suffer a lot for their livelihood. So gradually people of this area are adopting alternative sources of income for a secure livelihood. \r\n\r\nLili is one of them. Apart from cultivation, for the last five years, Lili has been doing a tent house business (renting bowls, tent, cloth boundary wall, etc. for various functions) with the help of her husband. She initially started this business with limited items like bowls, chairs, tarpaulin, etc. From her small income she is gradually adding new items to her business. She is earning a monthly income of INR 4,000. With these limited earnings, it is very difficult on her part to manage her household expenses, the educational expenses of her children and business investment. So for the development of her business, she and 11 members of her village have formed a SHG named Maa Santoshi. Her portion of the loan is 16,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nConsidering the demand of the people, with the present loan Lili has decided to purchase a sound system, some more chairs, bowls, a water tank, mats, pillows etc. She hopes this will help her to generate a little additional income to meet her immediate requirements like providing better education to her children. \r\n\r\nShe has a long-term vision to construct a go-down to keep the tent house materials with safety and to build a good house for her family.\r\n\r\nOut of the other 11 members of the group, one member is running a general store, four members are doing cotton cultivation and six members are doing paddy cultivation. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1708875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of a sound system, chairs, bowls, water tank, mats, pillows etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"MOHARA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-10-11T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-10T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":3150,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalimba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhirendra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Draupadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasobanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayakanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyosna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lili ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pulastama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pushpanjali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shashmita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surjyakanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":192000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":776611,"name":"Ana Lidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica desde hace 12 a\u00f1os a la venta y elaboraci\u00f3n de quesadillas y pan de ma\u00edz, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su casa, pero tambi\u00e9n vende de forma ambulante por las diferentes colonias, Ana vive en casa propia con su esposo que es agricultor y su hija, ella est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la comprar de ma\u00edz, harina, az\u00facar, leche, moldes, etc. para continuar con su trabajo y as\u00ed poder tener con su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Ana, of 53 years of age, has worked for the last 12 years making and selling quesadillas and corn bread.

Her current profit is about 13,000 KGS per month, which covers her family's food and everyday living expenses. Valentina tries to put profits from the business into increasing her working capital; however, this year, since her three-year-old granddaughter is living with her, she needs to renovate her home and heat it.\r\n\r\nValentina has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to install ceilings and heated floors and to buy drywall, linoleum and interior and exterior finishing for the walls.

He carries loads and people from one place to another on his cycle-van and earns for the family. A cycle-van is a kind of carriage which is pulled using a bicycle and is widely used in rural areas by the regional people. But the income of her husband is very small and it is difficult to maintain the family. They decided to purchase another cycle-van and give it out for rent from which they will get a bigger income. \r\n\r\nThen Dhirobala came to hear about BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) and has taken a loan to purchase a cycle-van for carrying people and goods in their locality so that her husband can earn more than previously.

She is single. In 2010, Bridget established her drinks and food stuff business. She began her business because she wants to take care of her family and her personal needs. Her business is located in city center and her main customers are adults. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about SLL 500,000 every month from this business.

Meet Pamela, a 36-year-old caring, loving, and adorable mother of three children. She resides in the Kericho area of Kenya. Due to the lack of funds, Pamela never got an opportunity to further her education so that she could get a white-collar job, but that did not kill her dream of succeeding in life. She has been farming for the last 10 years on a small piece of land. Pamela enjoys working on her farm so much and has always been able to put food on the table for her family. Through practicing mixed farming (that is, crop and animal farming), she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Pamela enjoys dairy farming a lot and has even nicknamed her cow \u201cTuyai.\u201d This means that the cow produces a lot of milk. Pamela is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES to purchase farm implements and increase the poultry on her farm. There has been an increase in egg consumption in her area and the supply has always been low. This is why Pamela wants to take advantage of that and make good profits by selling more eggs and poultry products. Pamela will also use the farm implements to increase her crop production levels. Products such as fertilizers will be used to improve the production output. It can be said with confidence that if you invest in Pamela, you are investing in someone who will want to transform her life and the lives of those in society. In the next year, Pamela is projecting that she will have more poultry and be able to meet the demand in her area. Through the profits gathered, Pamela can comfortably pay off the loan and invest the other profits in her children's education.

The business brings in a total of 5,000 KGS per month.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Burulbubu has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to increase her head count of livestock by buying steers for fattening and resale.

Now they want to expand their business and decided to take a loan with nominal repayment conditions, which will help them to expand their existing wood business. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Madhabi has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BJS. Since Madhabi\u2019s husband is a well-educated person, he may able to review the present trend of fashion and the current market rate. This will help him to think differently to develop his business with the Kiva loan. Madhabi is thankful to Kiva and BJS. She is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes to his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1708941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase wood to expand her husband\u2019s existing wood business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-11T21:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-10T21:30:09Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madhabi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T21:26:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":780142,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita is 44 years old and has a live-in partner with three children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

She grows different vegetables, rice and fruit and sells them in the local market.  To cope with the growing price increase in essential commodities, she needs to cultivate more crops.  Thus, she decided to cultivate potatoes on their farmland because the vegetable is in high demand in the market. Also, potatoes are a very profitable crop, so she decided to cultivate potatoes to earn more profit. \r\n\r\nIn order to purchase seeds, insecticides and pesticides, Janaki applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner). This would help her to grow more crops, which will ultimately help in generating more income. This way, she can increase the profitability of her business and ensure her financial stability so that she can provide her family with a better quality of life and a better education for her child to reach a successful future.

The main objective of forming this SHG is to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their existing business. \r\n\r\nPuspamanjari, the simple but confident lady, is one of them who hails from a poor, landless family. The lady standing with her hand raised in the photo is Puspamanjari. She is twenty-eight years old and lives with her husband and a son of four years.\r\n\r\nPuspamanjari has been running a pressed paper plate and bowl making unit in her house for last five years with the help and support of her husband. Now she has two paper plate pressing machines. She supplies her products to the retailers of the nearest town and other villages in a ten mile radius. \r\n\r\nShe purchases raw materials like paper and polythene from the nearest whole sale market, 200 kilometers away, on a monthly basis.  She gets a monthly income of 5000 INR  from the above business. Out of this income she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. \r\n\r\nFor her quality product and timely delivery the demand of her unit is increasing day by day. But she is unable to meet the demands of the customers due to insufficient production. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. From the present loan, Puspamanjari has planned to purchase bulk of raw materials and purchase another press machine for making plastic glass. \r\n\r\nShe assumes, apart from getting additional income, this will also help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as well as attract more customers. Puspamanjari hopes to save enough to build a workshop for her business and provide a better education of her son. \r\n\r\nThe other eight members of the group are doing milk business, general store, chart and fry gram selling, rice vending and sugarcane juice selling.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1709156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase bulk paper  and another press machine for making plastic glass","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"CHANABEDA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-10-11T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-10T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrakanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dusila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gouriindhu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jashoda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ksharamati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nir ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspa Manjari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":132000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T23:48:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":780293,"name":"Domingas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Domingas is requesting a loan of US $1,200 to improve her business.

She has a secondary education, and is now retired.  At the moment, her pension is not enough to support her family, so she relies on agriculture to make an additional income.  Seynep started in this field many years ago, and thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns five cows and ten sheep.  She makes a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS), which is vastly insufficient to lead a decent life.  For this reason, and in order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners and requested a loan of 70,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy sheep for fattening and future resale.  The earnings from her loan will allow Seynep to develop her business and to improve the welfare of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1708108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase more sheep for fattening and resale, in order to improve the welfare of her family.

All her children are grown up and her youngest son lives with his parents and helps with the farm. She has a high school education and has been working in animal husbandry and agriculture since 1975, when she bought one heifer. Now she has two cows, 10 sheep and two horses, as well as a 1.5 hectare piece of land where she grows barley. \r\n\r\nKalys's total monthly income is 20,000 KGS per month, and she tries to put all of her profits back into developing her business. However, a need has arisen to build a barn for her animals, and therefore she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 40,000 KGS to purchase building materials to construct a barn. She will put profits from the business into further increasing her head count of livestock, which she will keep in the newly build barn over the winter."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1708111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 51 years old and has children. Wilfredo, her husband, works as a driver. She oversees the operation of their Jeepney unit and her income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nShe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) Jeepney, from which she is paid a *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 every day. Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippine.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the Jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\nCarmelita is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her Jeepney unit. She will use the profit to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants another Jeepney unit to be used for their business operation. She hopes to have their own house so they don't need to rent anymore. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1709468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

","en":"This talented woman is named Dilbar.  She is 43 years old and she and her family live in the Shahrituz region.  She has two sons and two daughters.  Dilbar's husband works in a city in Russia.  She and the children live on the outskirts of town and she doesn't have a job.  She wants to start her own  business to improve her family's living conditions.

For the last five years Salomat has been a family doctor in the primary care department.  She loves her profession because she likes helping people and making them healthy again.  Salomat's husband, like many men from their area, moved away to find work.  Salomat has two children.  Her 23 year old daughter is a teacher in a local school, and her 22 year old son is a student in an institute of higher education.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to pay her son's tuition, but Salomat doesn't have $1,000 (USD) for this purpose. She learned about MLO Humo and Partners' attractive loans and applied for one.  Salomat really hopes to receive this support.  It is very important that her son finish his education because he wants to become a highly qualified professional and start a good career in his field.

However, she is having financial problems to cover all the big requests she is getting. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan to buy fabric and make the garments for the Christmas season that is around the corner and will give her good incomes. \r\n\r\nHer wish is to increase her number of clients. For that she needs to produce and show in the market her quality and beautiful

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she requests 14,000 PHP to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of providing  her family with a good future through all her hard work on her business.
