She is married to Anthony, a fruit vendor, and they have children still in elementary school. She manages a fruit stand and her income from the business helps with their everyday needs and expenditures, including the cost to school their children.\r\n\r\nJosephine buys fresh fruit such as lanzones, rambutans, and calamansi, and her husband sells them. Lanzones are a famous fruit commonly grown in Southeast Asia like the Philippines. They are rich in vitamins which help keep skin healthy and boost the immune system. Rambutans are naturally red in color but sometimes are yellow or orange; research has shown that their content and benefits are similar to oranges and apples. Calamansi are small citrus fruit that are known to be a great source of Vitamin C, and their juice is popular for cleansing the body of toxins. Her fruit is marketable not only for its yummy taste but also health benefits. Josephine's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 24,000 PHP in monthly sales. \r\n\r\nWhile these kinds of fruit are always in demand, Josephine believes that sales will improve even more if she adds other food items to her selection. She is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan to purchase more fruit and to add processed meat to her inventory. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n \r\nJosephine dreams to become more successful in her business so that her children can get the best education and go to college. She wants her family to continue to love and serve the Lord together. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is comprised of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1709598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Disaster recovery"],"use":"to purchase fruit and some processed meat to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-12T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-11T17:20:04Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":373.35,"local_amount":16333.31,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":16714.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625531},{"amount":213.32,"local_amount":9333.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":9550.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535673},{"amount":159.99,"local_amount":6999.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7163.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134020},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2333.38,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2387.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756789}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T09:43:59Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":780473,"name":"Lory","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lory is a 49-year-old married woman with eleven children from Iloilo, Philippines.

local farmers.\r\n\r\nEdgar is applying for a loan that he will use to supplies--fertilizers and seeds, for example--that he needs for his next crop.  The investment will allow him to carry on his farming business and significantly improve his harvest.\r\n\r\nEdgar is optimistic about his business and has great hopes of the people that are helping him and the other hard-working farmers here.\r\n\r\nPlease support this modest man so that he can continue working his land.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1704584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy supplies for his farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-10-12T17:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-11T17:40:11Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":119040},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":122380},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125814},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":129345},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":132974},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":136706},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140542},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144485},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148540},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152708},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156993},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161399},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":165928},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":170584},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":175370},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":180291},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":185351},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":190552},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":195899},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":201396},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":207047},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212857},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":218830},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":224969}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.02},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.72},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.23},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.1},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.05},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":780491,"name":"Dashdavaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Dashdavaa, 47 years old, lives with his wife in Erdenet, third largest city of Mongolia.

She is a businesswoman managing a genge selling fruits, vegetables, rice and other foods. She has been in this project for one and half years now. She wakes up very early in the morning(4am) when she boards a bus to the market to buy stocks for her genge. It's so hard, especially waking so early everyday, but she has to do so for her family. Ester's business ends at 8pm each working day.  She is able to realize a fair monthly profit. \r\n\r\nFor the sake of improving her genge, she approached Tujijenge as Kiva partner to request business financial support. Her desire is to improve business and family, to be able to build a house and manage a big genge. This is her third credit request since she has been with Tujijenge. She managed to repay all previous loans successfully. Ester used these credits to maintain her business and covered school fees for her kids. She is the only parent responsible with her family, makeing sure that meals, medical and shelter expenses are covered. With a struggle, she managed to get an extra income which she used to buy a home TV,DVD deck and covered hospital expenses.

She is married to Camilo, a tricycle driver and has two kids. The eldest is still in the Preparatory Level and the youngest is not of school age yet. She manages her household while operating a business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal, household needs. \r\n\r\nJonalyn has operated a general store for the past seven years. (In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.) She earns a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also has a tricycle unit for a transport service, which her husband operates to earn additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 3,000 PHP per day. \r\n\r\nTo help her to continue to operate her general store business she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal , soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings helps her to meet her family's daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and Kiva for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes to maintain and grow her business. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1709731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has an intermediate education. For the past 30 years he has farmed and raised livestock. His current monthly income is around 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to his tireless work Kadyrkul now has a good farm with 2 cows, 10 sheep, a horse, and 10 hectares of land where he grows clover and barley for his own use and sale.

who are not in school yet. She has a higher education and has been working in a school for many years already. For five years Toktobu has been raising livestock and farming. The business began with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to tireless work Toktobu's property currently includes two cows, a horse, and 2.24 hectares of land where she grows barley to feed her animals. Toktobu came to the Bai-Tushum bank for a 45,000 som (KGS) loan to buy a heifer. She plans to use the income earned from the loan to further expand her livestock herd, and to create the opportunity to build an additional barn for her animals.

Her business is in makeup and manicures. She is entrepreneurial, responsible, consistent, hardworking, and very communicative. She carries out her work in house in different neighborhoods within her city both either where she lives or where her clients live. \r\n\r\nClaudia is of morena [dark] complexion and medium height. She has long dark hair and while her native language is Spanish she knows Guaran\u00ed as a result of her family's heritage. She is the first sitting on the right carrying a brown purse. \r\n\r\nDue to the need to get ahead, she became part of a group of people to request a loan and be able to work better in her business. Her work consists of doing manicures and makeup for all types of events. She does makeup for daytime, nighttime, evening wear, as well as for rejuvenation purposes, to look older, cover up and costume makeup, etc. In terms of manicures she first removes the nail polish with a regenerating, oil-based remover that does not contain acetone. Afterwards, she cleans the nails, and uses Bohemian crystal nail files followed by fixing up the cuticles and applying creams. She then applies a strengthening polish to the nails and finishes by painting them with designs or solid colors.      \r\n\r\nHer hope is to get ahead and enter into the world of hair styling by taking classes and giving it a try. Her dream is to have her own beauty salon and give classes on makeup, manicures, and hair styling. She wants to invest in her business by purchasing beauty products so that she can serve more clients. This is why Claudia is requesting a loan to purchase makeup and manicure products to develop her business.

Her educational level is minimal due to the lack of financial resources of her parents and the overwhelming need to work from an early age in order to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe has enjoyed all activities related to trade since she was young, in particular the buying and selling of seafood which she considers to be highly profitable as well as accessible as she lives within four kilometers of the seashore.\r\n\r\nEvery day in the early morning hours she takes a bus to the zone where she buys from local artisanal fishermen who have returned with the night's catch. She then sells with door to door service. She repeats this routine every day, and as long as she finds product for sale, she will buy for reselling. She has the appropiate equipment for seafood conservation (ice buckets).\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan she is requesting to buy fish, shrimp, lobster, mollusks and clams, since she does not have the capital to buy in greater quantities. Her client base has increased and she needs a larger inventory to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nMaristela is a tenacious worker and with her husband they have managed to provide for their children, instilling solid moral values in them and striving to give them an education so that they may be prepared and encounter better work opportunities in the future.\r\n\r\nMaristela is thinking that after this loan is repaid, she will solicit a bigger loan to upgrade her home (enlargement), since a few months ago one of her children found a life partner, and she would like to add a small bedroom so they may enjoy privacy as a couple.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1119.09,"image":{"id":1704430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Married to Zaldy, she has five children. Two are already working, two are in elementary school and one is not of school age yet. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment her family's income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nHaydee has operated a variety store for ten years. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also has a business where she sells pre-paid mobile phones. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 500 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal , soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are her family's source of income to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nHaydee hopes to maintain and grow her business, so she and her family can have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1709801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Turgunbu is known as a principled, honest, fair and trustworthy person. Her business currently brings in a monthly profit of 35,000 KGS from sales of milk and livestock and primarily from selling her crops.\r\n\r\nThis year, Turgunbu has decided to insulate and renovate her house. Therefore she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of $1,850 USD, about $1,000 of which will go toward buying plastic windows and doors. The rest will be used to purchase building materials for the renovations. These home improvements will make her home warm and comfortable and, in the future, help her save money on utility bills. As for profits from her farm, Turgunbu will be able to put them into further development of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1708835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase energy-efficient plastic windows and doors and construction materials to insulate and renovate her house, so that her family will be more comfortable and conserve energy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jylkol village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-13T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-12T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turgunbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1850,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":550,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436496},{"amount":900,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500130},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752025372}],"funded_date":"2014-10-29T07:50:00Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:02:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":780607,"name":"Vedaste","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vedaste is 32 years old.

She began her occupation in June 2007, working in a workshop located in the city center. She later specialized in several other workshops where she worked and finally made the decision to become independent, thanks to her experience. She was a big saver when she worked for others and that is why she was able to collect her first sum of money to buy materials, supplies, machinery and equipment. She had support from her relatives and her business today generates income that helps support their families. \r\n\r\nVanessa's work day beings at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 6:00 p.m. She buys and sells in shops in the city center that specialize in her type of products. She is currently applying for a Kiva loan. This is her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo foundation. With the loan, she will buy a flat sewing machine, a double chain stitch sewing machine, materials and supplies to make new models of bags and purses. With this investment she will increase her production and improve the finishing of her products. Her Kiva loan is an investment that will improve her business conditions. Her dream is to buy her own store, a home, and to have transportation for her deliveries. Her biggest challenge is to find sources of financing and increase the volume of her savings, which in the future, when she achieves her goals, will be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1704647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She has a business selling shoes. She is a good mother - hardworking, steadfast, responsible and dedicated. She has her business in the southern part of the city, an area crowded with commerce. Florinda has a dark complexion, long black hair, and is of tall stature; her native tongue is Spanish but she also knows Guarani through her family heritage. In the picture, she is in the middle of the back row in a floral blouse and beige pants.<br \/><br \/>She has two children who are in university and a husband who is also a merchant. She started a lending group so that she could ask for a loan because she needs more income in order to support her children until they finish their university degrees. <br \/><br \/>She sells clothing and shoes from door to door, together with her spouse.

She makes a living selling fried chicken. She is a good mother, responsible, dedicated, consistent and hardworking. \r\n\r\nHer business is located in the \"Plan 3000\" zone, an area characterized by the growing development of all types of commerce. The area is home to people from Guarayo province and farmers from the west, the principal victims of an ideology of marginalization that have impeded the sharing of municipal resources and has denied help to this group of people who do not have even basic services.\r\n\r\nMagdalena has a dark complexion, brown hair and average height. Her native language is Spanish and she knows Guaran\u00ed through her family heritage (back row, third from right, white blouse). Because she has to continue working and support her children's school expenses, she formed a communal bank to request a loan. She shares her life with her partner and two children who attend school. Her business is the sale of fried chicken. It is prosperous and she has many customers. Her business is open from 6 in the evening. In the morning she is responsible for buying, transporting and preparing the food so that it is ready for the night. \r\n\r\nHer business is out in the open air. She only has a kitchen but not a refrigerator, so she cannot freeze or store food. She dreams of having a roof for her business and a room where she can store provisions. Her wish is to buy a freezer to store the chicken and to buy provisions at wholesale. For those reasons Magdalena is requesting a loan to buy a freezer and wholesale provisions to expand her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":1705324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer and provisions at wholesale to expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-10-13T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-12T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":17500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1126.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1146.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1167.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1188.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1210.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1232.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1242.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1288},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1301},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1324.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1348.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1373.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1398.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":498.88,"local_amount":3423.71,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3447.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561646075},{"amount":343.36,"local_amount":2356.42,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2372.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556569},{"amount":355.97,"local_amount":2442.97,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2459.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157253},{"amount":558.37,"local_amount":3831.87,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3858.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554152},{"amount":389.56,"local_amount":2673.45,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2691.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226693},{"amount":403.86,"local_amount":2771.58,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2790.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213875}],"funded_date":"2014-10-19T22:01:08Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carrie N.","image":1077468}},{"id":777675,"name":"Prosperidad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Orfelinda de 29 a\u00f1os de edad es separada y tiene 02 hijos dependientes.

They sell cooked rice and beans, kids' wear, shoes, kitchen sets, earrings and necklaces.\r\n\r\nThey want to improve their stock levels. The group works with Kiva's field partner, ID Ghana. This will be their first group loan. Mercy (standing on the far left in the photo) is well known for selling earrings and necklaces.

He lives with his parents and eight siblings (four brothers and four sisters).  He is the third child and eldest of the brothers.\n\nLuis is very interested in his Mechanical Maintenance Engineering Technician career because it has allowed him to obtain formal work in the short term so he can support his parents regarding the education of his younger siblings.  This is one of his personal goals for the future.\n\nLuis is doing his technical degree with SENATI, one of Peru's premier technical degree programs. 95% of SENATI students find employment within their technical degree within 3 months of graduation. For this reason, and because of a promising labor market, Luis feels this is a good investment in his future.\n\nPrior to this loan Luis was supported by his mother who paid his tuition while he worked to pay for the other fees, so he works and studies at the same time.  Because of his efforts he never stopped studying but now he is in a situation which does not allow him to enroll in his last course - meaning he will not be able to graduate.  Therefore he is seeking economic support to finish his degree on time.  \n\nLuis is grateful for the opportunity KIVA is giving to people with low incomes who cannot finish their education, because thanks to the lenders many people will be able to realize their dreams of becoming well-trained professionals, capable of providing a good life for themselves and their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1705461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his final semester in Mechanical Maintenance Engineering so that he can obtain his degree and become a titled professional","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":358,"posted_date":"2014-10-13T09:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-12T09:30:04Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Marino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1668,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1668}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":674.29,"local_amount":671.47,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":674.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579597667},{"amount":296.15,"local_amount":294.91,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":296.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595187735},{"amount":52.83,"local_amount":52.61,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611811602},{"amount":651.73,"local_amount":649.01,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":651.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624256273}],"funded_date":"2014-11-04T21:07:16Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:02:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":777694,"name":"Scarli Yulissa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Scarli es microempresaria emprendedora, que tiene la edad de 21 a\u00f1os, casada y madre de un hijo, tiene su propio taller de costura, impulso este negocio hace cinco a\u00f1os con ayuda de su familia, este oficio lo aprendi\u00f3 de su mam\u00e1, quien desde peque\u00f1a le ense\u00f1\u00f3 y luego su pap\u00e1 le regalo una maquinaria para que empezara su propio negocio, y su esposo le dio ayudo para la compra de materia prima.

The various economic supports that she has asked for have been a great help despite knowing that they are people who trust an unknown person supporting her with a grain of sand so that she can get ahead and grow in the field in which she works.  It is for this that she is grateful and happy because COMIXMUL takes her into account and opens its doors to her to be part of this group of borrowers with low interest rates and payment arrangements which before she couldn't find.

But for Jane, 40, who is based in the Kisii area of Kenya and is a mother of 2 lovely children, she has been practicing mixed farming for the past 8 years. She has managed to earn a decent income.\r\n\r\nHer primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about her business, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking Nyamotika (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise.\r\n\r\nJane is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling and selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1709916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

In addition, the business created a training program for young people in the field. \r\n\r\nThe business has made a conscious effort to reflect the real fashion identity of Haitian youth. The quality of the products produced by the business has retained clients for years. Years ago, thanks to a previous Zafen loan, the business was able to purchase a sewing machine and furniture, and created two full-time jobs. \r\n\r\nToday, the business is devoted to doubling its production and services.

district in Odisha, India. She is a very active and confident lady. Jasoda, standing fourth from right in the photo with light blue saree, hails from a schedule caste poor family. Schedule caste people are considered to be the deprived section of the society. She lives with her husband, two sons of 18 and 15 years and one daughter, aged 13 years. Her children are continuing study in local college and school. The lady standing with raised hand close to Jasoda is the leader of the group.\r\n\r\nJasoda has been running a spice selling business with items like chili, cumin seeds, coriander, etc. for the last 10 years. Her husband goes to five weekly markets in her locality in a week with bulk of items in a bicycle and sells in the markets. Apart from this, she is also running a small general store in her house. Her monthly income from the existing business is INR 6,000. Out of this income she hardly manages her household expenses and the educational expenses of her children. \r\n\r\nTo increase the income for smooth management of her family, in August 2014 Jasoda along with 12 other women entrepreneurs of her village, formed a self-help group named Om Sairam and availed a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. From her loan of 16,000 INR she wants to purchase items like chili, coriander, cumin seed, etc. in bulk to keep the stock for a month. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently and she can add a substantial income to her present income. \r\n\r\nJasoda hopes to purchase a bike to run her business smoothly with sufficient items and provide better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of the group are also doing business like tailoring center, animal trading, vegetable cultivation and cloth business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1710105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water-borne diseases.\n\nThe water filter also increases the disposable income of users like Souban because of the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal, the decreased time spent foraging for wood, and by decreasing  the amount of money used to purchase

She has lived in the city of El Sauce all her life, and  for more than twenty years has worked as a primary school teacher in the school of the community of San Jose, located 5 kilometers from the urban population center.\r\n\r\nAna is grateful to God and to the Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they have offered she finished preparing her children for their professional careers.  At one point she had two studying in the university at the same time, and this made it difficult for Ana and her husband to cover those costs with the low salaries they earn.\r\n\r\nRight now she needs a loan to improve her health, planning to have medical exams, ultrasounds and to buy medications.  She hopes to continue to receive support.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1358329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":" to carry out medical exams, ultrasounds and buy medications","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2014-10-13T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-12T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Concepci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":534.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":693.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":714.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":744.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":789.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":808.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":844.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":869.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.89},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.15,"local_amount":651.65,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-25T10:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":713.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":583281372},{"amount":30.13,"local_amount":723,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-30T10:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":791.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":597936615},{"amount":23.67,"local_amount":568.23,"processed_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":622.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611761165},{"amount":31.03,"local_amount":744.77,"processed_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":815.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624204925},{"amount":32.89,"local_amount":789.21,"processed_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":864.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636511059},{"amount":33.7,"local_amount":808.75,"processed_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-29T12:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":885.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":652426898},{"amount":35.2,"local_amount":844.8,"processed_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-30T12:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":924.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665413404},{"amount":36.23,"local_amount":869.59,"processed_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":952.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683474214}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T02:42:12Z","paid_date":"2015-12-01T13:14:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Heatherly","image":1523379}},{"id":779045,"name":"Srikandi 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is the fifth loan for the Srikandi 2 Group.

He is 54 and a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Vicenta and has four children. Two of his children are in high school and the other two are already working. His wife manages their household while he operates their business. He works hard to continually provide income for their daily needs and the schooling of his children.\r\n\r\nDominador owns a pineapple farm. He has been growing pineapple for two years and it has helped him sustain the needs of his family. Silang is in the highlands, which is largely farmland. Pineapple is one of the favorite fruits\/desserts of Filipinos. He sells his product to the market and fruit stores that he regularly supplies and to the local community. He earns a minimum of 10,000 PHP in sales monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan, which he will use to buy fertilizer and farm inputs for his farm. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to him.\r\n\r\nDominador dreams of being able to plant different kinds of fruits and vegetables to increase his sales. He dreams of sending all his children to college.

She currently has two cows and thirty sheep on her farm, as well as a plot of land for growing beans as a cash crop.  She also sells milk to earn some additional money.  She has everything needed for raising livestock: summer and winter barns, chicken coops, and feed for her animals.  Her monthly income is 10,000 som, but this isn't enough for her and her children to live comfortably.  As such, she's seeking a loan of 125,000 som from Bai Tushum to buy 25 sheep for fattening and resale.

She has 20 years of participation in this program. Her family has a plot of land for planting coffee and corn.

She has two children, and they are both married. She has been a member of M7-MFI for fourteen years, with ten past loan rounds. \n\nThe main income for her family is from planting corn, sugarcane, cassava, and coffee, and with funding supported by M7-MFI, she invested in the purchase of inorganic fertilizer for plant investment. After a long time, she found that the use of inorganic fertilizers has many components that directly affect drinking water. More fertilizers will cause discolored land, and productivity is not highly effective. Therefore, she decided to transfer from inorganic fertilizers to organic fertilizers, and this change requires more funds to invest.\n\nMrs. Phong hopes that with this new loan, she will invest in the plantation and gain high productivity, while also contributing to environmental protection. In the future, residents of where she lives will transform their farming practices, improving the quality of life for the community.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2586.96,"image":{"id":1708085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She and her family live in Mai Son district, Son La province. Her family consists of five members: Loan, her husband, and three small children. Having many school-age children causes her family a lot of financial difficulty. She wants all of her children to have the chance to go to school to be literate and to escape poverty. \n\nShe was recognized as a member of M7 MFI in 2009 when she got her first loan to build a mud-walled house with room for her children to stay and study. During the repayment period, she was always as an exemplary member who complied well with M7 MFI regulations. After years of use, her family's house has deteriorated, so she needs more funds to renovate the house. With this loan, she and her family wish to have better living conditions, which would  improve and enhance the health and morale of the

Her family has four members, including Xom, her husband, her son and her daughter, who are all hardworking.\r\n\r\nHer family's main occupation is farming year after year with fields in the mountains, but it is just enough to eat. She thinks it is because of living in such a remote area, as she has less access to scientific and technical progress in crop variety and farming techniques to increase productivity. She thinks that if she wants to change her situation, she needs to have capital that she doesn't have. Therefore, she really wants to borrow a loan to buy fertilizer for her coffee garden to create more income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that the loan will help her family fertilize the coffee garden well and that the next coffee season will bring her family a better crop. She will work hard to earn money to repay M7 MFI on
