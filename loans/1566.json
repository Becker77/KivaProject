She is 32 years old and she is happily married to Robert. God has blessed them with three children and all of them are still studying. Life indeed is hard. But by the grace of God, they were able to raise their children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nRowena owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, aPhp5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg and other things. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price, then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby, and the people in the community. She earns Php 300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting Php 8,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nRowena desires to expand her variety store someday.

She considers the fact that she has stayed married for 24 years and given life to three children a blessing. It is the love for her family that keeps her going as she struggles to raise money for her children's education fees, including college fees for her first born who is 24.\r\n\r\nJanet was born second last in a family of seven children. She describes her upbringing as \"challenging.\" The only way out of the hard life she knew was through hard work and persistence. She carried these tributes over to her business life. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, she decided to utilize her husband's 0.4-acre piece of land to keep poultry for egg production. Originally, she had used the space to grow vegetables, bananas and trees.\r\n\r\nShe considers herself to be much more hardworking than most farmers. She is also always eager to seize new business opportunities that cross her path.\r\n\r\nJanet is seeking a KES 60,000 loan to purchase dairy goats and more poultry to add to the 10 hens that she already has. The more hens, the more eggs, which will give Janet more chicks and more income. The goats will be used for meat and milk production. Many parts of the animal are economically valuable for a variety of purposes such as the skins for leather and the pelts for rugs. \r\n\r\nIncome from this investment will enable her to help her children build a strong foundation for a brighter future through education.

The district stretches as a thin thread from north to south along both coasts of the river Vakhsh. The weather conditions in the district are mild and suitable for farming and animal husbandry, and this is why the majority of the population is involved in these types of businesses.\r\n\r\nMavlyuda is a hardworking and honest woman. She has been involved in farming - growing agricultural crops - for about 35 years. She loves her work and is proud of it.

farmer named Jacob and his family of four lovely children. He is a hardworking man and aggressive with the principle of truth on his lips; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. \r\n\r\n\u201cKaplamai\u201d in the local dialect means \u201cvalley\u201d. In this valley are a people who, in their totality, constitute wrenching statistics. Hardcore poverty pervades every homestead yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about 5,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible. They are like the bones in the \u201cvalley of dry bones\u201d that required only a breath to spring back to life. \r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, Jacob has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past 7 years. His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry and some \u201cside hustles\u201d he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. The Kaplamai area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a sea of people but the mill keeps breaking down; hence farmers are not able to grind their maize. Jacob intends to change this and is requesting a loan to buy an electric posho mill, which will grind corn or maize into flour. Maize meal is very common in Kenya and is a staple food for many communities. Many Kenyan families consume the maize product \u201cugali\u201c (hard porridge) regularly. The market usually provides sifted flour, but the cost is higher because of the sifting and packaging. Cheaper flour can be obtained by milling the maize directly using a posho mill. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Jacob will be able to grind maize faster because he will use an electric posho mill. Cases of breakdown will be long history because electric posho mills are more reliable. This loan will assist Jacob to permanently change his life and achieve his life mission of driving economic development and poverty alleviation in communities in arid and semi-arid areas. Profits from the posho mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan, which Jacob promises to fully repay on time. In the next two years, Jacob sees himself as a very established businessman who will be running more than one posho mill in his remote village. Jacob patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":820.28,"image":{"id":1710516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

On his small plot of land, he keeps goats and grows bananas and other crops using irrigation. He is also a very keen observer of the market dynamics. He believes the market is the most important factor in business because it dictates what products are produced. \r\n\r\nJustus is seeking a loan to purchase dairy goats. He will also use the money to expand his horticultural farm. Goat's milk demand is increasing by the day. Taste and preference is slowly shifting to goat milk because it compares favorably in nutritive value with cow's milk, but it contains smaller fat globules that make it easier to digest. \r\n\r\nJustus will use money from this investment to provide the best for his child. His difficult upbringing motivates him to strive to provide better for his child. His dropping out of school in form 1 forced him to get in the real world and make a living. He stopped believing in luck as he hustled for survival. Today, he has goats that produce milk for sale, he supplies bananas that he grows at Nkubu market, and he also owns a motorcycle that helps him ferry goods and passengers. \r\n\r\nJustus has grown to be independent. He considers himself to be more confident and hardworking than most people are. He grows trees on his farm because he believes human activities are responsible for climate change.

He lives together with his wife with whom he has been married for 22 years! The couple has been blessed with 4 children, the youngest being 14. Mugambi has been farming for the more than 25 years to provide for his family. He grows bananas among other crops using irrigation. He also works in a quarry. \r\n\r\nMugambi is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements and expand his banana farm. Old farming equipment are worn out, inefficient and uncomfortable to use. This tools frustrate the users and deteriorate the overall quality of work. Use of inferior and outdated tools was one of the major obstacles for the expansion of his banana farm. \r\n\r\nYour loan investment will kill two birds with one stone. He will purchase modern tools that are much improved and efficient and use the remaining amount to pay for input costs of growing more bananas. This business maneuver is unlikely to go wrong because he has invested on irrigation which has worked out very well in the past.  \r\n\r\nMugambi did not receive much education because he had a difficult childhood. However, through years of experience and discipline, he has trained himself to always record his expenses and keep a monthly budget. Returns from the investment will go to loan repayment and his children's education.

This is the sad story of Patrick, a youthful 51-year-old Mzee (old man), a wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Kitale, in the northern Rift Valley region of Kenya. Patrick's farming experience dates back to 2000. \r\n\r\nLike many other farmers in the region, maize is a staple crop which he has been planting for as long as he can remember. With time, the fertility of his land has started to dwindle and whenever he plants maize the yields go down with each cropping season. Patrick has also been affected with weeds he recalls that at some point a strange but nice looking weed which produced purple flowers emerged and started to slowly colonize his farm causing his maize yields to decline even further. At some point he could not be assured of harvesting anything at all. Patrick's initial thought was that his farms had been bewitched, a notion that made him feel helpless. \r\n\r\nToday, Patrick is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy fertilizers, pesticides and good quality seeds. Through this loan Patrick is going to increase his crop production and this will translate to improved income level. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Patrick and there is no doubt that you can find rewarding employment in

She has finished junior college. As a main source of income for her family,  Aku raises livestock, having launched this business 20 years ago by buying cattle for 3,000 KGS. Thanks to Aku's hard work, her farm at present includes two cows, one horse and 10 sheep. She also has 1.5 ha [3.7 acres] of land, where she grows sainfoin [a herb used for animal fodder], barley and garlic. Her total monthly revenue is 8,000 KGS on the average.

Introducing you to Joseph, a 65-year-old honest, hard-working and ever-smiling father of 8 adorable children. He hails from Nyamira in Kenya, a banana-growing area where the staple food is \u201cmatoke\u201d, a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. Joseph has been involved in farming for the past 25 years and he owns dairy cows that produce milk for sale. Besides his dairy cows, he also keeps poultry and when you visit his farm you will witness tea growing as well as a variety of vegetables.\r\n\r\nJoseph has a passion for dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cNyabarati\u201d (from a person's name); but all is not well for this humble man. He is facing the challenge of the lack of a proper dairy unit which is why he is seeking funds to construct a proper dairy unit. With your loan, he will be able to better manage his dairy farm and create more value. A better dairy unit will assist Joseph to save more money because his cows will never be sick and this will also boost his dairy's milk production. Through building a dairy unit with the loan, Joseph will be able to collect the cows' by-products, namely, cow dung and urine which can be sold or better yet used on his farm. With a dairy unit, he will be able to better feed his animals and collect by-products such as dung to generate biogas fuel, make organic fertilizer and plaster his hut. The money that he will earn from the dairy unit will be reinvested back into the business to create growth.

Meet Esther, a hardworking, very honest and warm-hearted farmer who hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Esther is the proud mother of four lovely children whom she adores and always protects. \r\n\r\nEsther's upbringing was very challenging, and because of this, she promised herself that she would work hard to get out of poverty. That is why she started farming six years ago. Through farming, she has been able to earn a decent income. Esther is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her four children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life.\r\n\r\nEsther is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticultural farming. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Esther is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change. \r\n\r\nThrough the income from horticultural farming, Esther will assure her children of a bright future and will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her.

She is 32 years and is happily married to an old man of the age of 67 years.  They have together three children besides the seven children from the first wife who died.\r\n\r\nHer husband is frail as a result of advanced age. He also suffers a chronic illness and his age also limits his working abilities.  All the children attend school and as a family they have a challenge of paying tuition for better education.\r\n\r\nAs a family, they have some small rentals which generate some of the school fees and the remaining part of the school fees is obtained through hustling.  Quite often the children are sent back home for lack of school dues and this hinders their academic excellence at school.\r\n\r\nThe husband no longer works because of his health; he is dependent on the wife.  This leaves Jackie with the burden of caring for the family given that she is the sole bread winner in the family.  As a result she also engages herself in agriculture.

Janette decided to turn her love for garage sales into a business, starting Treasure House, a pop-up vendor specializing in resale items. Her familiarity with the reselling\/garage sale sector means she saves money, which she then passes on to her customers.\n\nSince starting Treasure House, Janette\u2019s primary difficulties have been in securing capital to fund inventory and in securing transportation to take her to local flea markets and garage sales. She will use her Kiva loan to pay for a van that she will use to transport her inventory.\n\nJanette hopes to grow her business to the point where she will be able to leave behind the days of loading and unloading her van on a regular basis. She also hopes to open her own dollar store, with the goal of providing a heretofore unseen level of quality at the $1 price point. \n\nWith the help of generous Kiva lenders, Janette\u2019s dreams

Nancy trained in jewelry making three years ago, and now leads a group of deaf women who make jewelry for sale in Kenya and with Sasa Designs by the Deaf, a non-profit partner organization in the United States. Sasa Designs by the Deaf has doubled their sales figures every year since training and operations started. \n\nThis loan is for $8,000 to purchase leather,beads and other materials for the group's largest purchase order to date (nearly 2000 pieces!). It will also help pay artisans fair wages and cover operating costs leading up to holiday production. This is the fourth purchase order they have received from this vendor - proof of the quality and consistency of the group's production. \n\nThrough her vision, leadership and technical skills, Nancy is helping demonstrate the potential of the artisan sector and the true ability of women who are learning to overcome social stigma and isolation.

His parents divorced when he was a child and his mother is in another relationship with a man who Diego sees as his father.  They live with Diego's three siblings (two sisters and a brother).  His mother is a seamstress and also sells marmalades.  His father is retired.\n\nEver since he was little Diego was interested in his career.  He thought it was interesting and feels it will help him economically, especially once he becomes a professional which is his goal. Diego is doing his technical degree with SENATI, one of Peru's premier technical degree programs. 95% of SENATI students find employment in their field within 3 months of graduation. For this reason, and because of a promising labor market, Diego feels this is a good investment in his future.\n\nDespite the low incomes of both parents they do everything possible for Diego to continue his studies.  Diego is pictured here with his parents, who are proud of how far he has come. \n\nUnfortunately, due to the bad economic situation they are now experiencing they are unable to continue supporting him.

It comprises distinctive and hardworking women members who hail from Birniya, a small village in the Deoghar district of Jharkhand. These members, who run various small businesses, have collectively approached MESP (Micrograam\u2019s field partner) for a loan of INR 45,000. \r\n\r\nLakhi has livestock and her husband is a building contractor. He has been doing this business for the last 10 years. Lakhi has two sons and a daughter. One son is working as a teacher\u2019s assistant and the other two children are studying. The family income is not sufficient to meet the family expenses, so Lakhi planned to take a loan from Kiva to invest in her husband\u2019s business, which will help her to increase her family's monthly income. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the members of the group need the amount to improve their livelihoods. All of these members have been running their own businesses for a long time now.

When she started the business in 2012, she owned only one bemo. As the business developed with steady income of about IDR 200,000 per day, she was able to buy one more bemo in 2013. Now, she has two bemos and employs two drivers and a conductor (the one who collects money from the passengers). With these two bemos, her business income increased to IDR 400,000 - 500,000 per day. \r\n\r\nBut the maintenance cost for these vehicles is high. Recently, one of the bemo\u2019s engines needed to be repaired. In order to do so, she applied for an individual loan from TLM amounting IDR 10,000,000.

She is skilled in sewing and has been involved in sewing Tajik women's dresses for 33 years. Oimniso is married and a mother of six children. Her children are 20, 17, 14, 11, 7 and 4 years old. As you can see, she has a big family, and Oimniso's husband, Oimniso and her oldest son, who now works in Russia, all work to provide for such a big family. They live a modest life, and their income is barely enough to cover the family's expenses. Due to this, Oimniso wants to expand her sewing business in order to increase her income. She requested this loan due to a lack in finances. Oimniso is planning to use this loan to buy a new, modern sewing machine and also other necessary sewing accessories. In the future, Oimniso plans to use the profit from her business to marry off her

Because her family became bigger - Irina and her husband did not have their own children and took in three orphans - a need for a larger living area arose. When Irina adopted the children, she and her husband did a Euro-repair at home. After the work was done, a storm tore off a roof from their home, walls and ceiling got wet, plaster fell off, and everything had to redone from scratch plus a new roof had to be installed.\r\n\r\nNow Irina really wants for each of their children to have their own room because the children are growing up and need their space and calm atmosphere. Financial means are necessary to expand the house and building additional rooms.

She also grows vegetables, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. \r\n\r\nIn African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. \r\n\r\nAgnes, however, is taking this a little step further. She is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes. The demand for vegetables and other greens is always high. Income from this venture will cover the high farming expenses she has to deal with currently. In the long run, with increased income, she will finally be able to satisfy her family\u2019s basic needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1710819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-14T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-13T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.15,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.35,"local_amount":4831,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4838.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680936},{"amount":46.94,"local_amount":4172.71,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625261},{"amount":51.85,"local_amount":4608.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4615.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194419},{"amount":50.22,"local_amount":4463.58,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4470.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823722},{"amount":55.09,"local_amount":4897.3,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4904.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262242},{"amount":135.19,"local_amount":12016.47,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12034.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264344},{"amount":166.13,"local_amount":14767.49,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":14789.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459032},{"amount":107.08,"local_amount":10242.46,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10257.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.15,"payment_id":711505406}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T19:53:46Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":781352,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida is a farmer from Dulag, Leyte.

Yaroslav, his wife, two children and mother live in their own two-story house. The second floor of the house does not have a bathroom. Yaroslav has been planning to build a bathroom on the second floor for a long time, but priority always went to other financial concerns that had to be resolved. This time, Yaroslav decided not to put off his goals anymore and invest 40 000 hryvnia into repairing the bathroom prior to the birth of his third child, whom his wife and he are expecting in the coming months.

Meet Salina, a mother of four from Kapsowar, a remote town in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past five years of her life farming. She sells milk, poultry, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nSalina is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutrient value. She is so keen and close with her cows, she has named one of them \u201cKoroi\u201d. Milking \u201cKoroi\u201d makes Salina very proud, and she feels fulfilled.\r\n\r\nDairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Salina wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to grow with. She is requesting a loan which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Salina has planted Napier grass, so feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once she acquires the additional dairy cow. \r\n\r\nThe 'exotic' cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk selling will allow Salina to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products, such as cream, yoghurt, and cheese.

Susan is a very dedicated farmer who has a never-say-die attitude and enjoys every bit of farming because, through farming, she is able to take care of her family\u2019s needs and wants. Although she experiences challenges in farming, her attitude keeps her going. Enjoying what she does, she has even nicknamed her cow \u201clovii.\u201d Susan is seeking a 40,000 KES loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used to cut hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forages. This assists the animal in digestion and prevents the animal from rejecting any part of the food. With the loan, she would be able to increase her milk productivity and also increase her income levels, hence reducing the poverty level that is currently facing her.
