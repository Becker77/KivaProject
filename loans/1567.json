Moreen is 17 years old and lives in the town of Bugiri in the Iganga region of Uganda. For the past four years, Moreen has been working hard to manage her food stall, where she sells bananas. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Moreen requested a loan from BRAC Uganda for 500,000 Ugandan Shillings, which she will use to purchase more bananas. This loan will help Moreen generate greater profits and pay for her siblings' school fees. Moreen hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nMoreen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills

She is 17 years old and lives in the town of Busia in the Iganga region of Uganda. She has no children. For the past two years, Riiyeli has been working hard to manage her fish vending business, which sells fish. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Riiyeli has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fish and will help Riiyeli to generate greater profits and increase her quantity. Riiyeli hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a restaurant. \r\n\r\nRiiyeli is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills

It is a vibrant and impoverished town. Nearly the entire population of the municipality is made up of ethnic K'iche' Maya who speak the K'iche' language. The population of the township is estimated to be between 50,000-85,000 individuals with about 10% living in the busy established town center and the remainder living in the outskirts. \r\n\r\nPascuala is a 31-year-old widow who is a member of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres Negociantes Nahuala\u201d meaning \u201cBusinesswomen of Nahuala\u201d.  She has the responsibility to care for three young children who range in age from a year to six years old. Pascuala shares , \u201cI have to fend for my children and take care of all of their needs.\u201d Three years ago, she opened a small shoe store where she sells footwear for women, men and children. The business is going well but Pascuala wants to attract  clients and increase revenue. She is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge to purchase more inventory. Pascuala wants to be sure to have many styles and sizes of shoes available because this is a busy time of the year with various special  events including graduations, holidays and the beginning of a new school year. \r\n\r\nThese ladies also receive educational training once a month to enrich their knowledge about leadership, empowerment and self-esteem, women's health, nutrition and hygiene, as well as the use of medicinal plants. They also learn how to manage their loans effectively with information about budgeting, business planning, accounting, marketing and customer service. Friendship Bridge calls this effective combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nPascuala and her friends in the \u201cMujeres Negociantes Nahuala\u201d Trust Bank are anxious to secure these loans and invest in their small businesses. Most of the ladies have traditional textile businesses and so there are always supplies that they need to purchase to sustain or increase production.  In funding these loans, KIVA investors are valuable partners in the effort and are much appreciated. We look forward to providing a follow up report on the progress of these women!

Meet Sibilina, a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past two years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes she has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents.\r\n<p>\r\nSibilina lives near Kapsowar in the Kapsumai area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Kapsumai area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Sibilina intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between.\r\n<p>\r\nTo accomplish this, Sibilina is applying for a 65,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Sibilina sees herself established and running more than one posho mill.

Most people here are very hardworking, and they work in the fishing industry.\r\n\r\nThis is where Gina lives.  She's 47 years old and married, and has two children, 17 and 14.  One attends the university and the younger one is in high school.  Her husband's a fisherman.\r\n\r\nGina has a fishing business; she fishes and sells fish.  She has two boats, each one with a crew of two or three people.  They earn a good percentage of the fish, going out on the high sea alongside a fishing boat that her husband crews.  They deliver the fish to that boat and receive their pay.  They go out for 20 or 25 days in a row, then return home.  She has had her boats for 11 years and it's going very well for her.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy nets, line, hooks, lures, fuel, and food for the fishing days.\r\n\r\nShe has been with the communal bank for more than 11 years and she likes it because the loans are a big help to her.

Sin embargo, en busca de mejores oportunidades y para poder sacar a su familia adelante, siendo muy joven, El\u00edas tuvo que abandonar su pueblo y dedicarse a la construcci\u00f3n en el puerto de L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas.  Al pasar de los a\u00f1os y ante la a\u00f1oranza del cari\u00f1o de sus padres, hace poco decidi\u00f3 regresar a Patamban su pueblo natal en la \u201cSierra Pur\u00e9pecha\u201d con el prop\u00f3sito de acompa\u00f1ar y cuidar a sus pap\u00e1s, adem\u00e1s de dedicarse a cultivar las tierras que tuvo que abandonar de joven. Por ello esta requiriendo de apoyo econ\u00f3mico, para equipamiento y adquisici\u00f3n de insumos para el establecimiento de 29,040 pinos productores de resina.\n\n Su sue\u00f1o es lograr que sus pap\u00e1s a pesar de tener m\u00e1s de los 80 a\u00f1os de edad, vuelvan a ver sus tierras con bosque, como cuando El\u00edas era ni\u00f1o y que la vida les permita ver el fruto de las plantaciones de resina, en los huertos nuevos que va a establecer.\n\nEl\u00edas siempre ha estado buscando una oportunidad como \u00e9sta y agradece la confianza que se le ha dado para lograr su sue\u00f1o, ya que est\u00e1 seguro de que habr\u00e1n buenos resultados, puesto que su mayor orgullo es tener la fortaleza para cumplir todos los objetivos que se propone. Por lo que piensa que solo se sentir\u00e1 orgulloso hasta que logre la cosecha de estas nuevas huertas de pinos. Su mayor reto ahora es llevar las plantaciones con \u00e9xito a la cosecha. Lo que le requerir\u00e1 de mucha paciencia y trabajo por m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os.\n\nEl\u00edas desea lograr una buena producci\u00f3n de resina y piensa que si todos se imaginaran que un \u00e1rbol puede dar resina por m\u00e1s de ochenta a\u00f1os, habr\u00eda m\u00e1s \u00e1rboles en el mundo, se dejar\u00eda de cortar tanta madera y se ganar\u00eda mucho m\u00e1s sin da\u00f1ar a la naturaleza.\n\n","en":"To find out more about how Ejido Verde is working to create opportunity for indigenous populations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SM2xd2GyDH8&feature=youtu.be\">watch this video<\/a>\n\nEl\u00edas is a native Purepecha from the indigenous community of Patamban.  He has two adult children.  Both of them have university degrees and are professionals.  El\u00edas\u2019s grandfather and father were resin extractors.  As a child, El\u00edas also worked with resin.  \n\nHowever, in seeking better opportunities, and in order to be able to get ahead, El\u00edas had to abandon his village when he was very young.  He worked in construction in the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas port.  As the years passed, he yearned for his parents\u2019 affection.  After a short while he decided to return to Patamban, his native village in the \u201cSierra Pur\u00e9pecha\u201d.  He did this in order to keep his parents company and to take care of them.  He also did it in order to cultivate the land that he had to abandon when he was young.\n\nThis is why he needs financial support for equipment and supplies to establish 29,040 pines that produce resin. His dream is to manage for his parents, in spite of being over 80 years old, to once again see their land with woods, just like when El\u00edas was a boy.  His dream is for life to allow them to see the end result of planting resin producing trees in the new groves that he will establish.\n\nEl\u00edas has always looked for an opportunity like this.  He is grateful for the trust that has been given to him in order to accomplish his dream.  He is sure that there will be good results.  This is because his greatest pride is having the strength to meet all of his proposed goals.  Therefore, he will only feel proud when he obtains the harvest from these new pine groves.\n\nHis biggest challenge now is successfully harvesting the resin.  This will require much patience from him and work for more than ten years.\n\nEl\u00edas wishes to get a good resin production.  He thinks that if everyone realized that a tree is able to produce resin for over 80 years, there would be more trees in the world.  They would stop cutting down so much wood, and they would earn a lot more without damaging nature.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":26750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1695892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Flexible Credit Study","Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"To buy and plant resin producing pine trees \u2013 the resin will be harvested annually, providing income for many years.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Patamban","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":376,"posted_date":"2014-10-14T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-13T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":26750,"lender_count":822,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"El\u00edas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mois\u00e9s ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salvador ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":26730,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":144,"loan_amount":26750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2024-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12830.4},{"due_date":"2025-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12830.4},{"due_date":"2026-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1069.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2024-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12840},{"due_date":"2025-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12840},{"due_date":"2026-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1070}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T14:20:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":773119,"name":"Keri Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ver\u00f3nica tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad y es l\u00edder de un grupo de ind\u00edgenas formado por cuatro mujeres y nueve hombres en la Comunidad  de Cher\u00e1n Atzicur\u00edn, en el Estado de Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, de donde es nativa.

She is married to Reynato, her business partner, and has two children. She manages their household while operating a business. They work hard to provide income for their everyday expenses. Lucresia owns and oversees operation of her jeepney service.\r\n\r\nShe has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) of jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, the jeepneys are constantly packed with passengers. Jeepneys offer one of the cheapest ways of getting somewhere. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the second World War and are still to be seen throughout the Philippines, in many colors and all over the place. \r\n\r\nOriginally, jeepneys were old American jeeps. They were used in the war against the Japanese army who occupied the Philippines for several years. After the Japanese army was defeated and the American military mission was completed, the jeeps were left by the tens of thousands on the islands in the Philippines.The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. Jeepney transport service is one of the stable businesses in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Lucresia is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan which she will use for repairs and maintenance of her jeepney. It is very important that her unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. Her husband drives it, so she is assured that her jeepney is well taken care of. Her earnings from their service is their means of living.  She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nLucresia hopes that their transport service will continue to be successful. She dreams for her children to get the best education. She prays for the safety of her husband in driving and for a better future for all of them. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1711164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

She directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators. \r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Eufemia is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Eufemia is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.  She looks forward for your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay their house rental.\r\n\r\nEufemia only dreams to have sufficiency in their daily needs particularly in the education of her children. She wants them to have a good life in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1711156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for their house rental.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-14T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-13T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2610.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625558},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3915.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535702},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2610.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134049},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2610.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756816},{"amount":58.32,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2610.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624199999},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1305.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186338}],"funded_date":"2014-10-14T23:38:49Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":778274,"name":"Marco Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marco es un joven emprendedor, soltero, trabaja brindando servicio de atenci\u00f3n al cliente en un grifo de su ciudad natal, Nazca.

He lives in Silang Cavite, Philippines with his wife and two children. He has been in the service for two years through the aid of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nMarlon works as a Garment Manufacturing Supervisor.  He directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators. \r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Marlon, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Marlon is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to any loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. He looks forward to your positive response, and any help from you will surely be of great help. He will use the loan to redeem the ATM card that he pawned, and also to pay other debt and expenses, especially the education of his children.\r\n\r\nMarlon wants to be successful someday. He desires to become a General Manager or a Pastor. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1711170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To redeem his pawned ATM card and pay for their other expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-14T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-13T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":12500.01,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12584.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625561},{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":12500.01,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12584.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535705},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8389.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134052},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8389.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756819},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.3,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8389.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200002}],"funded_date":"2014-10-17T12:51:30Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":778719,"name":"Frankis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Frankis de 42 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la fabricacion de bateas, recipiente de cemento que sirve para el lavado manual de ropa, a las familias.

is Estella. She is 50 years old and resides with her family in Cavite, Philippines. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for years, and she profits well from this. She also operates a jeepney for her additional income. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Estella would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 15,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Estella hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1711206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She earns a minimum of Php 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRita hopes to sustain their everyday needs. She plans to have her house renovated, and she wants to expand her store soon. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He is grateful he was previously granted a 50,000 PHP loan which he used for the maintenance of his tricycle unit. He works hard to continually provide income to meet their family\u2019s daily personal and household needs. \r\n\r\nRonel now also operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHPs-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan which he will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, corn rice, charcoal, sugar, cooking oil, and beverages. He is positive this will boost his income as he expands his business. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to him.\r\n\r\nRonel aims to grow his business to give his family a bright future. He wants to give his children the best education possible. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, and this is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

While she was in search of a job, she got a job as a runway model in town. However, she did not get the proper work and pay because models are not in demand in a small town. The job was not satisfactory so she went for the cabin crew interview held in town and was selected. She was overjoyed with the news but sad at the same time because she did not have money to pay for the refundable security deposit. Her friend who is taking the same loan introduced the WSDS education loan to her and she approached WSDS for financial assistance. With the loan, she will pay the refundable security deposit and join the cabin crew training. She has high hopes for her future endeavor to support her family in financial matters. She expressed her immense gratitude towards WSDS for saving her from financial insecurities.

As an alternative way to increase her income, Rosa started a business, but before that she provided hairdressing services. She is still doing this, but has decided to boost her income by opening a store. In her store she sells groceries, mostly for cash, but sometimes she offers short-term credit. Her main customers are her neighbors and friends from her neighborhood and surrounding areas.

With this investment she will respond effectively to the orders that her customers have placed, and thus her Kiva loan will substantially improve her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":597.6,"image":{"id":1707046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

This is where the members of the Credit Group Metropolitana meet up every two weeks. This is a group of people, who decided to join some time ago and form this Communal Bank, which has been very useful because with the loans they have been able to improve their small businesses. They work in different jobs, such as agriculture, commerce, services, among others. One of the members is Ana. She is 40 years old, married, and has two children, who are 15 and 11 years old, and who go to school. Her husband is a mechanic. As a good wife, Ana is requesting the loan to help her husband, who has a car repair shop where they do different jobs such as repairing motors, welding, painting and many more jobs for any type of vehicle. He works with the help of an assistant. He works in his shop, and at times he drives to other places if his customers need so. He also sells oils, grease and many spare parts that he needs for his jobs. Ana's husband has worked in this job for more than 30 years, and with it he supports his family. She will use this loan to buy oils, spare parts and replacement parts that her husband needs for his jobs. This is her first loan cycle in the Credit Group and she likes it because the loans are fast. Her dream is to give her family all the best. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5900,"image":{"id":1707121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy oils, replacement parts and spare parts.

","en":"Thanks to the previous loan received from Kiva, Sergei has put good heating in his greenhouses and has been able to increase his profits this year.

It has served them well because with the loans they have improved their small businesses and their lives.  They earn a living in a variety of jobs, including agriculture, general commerce, and service.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Karla, 21.  She's married and they have a one-and-a-half year old child.  Her husband's a soldier.\r\n\r\nKarla sells all types of clothing to earn some money.  She sells door-to-door as well as at home, where she receives her customers.  She works three or four days a week.  She goes out in the morning because it's easier to do her job at that hour.

He has been working in this field since 2009, although his experience dates from 28 years back when he began working in a region known as Barichara in Santander, where he labored in butcher shops and learned his trade.  He became independent 5 years ago and became a distributor of meat for a large region in the southwest of his city.  His future goal is to have his own shop and to provide university studies for his 16 year old child.  Currently Ramiro thinks it is the right time to invest.  December is approaching, and with it a lot of parties.  At these parties money rotates from hand to hand and it is important to strengthen businesses, which is what Ramiro wants to do via Kiva.  This will be his first loan, which he is requesting through Kiva partner Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

However, once she began a job with a company, she left the business for Emmanuel to look after so that he would have income of his own. Soon the business was growing and when he moved to another neighbourhood, he also moved the business and now runs it from his house. Now he employs someone to help him and his mother also helps at weekends.\r\n\r\nAs his business has grown, so has Emmanuel's desire to continue making progress. He has the challenge of completing his university courses and better equipping the restaurant. He is now applying for a Kiva loan, the first he has had with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

The lack of funds to achieve her goals is her major challenge so she has requested a loan from Kiva, the first loan she has had through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.
