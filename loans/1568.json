For a period of 10 years, she has provided her services of sewing women's national dresses. Abdusalom works with selling fish. He started this business a year ago, and he likes it very much.\r\n\r\nAbdusalom is a responsible and good man. He would like to help his nephew pay for his tuition. His nephew is a second year student at the Tajik Technical University. His yearly tuition is around 1,000 US dollar. His parents were only able to save up a little more than half of this sum. They are still missing 400 US dollar in order to be able to pay the full sum. \r\n\r\nWhen Abdusalom saw the difficult situation of his close relatives, he was not able to stand idly by. Therefore he applied for a loan to enable his nephew to continue his university education. He hopes for responsiveness and support from the Kiva lenders and promises to repay the loan on time through his business.

The meeting was attended by 5 members, the others member had a religious ceremony at the temple. During the meeting, they shared their experiences. They were able to manage the pigs well because they give them nutritious feed and vitamins. The Field Officer checks the pigs every month. They also make voluntary savings and give to the Field Officer to keep at MUK.\r\n\r\nNi Ketut has had a satisfactory result. Her pigs grow healthy and big. She sold them all to the big buyer. Now she has enough money to renovate her kitchen. She said many thanks to MUK, Kiva and Lenders to supporting her business. She plans to take another loan to increase her business.\r\n\r\nTo increase their population of pigs, the Piling Subur group decided to have another loan from MUK. This loan will be used to buy superior or local piglets, feed and also renovate the cages.\r\n\r\nNi Ketut will use her loan to purchase superior piglets for fattening.

Maral's farm currently has one horse and four sheep, and also a plot of land of 1.30 hectares. She grows barley for own use. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nMaral again turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase a horse with a foal. She plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, as she would like to save money for purchasing a yurt (a nomad dwelling structure) and set it up at the pasture during

This is his story:\n\n\"My name is Michael, a last-born in the family of seven siblings. \n\nI am a second year student in Strathmore University pursuing a degree in Business Information Technology. After completing my high school education, I stayed for five years without joining any tertiary institution due to financial constraints. Now KIVA is my only hope.\n\nA friend of mine informed me about Kiva loans and I took a step of doing the application. This loan is the only way out for me to complete my studies. At the moment, nobody in our entire family is in a position of meeting the fees needed and this is the main reason I decided to take the loan. \n\nI am specializing in IT and after graduation, I aim at coming up with my own software company. My hope is to be successful and to help those children who are financially disadvantaged to achieve their dreams. Many thanks to the Kiva Community for helping people like me achieve their dreams.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":112.48,"image":{"id":1702979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

mixed farming. She is a woman in her early thirties from a community not known for farming, but she has been earning well through agriculture. \r\n\r\nFor the past 5 years, her primary source of income has been milk, tea, and a variety of crops she plants. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit, and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \r\n\r\nIrene believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit. \r\n\r\nIrene awaits your

Therefore, Tazeem has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. With the help of this loan, Tazeem's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily and provide better transport facilities to earn the profitable income.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Her husband has been providing transportation services by driving a taxi for 20 years. He is responsible for fulfilling the needs of his entire family. Insafa's husband needs to perform maintenance on his taxi because the current condition of his taxi is poor, and it requires maintenance on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means, he is unable to perform maintenance on his taxi. Therefore Insafa has applied for a Kiva loan from its Field Partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Insafa's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily and provide better transportation services to earn a profitable income. Insafa also plans to build savings with the profit of her husband's income to meet her family's needs in the future. Insafa is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC

They are in their late 30's and early 40's and they all use charcoal for cooking. With traditional cook stoves, there is a lot of indoor air pollution which leads to respiratory diseases and also there is a lot of charcoal consumption by the traditional stoves.\n\nCurrently on average each member spends USD 1.3 on charcoal everyday. The loan will enable them purchase high efficient cook stoves JIKOKOA that will save them up to 50% of their daily consumption on charcoal.

She is pictured with her mother. She is the eldest among five and loved to take care of her younger siblings ever since childhood while her parents were away for work. All her siblings go to school. Her parents barely sustain the family with their inadequate income for paying the expenses of the household. There was never a time that I had peace of mind, said her mother. A blessing has showered upon our family this time, now that my eldest daughter is able to start working in a respectable profession. I am happy and hope that she will be able to support her younger siblings in the near future. She has been very supportive to her siblings and all of them were happy about her new job profile. \n\nMalemnganbi was selected as a flight attendant at an interview held in town. She had been very happy about the good news and shared it with her family and friends. In the midst of her good fortune, the one thing that could not assure her happiness was the large sum of money she had to pay for the refundable security deposit so that she could start her training as a cabin crew member in the aviation academy. Considering her family's financial condition, she was anxious about where she would get that amount of money. While she was in high tension and sharing about her financial insecurities, her friend, whose aunt is a member of Kiva, told her that through WSDS she could take an education loan. She shared the news with her mother and they were delighted about the news. There are always times when the family is going through ups and down due to the lack of finances.  \n\nShe will pay her security deposit with the loan she took from Kiva and join the training. She is very happy and thanks WSDS for providing the loan during her family's critical conditions. She will repay the loan with her salary when she starts earning. She wishes to continue supporting her family like she always did. She express her immense gratitude to all those generous lenders who are part of building her career and making it possible."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1701322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To pay the security deposit for a flight attendant training course.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-10-15T22:20:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-14T22:20:28Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malemnganbi Chanu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-17T15:54:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":782076,"name":"Thana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hieng's village takes water from wells and from the local streams.

Chinda's filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most users find the filter works from 3-5 years. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1710382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to purchase TerraClear water filters so they can have access to safe drinking water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Parksan District, Borlikhamxai Province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":393,"posted_date":"2014-10-15T22:20:29Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-14T22:20:28Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khamsai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maima","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vannaphone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thongsoon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noonchun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vixien","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vongthong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounmee","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Keomor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Pongsavanh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Noy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LAK","disbursal_amount":9400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1005874.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561804025},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1005874.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579772260},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-25T11:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1005874.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":597066548},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2011748.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611965580},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1005874.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637757906},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1005874.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649742408},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1005874.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665232078},{"amount":6.25,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50293.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681538592},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":1350000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1357930.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":698012206}],"funded_date":"2014-10-17T13:52:39Z","paid_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":781183,"name":"Aviito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aviito is forty years old, happily married and blessed with four children.

Thanks to her farm, she sells milk, macun (Armenian national dairy-product), meat and eggs. Her plot of land also brings her profit, since she cultivates on it and sells potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and greens. Ruzanna says that she is happy with her farming, and all her family members help her greatly; her husband helps in agricultural occupations, and her sons help her in the care of farm cattle. Now Ruzanna has plans to enlarge the number of her cattle.\r\n\r\nThis loan, in an amount of 600,000 Armenian drams, will help her to buy a cow and two bulls.

dirty and unsuitable for drinking without treatment. The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. Thong is excited that he, like his group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. Even though some people in the village, including Thong, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. Thong and other filter users also decrease the amount of money spent to boil water by purchasing less charcoal or wood and decreasing the time spent foraging for firewood. Thong's filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most users find the filter works from 3-5 years.

Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter.   The filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. The water filter also increases disposable income to users like Thongkan due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal, by decreasing time spent foraging for wood, and decreasing  the amount of money used to  purchase bottled water.

This is in preparation for the rain onset, which will usher in a new season of crop production. She is in need of a loan since farming inputs are very expensive. Farmers' crop income does not come on the regular. They have to wait for an entire season for their harvest in order to generate income. Abundance of harvest is not guaranteed because of the countless factors and uncertainties presented by both the internal and the external environment. Such loans as the one Jackline is seeking help farmers to afford input costs for the next season without having to forego some of their family's basic necessities. \r\n\r\nWhen asked how this loan will impact her life, she replied, \"It will expand my cereals business and elevate my family's livelihood.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1712011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

revenue, and employs approximately 70% of Kenyans. Despite the importance of agriculture to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain underserved by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers. \r\n\r\nMeet Nancy, an ever-smiling, hardworking and honest mother who is 28 years of age! She hails from the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. She is the proud mother of 3 lovely, school-going children. She loves and treasures her children and will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. \r\n\r\nNancy\u2019s primary source of income has come from selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming. Through these ventures she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for 10 years, and throughout she has never regretted going into farming. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mum has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses\". She faces financial challenges, and because the Nandi Hills area has proven a ready market for cereals, she is kindly seeking a loan to buy cereal for re-sale and thus improve her income. \r\n\r\nNancy\u2019s upbringing was challenging, and she has faced many economic problems. But this ever-smiling mum has been making great improvements, and she believes that through your loan she will be able to realize her goal of improving her living conditions and transforming her life. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, Nancy has received training and proven to be honest and disciplined with finances. She intends to fully repay the loan with the profits from her business.\r\n\r\nNancy is quite visionary and - with her accumulated profits - hopes she will be able to open a large cereal selling shop that will boost her income and completely turn her life around.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":495.06,"image":{"id":1712002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural

She is 64 years old and lives with her husband in the Nandihills area of Kenya. She is blessed with seven children who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide for them a better future. \r\n\r\nGladys was unable to study to have a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Gladys always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d \r\n\r\nBecause of how much she likes farming she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cKijana \u201d which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows, which produce between 10-15 liters a day; this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nKarimi also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to puchase high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nGladys is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production over the previous year.

She makes a living by baking pastries, an activity which constitutes her family's main source of income and which she learned when she was young, by helping her mother-in-law.  Narzinisa started her own business in 1996 and she has developed it since then.  She has a tandoor oven, some tables, and she uses coal, as opposed to wood, as she cares about the environment.  She currently makes a monthly income of 16,000 som (KGS).  She sells her pastries herself at the local market and they are so hot and delicious that she receives a high demand for them from regular customers.  Narzinisa also owns one cow and eight sheep.  She has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) which will allow her to buy flour and coal for baking.

He will purchase the needed things with the help of the loan. Zareena is feeling happy that she will be able to help her son with the loan. She is thankful to Kiva lenders and to BRAC Pakistan.

However, the demand is overwhelming and she wants to increase her poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds.

Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high.

Meet Maria, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandi hills area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley escarpment. \r\n\r\nMaria, 27, has been farming for the past eight years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nMaria is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nKenya's Nandi hills area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Maria could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Maria, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nMaria believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Maria to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1712069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-16T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-15T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.61,"local_amount":3609.57,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3620.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625274},{"amount":17.47,"local_amount":1552.93,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1557.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194431},{"amount":35.53,"local_amount":3157.97,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3167.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262252},{"amount":37.43,"local_amount":3326.76,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3336.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600553},{"amount":39.08,"local_amount":3599.08,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3609.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.41,"payment_id":681377406},{"amount":39.35,"local_amount":3758.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3769.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.93,"payment_id":711505417},{"amount":10.7,"local_amount":995.31,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":998.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.49,"payment_id":752110545}],"funded_date":"2014-10-16T05:52:50Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":782182,"name":"Joweria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joweria is a married  mother of five children, and two of them go to school.

Nelly practices mixed farming. That is, she grows tea and keeps dairy cows and, through these, she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed her cow \u201cLelmet.\" She really enjoys taking care of her animals. \r\n\r\nAlthough Nelly has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious woman. Her farm has not been producing as much harvest because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan of  30,000 KES to be able to buy farm implements. Through the loan, Nelly will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate to more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, Nelly will reap more, which will assure her of comfortably taking care of her family and repaying the loan.

future of her two daughters. She runs a two-acre farm by keeping dairy cattle and poultry, and growing tea and vegetables. She has been doing this for four years, but her income is still not sufficient to meet her family's basic needs. This forced her to diversify her interest into personal businesses that fall in and out of season. \r\n\r\nShe realised that she can make more money by placing more focus on dairy farming. How can she produce more milk for sale without having to purchase more cows that will only strain the available resources? Well, one way is by improving the nutrition and health of her animals. \r\n\r\nChristine is applying for a loan to purchase a chaff cutter. This machine will reduce hay strands into small, evenly-cut chaff that are easily ingestible and digestible. Chaffed hay can also be easily mixed by other feeds to ensure the cow gets a desirable ratio because no chance is left for the animal to select. \r\n\r\nAdditional income from this investment will enable Christine to comfortably meet her farm input costs that are quickly becoming prohibitive. Her family will also be positively impacted. When asked about the impact of the loan on her family, she replied, \"The chaffed hay will help increase the amount of feed my cows take. This will boost their productivity. My family will get enough milk for consumption and surplus will be sold.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1712162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Her business idea began four years ago, when her aunt affiliated with various organizations that sell through catalogs and managed to fill her with enthusiasm to do the same thing.  Thus began her independent work, and today she not only sells via credit but also with cash.  She sells every day from 5:00 in the evening to 8:30 at night.  She makes her purchases with cash and hopes that there will be products with special discounts so that she can take them back to her customers and always offer them the best at a good price.  \r\n\r\nHer goal is to support the professionalization of her sister and to move up in her business in order to support the strengthening of her family, which is made up of her spouse and three-year-old son.  Right now she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first funding that she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy women's clothing, footwear, and accessories.  With this investment, she will have more liquidity to invest in and reduce her sales costs, which would make this loan a successful investment and would positively impact the performance of this business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1706959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy women's clothing, footwear, and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-10-16T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-15T13:50:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":83.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88442},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":94245},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97073},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":99985},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":102984},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":106074},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109256},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":112534},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115910},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123497}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.22,"local_amount":88442,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":89011.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562431030},{"amount":43.38,"local_amount":94245,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":94852.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.74,"payment_id":579566750},{"amount":44.3,"local_amount":97073,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":97698.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.24,"payment_id":595164268},{"amount":45.53,"local_amount":99985,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100629.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.46,"payment_id":611789173},{"amount":92.33,"local_amount":209058,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":210404.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.2,"payment_id":636603460},{"amount":151.77,"local_amount":408934,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":411568.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":52.7,"payment_id":696560459},{"amount":19.92,"local_amount":52263,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52599.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.21,"payment_id":730994844}],"funded_date":"2014-10-21T17:15:34Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Sawyer","image":1559443}},{"id":782266,"name":"Ma.

She faces various market-related challenges but that alone is not going to stop her from doing poultry farming.\r\n\r\nDorcas is seeking a loan to purchase poultry and farm implements. The new acquisition of poultry will give her more eggs for selling and for hatching. Male chicks and hens that grow old and become less productive will be sold for meat. The old worn out tools in her farm will be replaced with modern, well-designed tools that are more effective and efficient. \r\n\r\nShe is going to use the returns from this investment to manage other business related expenses. By plowing profits back into the business, she will help it get off the ground. However, the biggest benefit of this loan, according to Dorcas, is that it will put food on the table for her children.

He was impressed by the already existing impact on sanitation which is a result of the franchise's existence in other areas. He now seeks a loan to help him purchase and run two Fresh Life toilets to be set up in a highly populated market area.

In the past eight years, she has bred more than five dairy cows, developed her farm, and planted and sold a variety of crop. She says the secret to her success is  thinking of farming as a way to make money, not just as a traditional way of life \u2013 adopting new technologies and methods, crop diversification, record-keeping and good planning also help. \r\n\r\nSarah was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming. Sarah always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming; it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much she likes farming she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cBoxy\u201d which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows.. \r\n\r\nThrough her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. Sarah also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. \r\n\r\nModern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. Sarah is visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Sarah believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her child a solid educational background. This loan will be Sarah\u2019s way out of poverty."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1712203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She started a sari-sari (mini- grocery) store with a capital of 3,000 PHP.  Her primary customers are their neighbors. Successfully, she was able to manage it well, and is able to finance the daily needs of her family with the help of Paglaum Cooperative, which she became a member last May 2008. \r\n\r\nRosario was able to avail herself of three loans and repaid them religiously.

She is a resident of Pendren village, which is around 150 kilometers from the district headquarters Nuapada of Odisha, India. Tarulata is twenty-four years old and is sitting with a raised hand in the photo. She is a married woman with one daughter. Her husband is a vegetable cultivator. \r\n\r\nThe primary work of Tarulata\u2019s family is farming, from which they get a low return, which makes it very difficult to maintain the family. So, she thought about an additional income source and started a milk business to earn some extra income. For the last six years, she has been doing this business. \r\n\r\nNow, she has two cows producing six liters of milk per day. She earns a monthly income of 6,000 INR, which is not sufficient to fulfill her dream. Therefore, she, along with eleven other women of her village, formed the group and availed themselves of a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nFrom her loan of 12,000 INR, Tarulata will purchase another cow to enhance her milk business, and purchase seeds, fertilizer, etc. for the vegetable cultivation. She is very hopeful that this investment will support her to earn some extra income and help her to save money for better education of her child and construction of a good house.\r\n\r\nOut of the other eleven members of the group, six members are vegetable cultivators, four members sell milk, and two members manage a general store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1712358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase another cow to enhance her milk business, and purchase seeds, fertilizer, etc. for the vegetable cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"PENDREN,SINAPALI, NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-10-16T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-15T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aeni       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basamati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fulamati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karun ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nile ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Nilendri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rukmini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tarulata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":144000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":144000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-18T18:23:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":777275,"name":"Ana Gabriela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 18 a\u00f1os de edad Gabriela es madre soltera, tiene un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os al que ama mucho, comenta que estaba estudiando y desde que tubo a su hijo se sali\u00f3 del colegio, en la actualidad se dedica a cuidar a su ni\u00f1o y   para tener dinero para los gastos de \u00e9l se dedica a la crianza de animales menores, el cr\u00e9dito lo va a invertir en la compra de pollos para ponerlos en un peque\u00f1o galp\u00f3n, lo que Gabriela anhela  es mejorar su negocio para tener mas ingresos y velar por el  bienestar de su hijo sobre todo que su hijo este sano de salud.","en":"At 18 years old, Gabriela is a single mother and has a 2-year-old son that she loves very much.
