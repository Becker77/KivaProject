He\u2019s also faced challenges sourcing inputs and raw materials, which has led him to developing his own designs and solutions.\r\n\r\nAndrew\u2019s approach to business is characterized by facing difficulties head-on.

Jeniffer also owns a dairy cow.\n\nShe is happily married, and has four children that depend on her for the basic needs. For the past 12 years, she has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her sources of income are milk selling, eggs selling, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d She sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and, because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound and the demand has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand, she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. \n\nThrough the loan she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity and hence satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used to improve her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from poultry manure which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make her business flourish, and hence provide a secure solid education system to her

They are determined to eliminate poverty, empower themselves, and create more prosperous lives for themselves and their families. \r\n\r\nAna is a 30-year-old member of the Trust Bank group and about to begin her first loan cycle. She is both nervous and excited about this big step that she is about to take. She is focused on increasing her income to provide the basic necessities for her two children and help them to receive an education. Ana sells sandals in a variety of sizes, colors, and designs. She is requesting a loan to purchase more inventory as her business is becoming increasingly popular. Ana travels three times each week to different nearby markets in order to increase sales.\r\n\r\nShe is a good example of a hardworking woman who has established a small business with much effort and sacrifice and is beginning to realize some benefits.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the financial capital that the women of the Trust Bank \u201cVirgen de Concepci\u00f3n receive, they also participate in monthly educational trainings at their meetings. A Friendship Bridge Trust Bank Officer facilitates these trainings and topics like self-esteem and empowerment, decision making and leadership as well as children\u2019s education are discussed. The ladies also learn how to manage their small loans with information about effective business practices. Additional subjects include hygiene, health and the use of medicinal plants. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank thank KIVA investors for their valuable and much-appreciated support. This is a special opportunity for them as they cannot simply walk into a bank and request a loan. KIVA investors are wonderful partners in this effort!

and was derived from the forested landscape of the area. The Quich\u00e9s have left one of the few indigenous documents to describe their history before the Conquest. The \u201cPopol Vuh\u201d, the sacred book of the Quich\u00e9 nation, was written in the Quich\u00e9 language using the Roman alphabet a few years after the Conquest. It tells of the creation of the world and of the wanderings of the ancestors of these proud people. It is reminiscent of the Christian Bible. Quich\u00e9 or Santa Cruz del Quich\u00e9 is the name given to a busy and populated municipality in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. \r\n\r\nWith a desire to create and sustain or grow their small businesses, nine women have gathered together in Quich\u00e9 to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLos Celajes\u201d. Their ultimate goals are to join with their husbands to generate enough income to support their families and see their children complete their formal education. Their businesses include commercial sales of clothing, cosmetics, sausages, and snacks. \r\n\r\nOtilia is 52 years old and leader of the Trust Bank group. She is single and has one son. Otilia has two businesses that she started a few years ago: the sale of snacks and the fabrication and sale of aprons. She is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge to add an additional business - the purchase of clothing in bulk for resale. She also wants to buy thread and fabric for her apron business, as well as ingredients for her snack sales.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of \u201cLos Celajes\u201d Trust Bank not only need financial capital in the form of loans but also new educational tools. They receive these new tools in the form of educational seminars at their monthly meetings. Some of the topics covered include nutrition, health and hygiene as well as the use of medicinal plants. The women also learn about self-esteem. They learn to manage their loans with information about business planning, budgeting, accounting, marketing and customer service. Friendship Bridge calls this valuable combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nKIVA investors are greatly valued by the women of the Trust Bank for their generosity and kindness in funding these much needed loans. We look forward to reporting on the progress of Otilia and her friends in the Trust Bank \u201cLos Celajes\u201d. Thank you, KIVA investors!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":1712433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Wayan has suggestions for group loans, the loan amount to be increased and the interest derived. She remains grateful for what she gets. The pig program has been shown to support family income. One member resigned because she moved to town with her family and was replaced by a new member.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sumber Bunga group's new loan of 15,000,000 IDR, each member receives 1,500,000 IDR. This loan will focus on purchasing superior piglets and feed.\r\nWith her loan, Wayan will purchase a sow.

She is 54 and the mother of five children. She has a large, close-knit family and lives with her husband, two sons, three daughters, and two daughters-in-law. Harmony and mutual respect prevail in Davlatmo's family, which is very important for them. Her husband is a construction worker and Davlatmo has devoted thirty years of her life to the high school where she teaches. She has not forgotten about her hobby and interest in sewing, either. She has been taking orders for traditional dresses from home for over three years. She is able to work at the school and at home. Now she is asking for help to buy a computerized sewing machine that will really help with her work. She cannot make the purchase on her own due to lack of money. Davlatmo hopes for your

He lives with his wife and their children. He always looks for ways to move his family forward. Despite being a modest person, he has known how to support his household financially.\r\n\r\nFor many years, he has made a living by growing a variety of grains and vegetables like corn, beans, millet, chayote squash, tomatoes, and cucumbers.

waterborne illness. TerraClear is a social enterprise with the mission to increase access to safe drinking water especially in remote households. Since 2010, TerraClear has been locally manufacturing ceramic water filters, which provide effective and long-term household access to clean water.\n\nTerraClear's success has been built on promoting an affordable and easy to use product with an innovative design. TerraClear became a Kiva Field partner at the beginning of the year in order to increase its outreach and provide these water filters to its end users. Ceramic Water Filters have helped over 30,000 families to access clean water in Laos. The next stage of TerraClear's business plan is to scale up production and delivery to more remote areas. To achieve this, Kiva has partnered with Nexus Carbon for Development to provide a loan of $35,000 to TerraClear to purchase a delivery truck to service remote households of Laos with safe drinking water.\n\nCurrently, TerraClear can only transport 30-35 water filters at one time. This new truck will allow TerraClear to transport 120-130 water filter sets, which will reduce the number of trips from the provinces back to the distribution center. This will dramatically increase the number of filters reaching households every week. \n\nAs TerraClear is scaling-up, this investment will require some time to produce returns. The loan has been structured with a single payment at the end of the loan term with the expectations that lenders could get paid back earlier if TerraClear produces results quicker than anticipated. \n\nPictures displayed in the profile show TerraClear's end users who have received water filters and a short video of TerraClear's founder.  \n\nFor more information about TerraClear and safe water in Laos, go to https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Nexus-c4d\/339349449574898?sk=info or www.laowater.org\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":35000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9000,"image":{"id":1713922,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2996,"youtubeId":"CZCLfGV_EuY","title":"Kiva Borrower Nathan from Lao People's Democratic Republic","thumbnailImageId":1708194},"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["SME"],"use":"to purchase a truck to deliver water filters to remote areas of Laos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Thakek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":431,"posted_date":"2014-10-16T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-15T22:20:06Z","loan_amount":35000,"lender_count":1138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Terraclear","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":35000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":9000,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-23T12:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":9000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649700181}],"funded_date":"2014-10-18T01:10:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":782636,"name":"Jamal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamal is a 30-year-old, married, father of two children.

Jennifer hails from Kapsowar, Kenya, an area that enjoys favorable weather patterns and this boosts crop production in the area. Jennifer -- being someone who is very ambitious and someone who always takes advantage of positive things -- would like to capitalize on the good weather patterns experienced in the region and boost her farming. \r\n\r\nBeing a hardworking mother, Jennifer has always ensured that she puts food on the table for her family. She also ensures that she is able to take her children to school. Jennifer detests living in conditions of poverty and she has a plan to improve her standard of living. This is why she is seeking a loan of 52,750 KES in order to be able to purchase a dairy cow. This will help in producing milk and manure to be used on her farm. \r\n\r\nMilk from the cow will be sold to the local market and this means improved cash flow. Through improved cash flow her profits will be higher and she can comfortably take care of her family and take her kids to school. Through your loan Jennifer will be empowered economically and be able to improve her standard of living and also those of people living within the area.

","en":"Muborak lives quietly and peacefully with her two children and their own families in northern Tajikistan.  She is a widow; her husband died a few years ago.  She has been cultivating wheat for more than eight years.  She grows wheat on two hectares of land.  She also makes an additional income from animal husbandry.

This lady has now become a passionate crusader and practical dairy farmer who went into farming early, when their area was still in the dark about modern ways of profitable dairy farming. For the past three years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk and some variety of crops she plants. \r\n\r\nProceeds from dairy farming have always not been enough to support her four children. Agnes loves to take care of her dairy animals and has even nicknamed one of them \u201cChelel,\u201d which makes her a very proud farmer. Agnes is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow so that she can fully utilize the space in her farm and so that she can seize the opportunity for the ready market of milk that is in her village. \r\n\r\nThrough increased profits Agnes will be able to comfortably provide for her children and will also be able to secure a future for her eventual grandchildren. Agnes is confident that if you invest in her, she will be able to turn around her life; and with the accumulated profits, she will be able to open a large milk shop that will sell to both wholesalers and retailers.

Her oldest daughter is now 29 years old and her youngest son is 11.  Almakan has a university education.  Since 2002, she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  Almakan has worked very hard to grow her business, and she now owns three cows, three calves and 10 sheep.  She also grows corn on 1.5 hectare of allotted land, for her family's own consumption.  She makes a monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS), which is vastly insufficient to support and educate her children, most of whom are still in school.  In order to further develop her farming activity, Almakan has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy calves.  She is planning to use her profits from this loan to further increase her livestock headcount, which will allow her to improve her welfare and to save some money toward her children's

Emmy comes from Kapsowar, where she lives with her parents. Emmy has been a mixed farmer for three years. Her primary income sources are eggs, crops and some small business she engages in to make the extra coin. \r\n\r\nEmmy is most passionate about horticulture farming. She takes pride in being a part of the fastest growing agriculture industry category in Kenya. However, she is facing serious challenges brought about by harsh weather conditions. \r\n\r\nEmmy is seeking a loan to invest in the expansion of her horticulture farm.

She makes an effort every day to advance alongside her family. It is for that reason that every weekend she gets up very early to cook corn, chicken and salsa to then prepare the tamales that she goes out to sell throughout the town and its surroundings.

Due to insufficient financial means he is unable to maintain his taxi. Therefore Farzana has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Farzana's husband can afford the maintenance costs easily.

is 42 years old, married, and has a daughter. All members of the family live in an IDP settlement. His wife is a housekeeper and raises their child. He is a farmer and grows seasonal fruits (apples, pears, cherries, etc.) and vegetables (cucumbers, greens, potatoes, tomatoes, and so on). He sells all of these products at a local bazaar and earns 180 AZN monthly. He has been working in this field for five years and has good experience in gardening.\r\n\r\nPeople like eating fresh fruits and vegetables because it is very good for their health. Beside that, people prepare different national dishes from vegetables and delicious sweet pies, cakes and jams from fruits. People prefer buying fruits and vegetables from Dayandur\u2019s grocery.

Meet Ruth, one of the most hardworking women on earth. She is 20 years of age, very hardworking and a go-getter.  She hails from Kipsana, a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin, but Ruth has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past three years. Her primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. Ruth passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cBrown\u201d, and whenever she is milking her cow, she feels proud. She is contented with the farming way of life. Ruth is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her parents of a decent meal. The Kapsowar area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. Being a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Ruth feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. Ruth is very disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children to come."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1712846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is 48 years old, married, and raising five children.  The local climate is ideal for the cultivation of crops as well as for animal husbandry.  Robiya has been raising livestock for more than two years, mostly fattening sheep.  She wants to grow her business, but doesn't have enough money to do so.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan of 5,000 somoni which will allow her to buy livestock and develop her business.  With the profits from her loan, she is planning to provide her children with a good education and modern technology.

Thanks to Erkaim's hard work, today her business contains 2 cows, 2 calves and 35 sheep. Erkaim is also involved in selling food products and commodity-type goods at her own retail pavilion. Erkaim's monthly income amounts to 9,000 som (KGS). Her husband and all of the children actively help with the household. The family tries to invest their savings into developing and expanding their business. Erkaim requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy calves and spend some of the money, 25,000 som (KGS) precisely, on increasing the goods turnover at the store.

raising 2 small children together with her husband. Nurgul has a higher education, but it is very hard to find a job in the village; however, it is necessary to support the family and raise the children. This is why Nurgul has been involved in agriculture for already 3 years. Today her business contains 1 cow, 30 sheep, 2 horses, and 90 prepared bales of hay. Nurgul's monthly income amounts to only 15,000-20,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Nurgul requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy sheep in order to increase the livestock headcount. Nurgul plans to invest the earnings from the loan to further increasing her livestock

Thus, Dinh and her husband are the ones who mainly generate income for the family. \r\n\r\nThey primarily work at agricultural production, such as cultivating rice, vegetables, raising chickens, pigs, and fish. Furthermore, Dinh's husband works for local construction employers. \r\n\r\nTo better cover their living expenses, Dinh has stepped up the business by raising more fish. For that reason, she continues to apply for the second loan with Entrepreneurs du Monde - Anh Chi Em and will use the loan to buy small fish. She said that she was really interested in the training sessions provided by the program and, hopefully, the training would make her business go well. \r\n\r\nDinh dreams that her family will be more

Zamira has received secondary education. Since 1992, Zamira has been raising livestock as an additional source of income for her family, having launched her business with 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Zamira\u2019s hard work, her farm now includes five cows, three calves and 20 sheep. On her 0.5 ha [1.2 acres] land plot she grows corn for own needs. She has stocked up on hay and feed for her livestock;  during summer, the animals are brought out to pasture. Zamira\u2019s monthly revenue is approximately 20,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Zamira has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy calves. She plans to invest the resulting revenue in an additional expansion of her business. She would also like to save up for building a house, for which she has already purchased a land

He is single, and he lives with his family in Irazola.\r\n\r\nHe has been a workman in a company in his city for some time now. His work performance is excellent because he has never been afraid of hard work, and with this, he has been able to support his family with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn his free time he likes to play sports; and when he feels worried, he likes to go to Pucallpa. In this way, he relaxes and returns with more energy for fulfilling his goals.\r\n\r\nEdson wants to repair his house, as the roof is currently constructed from some corrugated sheeting and coco palms.  \r\n\r\nHe is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because with the support that they have given him, he will be able to purchase materials such as cement, nails, and sand, in order to begin building a roof for his house. In this way, he will be able to live more securely.\r\n\r\nLater on, he hopes to purchase a plot of land in order to cultivate oil palms, and thus become a prosperous businessman.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1708458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase cement and nails in order to build a roof for his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Irazola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2014-10-17T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-16T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edson Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":155.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":169.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":176.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":184.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.83,"local_amount":150.93,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":153.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562397468},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":155.87,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":158.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579528452},{"amount":57.17,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-31T10:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":165.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595127808},{"amount":59.22,"local_amount":169.21,"processed_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T10:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":171.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610523283},{"amount":61.7,"local_amount":176.28,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-25T09:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":178.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624817396},{"amount":64.53,"local_amount":184.38,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-30T11:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":187.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636181564}],"funded_date":"2014-10-18T15:28:45Z","paid_date":"2015-04-30T11:02:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanora Brennan","image":null}},{"id":782875,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is a farmer in the town of Makueni, where she grows crops to sell.

The store wasn't as big and had fewer goods for sale then, but with each passing year, Dilbar did her best to grow her business and expand her offering, thereby strengthening her family's finances.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Dilbar needs to buy and ship in a new set of goods to increase the variety of her offering.  She is seeking a loan to that end, and hopes she'll get the help she needs to bring her plans to fruition.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1712177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy a shipment of new wares to increase the variety of her offering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vakhsh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.710833 68.831111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-10-17T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-16T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":45.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilbar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":172.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":178.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":186.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":186.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":202.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":206.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":211.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":215.71},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":226.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":231.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":243.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.18},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.27,"local_amount":172.7,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":181.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579638131},{"amount":37.46,"local_amount":178.39,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":187.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595214742},{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":186.54,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":195.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610610115},{"amount":38.2,"local_amount":186.23,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":195.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.91,"payment_id":624882161},{"amount":38.75,"local_amount":202.19,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":212.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.71,"payment_id":636348526},{"amount":37.91,"local_amount":206.53,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":216.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.46,"payment_id":649621059},{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":211.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":221.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.44,"payment_id":665101035},{"amount":39.75,"local_amount":215.71,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":226.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.55,"payment_id":681399148},{"amount":172.74,"local_amount":940.27,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":986.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.71,"payment_id":696609229}],"funded_date":"2014-10-31T00:41:48Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T15:23:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Hamel","image":null}},{"id":767457,"name":"Chantha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chanta resides in a rural area located in the Koh Sotin district of the Kampong Cham province, Cambodia.
