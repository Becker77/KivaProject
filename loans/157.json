It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After that time, they return to their homes for a week of rest before returning to the open sea.

Meet Lydia a simple country woman aged 26. She comes from a very hardworking family who works the land to earn their living. Thanks to the knowledge they have passed on to him, Lydia today raises and sells cows. She starts work in the early hours of the morning (5 a.m.) caring for and feeding the animals. She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past six years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet(motorcycle business). Lydia passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Lydia is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand.

Since 2001, she has operated a small business selling cosmetic products from her home. Five years ago, Sandra was given a small loan of US $50 by FINCA Peru, which she used to expand her product line and grow her business. She paid the loan back $5 per week, using a portion of the profits from her business.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more cloth for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130719},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130720},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027511},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613512},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010591}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T19:52:01Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":88471,"name":"Sorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Sorn L., 51, and his wife, Mrs. Yat Cheng, 48, who live in a small village in the suburbs of Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia, married in 1980 and have four children: one son and three daughters.

two children.  She is 37 years old, and went into business several years ago when her family income started to drop, and work on the collective farm could no longer cover all the family expenses. The children were growing and so she decided to find another source of income.  When Robiyahon started to trade at the market, she had very little working capital.  The gradual reinvestment of a portion of her profits into the company yielded even bigger profits. Also, not long ago her younger brother began to help her, and now he and his family are part of the business as well.

This is 30-year-old Joyce K. from Mbeya . She is married with four children between the ages of 2 and 10.\r\n\r\nJoyce has been running a genge business since 2008. A genge (grocery store) is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to, to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nJoyce works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week and currently earns about $120 a month. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase items in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":901462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773314}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T19:39:19Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113047,"name":"Samfien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A. is married to two wives and has six children.

Vasati has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1600 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Vasati is now requesting a new loan of $2200 WST, which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Vasati from SPBD.  Vasati plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The street where she lives isn't paved yet.  Four years ago Lorena began selling Yanbal (a brand of catalogue cosmetics) thanks to a girlfriend who encouraged her to do so in order to have a source of income for her family.  She works from 2pm until 6pm selling cosmetics and perfumes.  She buys $280 worth of cosmetics per month and she sells them for $400 per month.  Her 16-year-old daughter helps her sell.

They have four children, a 29-year-old, a 24-year-old, a 19-year-old and their youngest daughter, 16, who is in public secondary school.

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the Somono district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Mainouna left school in the third grade of elementary school (according to the Mali education system) in order to set up a small business at her mother's to sell sweetmeats. After several years' apprenticeship with her mother in order to master the mechanics of business, she ended up developing her own business selling millet and rice, which she has been carrying out now for seven years. She benefits from a large customer base and carries out her business on the market of Somono in the town of S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of increasing her working capital in order to make more profit, she resorted to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been in relations with this company for the past 48 months. After four group loans and two individual loans which have all been paid without incident, she is now on her third individual loan which she plans to use to buy 800kg of rice. She gets her supplies in the Office zone of Nigeria, more precisely in Dougabougou and S\u00e9ribala. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mainouna T. generally sells for cash to a customer base made up of both women and men. With this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 FCFA. This profit will allow her to help her husband and to contribute to social events (baptisms, marriages etc.). Her ambition is to have a piece of land to live on. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

C. is 46 years old and single. She has four children, two of whom are married. Her two younger children, both boys, are 18 and 13 years old. Her older son is finishing high school, where he studies Computer Science, and her younger son is a freshman in high school. Her partner, who she lives with, is a mechanic and sells bicycle parts to help support the family. For the past four years, Mrs. A. C. has owned a small local store located at Kilometer 104 of the Leon Chinandega highway, which is better known as Telica. This is her second source of income: she is a schoolteacher, but does not earn very much since her teacher's salary is so low. Since her partner doesn't earn very much as a mechanic, either, she decided to open the store to better support her children. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to inject more capital into her small store to offer a wider variety of merchandise for household consumption and to grow the store into one of the biggest in the area. With this loan, she plans to expand and strengthen her inventory by buying rice, sugar, oil, soda, detergent, cosmetics, chicken, eggs, milk and other products. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":210099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy rice, sugar, oil, etc. for local store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Telica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-10-06T18:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5316705},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935064},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858560},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399820},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091803},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985213},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445823},{"amount":281.26,"local_amount":5416.69,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5575.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956479}],"funded_date":"2008-10-06T19:57:52Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":72103,"name":"Anwar's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anwar baji is the wife of M. and lives in a city named Arifwala, Pakistan.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"\u201cAssociation Femme D\u00e9veloppement Entreprise AFDE Num\u00e9ro 15\u201d is composed of five women who average 38 years of age and who live in large traditional extended families in the Grand Thi\u00e8s district in the city of Thi\u00e8s, located 70 km from Dakar, the capital of Senegal.  They know one another through ties of community and kinship.  Some of them do food catering, and some sell cloth.  They learned how to cook when they were young, so they are very experience and in high demand in these businesses.  Women\u2019s clothing in West Africa is an essential part of the culture, and all women wear very colorful clothing.  Commerce in fabrics therefore does well.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith regard to improving the quality of their services and expanding their businesses, the members of this reliance group decided to join the micro-finance institution IMCEC.  They received a group loan before from IMCEC, and they indeed repaid it. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members plan to use this loan to replenish their stock of cloth and to bolster their restaurant business, accepting cash at the Grand Thi\u00e8s marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average profit of 30,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cloth and to strengthen their restaurant business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T23:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Codou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nogaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Codou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636070},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037980},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262084},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703068},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132654},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046923},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892472},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780980}],"funded_date":"2009-04-11T14:34:21Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104871,"name":"Eudosia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eudosia es socia del Banco Comunal Soluci\u00f3n.\nEudosia es conviviente, tiene 49 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, Eudosia tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes en general actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda de su hija.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T23:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":901462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773319}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T17:40:25Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113063,"name":"Las Productoras De Patahuasi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of the communal bank \u201cProductoras D.

He lives in a traditional extended family with several other families in the Darsalam neighborhood in S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\n\nMamadou abandoned his studies in the third grade of basic school (Malian educational system) for personal reasons. He then started to learn the tailoring trade alongside his uncle for three years.\n\nAfter this stage of his apprenticeship, during which he learned a great deal, he decided to branch out on his own; that was fourteen years ago now. He has a great reputation due to his genius for creating unique items.  In addition to his tailoring business, Mamadou Kon\u00e9 also occasionally sells grain.\n\nIn an effort to improve his business, he has turned to the loan program offered by the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is Mamadou's first individual loan, with which he intends to buy two 20U sewing machines.  He buys his supplies locally in S\u00e9gou. He makes the clothes and sells them for cash or credit to both men and women.\n\nWith this loan he hopes to generate a monthly income of 100,000 FCFA, which will allow him to take care of his expenses (e.g., food, clothing) and provide for the needs of his workshop.\n\nHis ambition is to get into commercial grain storage in S\u00e9gou.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent,

Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which was also funded by Kiva lenders, was used to fund the operations of her eatery and general store business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 16th loan, in the amount of 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use on her business.

Miriam is requesting a loan to buy ingredients like wheat, oil, eggs, yeast, and cinnamon, to bake bread. She also wishes to buy chickens to dress and sell in her community.  This so she can obtain income and advance her family.\r\n\r\nShe was motivated to carry out this activity to help her husband earning household income and, together, to make a contribution to their advancement, each one giving the best they could with their own activity. With the earnings obtained from her two businesses, she can buy all the necessities and not see herself limited in either of her activities, and she can have better income each day.

She is 29 years old. Marilyn is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Guava.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has 2 school-aged children. She owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, instant noddles, canned goods, coffee, milk, and toothpaste in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,200 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Marilyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Monthly, Salvacion earns approximately Php 9,500.\r\n\r\nTo help her advance her business, Salvacion is applying for a loan amounting to Php 19,000. She will buy more quick-selling items such as toiletries, canned goods, and instant noodles to add to her inventory of products. She sees this as a sure way to increase her profits over time.\r\n\r\nSalvacion simply dreams of getting away from poverty and giving her family a prosperous life. She desires that as her business grows with the application of every entrepreneurial skill and the spiritual support CCT gives her, every member of her family will experience not only happiness, but joy that transcends all circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been in this business for the last three months and says that it is profitable. The major challenge Alice faces is financial constraints.

Meet Everlyne, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Kitale area of Kenya. Everlyne, 30, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through those years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Everlyne is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. She is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kitale area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Everlyne could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Everlyne, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Everlyne believes that this loan will be of great help to her. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Everlyne to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.\nShe hopes to be able to make progress as a smallholder farmer and to have a more stable income.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2046874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2463,"name":"Amparo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p> Ampara and her husband have a workshop where they make and sell gates, fences and other metalwork.

Nyoman Kartikayasa","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Breeding Kereman cows (cows that are raised in the barn) is very popular at Jembrana district, west of Bali. Besides saving man-power, it's also more efficient. We can raise Kereman cows faster so that we can sell it in 4 to 6 months. Therefore, I Nyoman Kartikayasa used the loan from Dinari to buy 1 cow (2-3 years old) which cost Rp. 3,500,000 (about $386). The rest of the loan was used to cover the cow's food expense. I Nyoman Kartikayasa feeds the cow twice a day in the morning and in the evening. The basic food is processed food made from the mixture of rice chaff, corn and ground soyabean dregs. The estimated cow's food per kg is Rp. 1,500 (about $0.16) (Rp.1,500 x 120 days = Rp. 180,000 -- about $20). This processed cow's food is given every morning. In the afternoon, he feeds the cow with natural food such as grass, jackfruit leaves, and cocoa skin which contained good protein for cow. When the harvest time comes, the cow's weight was 415 kg and its price is Rp. 15,000 (about $1.65) per kg. Hence, the net income (after subtracted with the initial capital and cow's food expense) was Rp. 2,545,000 (about $281). I Nyoman Kartikayasa is very pleased with this business. He hopes to get more loans from Dinari so that he can raise more cows. He can use the income to cover his family's daily expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDi Kabupaten Jembrana, Bali Barat,  pemeliharaan sapi Kereman ( sapi yang dikandangkan ) sangat diminati oleh masyarakat . Selain menghemat tenaga, juga lebih efisien. Dengan adanya sapi kereman yang pemeliharaannya cepat, jangka waktu 4 - 6 bulan sudah siap untuk dijual. Oleh sebab itu lewat Dinari, I Nyoman Kartikayasa memperoleh modal pinjaman Modal ini dipergunakan untuk membeli 1 ekor sapi yang sudah cukup besar ( umur 2 \u2013 3 tahun ) dengan harga Rp. 3.500.000,-. Sisanya dipakai untuk biaya pakan.. Sapi kereman I Nyoman Kartikayasa diberi makan 2 kali setiap pagi dan sore hari. Makanan pokoknya makanan olahan ( konsentrat ) yang terbuat dari dedak padi yang kasar, jagung, ampas kedelai yang dihaluskan kemudian dicampur menjadi satu. Perkiraan harga pakan per kilogram adalah Rp.1.500,- ( Rp. 1.500.- X 120 hari = Rp. 180.000.- )\r\nPakan olahan diberikan pada pagi hari dan untuk siang hari diberi makanan alami sebagai makanan tambahan seperti rumput, daun nangka dan kulit coklat ( kakao ) yang proteinnya bagus untuk sapi. \r\nPada saat panen berat sapi I Nyoman Kartikayasa 415 kg dengan harga per kg Rp.15,000,-. Jadi pendapatan bersih setelah dipotong modal sapi dan pakan yang menjadi Rp. 2.545.000,- selama empat bulan. I Nyoman Kartikayasa sangat senang dengan usahanya ini . Harapannya supaya pinjaman dari Dinari bisa meningkat agar bisa pelihara lebih dari 1 ekor. Dengan keuntungan ini bisa dipakai untuk keperluan rumah tangganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":80277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He hopes to finish the project as soon as possible with, of course, your help.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":257041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Build addition to house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nuevo Laredo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"27.5 -99.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T00:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lazaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.39,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":841.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14859485},{"amount":60.47,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":842.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400903},{"amount":60.39,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":841.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092997},{"amount":60.39,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":841.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35986452},{"amount":60.47,"local_amount":834,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":842.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44447157},{"amount":60.39,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":841.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52957949},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1684.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73601007},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":842.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87037155},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":842.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96949677},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":833.34,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":842.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103791846},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":842.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110682580}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T02:20:09Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:37:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":88503,"name":"Vivian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vivian is married with six children and lives in Ntabesi, a quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon.  Vivian plans to invest her loan in her already existing provision. She will divide her loan between articles such as rice, savon, sugar, magi, palm oil and transportation costs.  She plans to contribute 50,000 CFA (approximately $100 USD) of her own savings towards her business plans.  \r\n \r\nThis is Vivian\u2019s second loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2007.  From her past experience, her articles are in high demand in her area and she can sell it quite quickly with fast turnover.  Bringing palm oil and other articles from the main market to her community will reduce the transportation costs of her clients as they will be able to purchase these items nearby.  She is confident that this loan will allow her to provide more products and therefore sell more as she will buy in bulk.  \r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Vivian hopes to expand her business.  She also plans to support her children, improve their education, and improve her family\u2019s living standards.  She knows she will not have a problem with her repayments because her loan schedule is set up so that her payments are small and regular.  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-17T00:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Queen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":701137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773322}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T06:56:14Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113079,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita J. is from the town of Lopez Jaena.

Because she is the oldest daughter, she feels a duty to take care of her parents.  During the day, she sells Internet services and during the evening, cosmetics.  She sells cosmetics from a catalog to her friends and neighbors and they pay her weekly.  The revenue from the business is her motivation for continuing it.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Maysoon wants to improve her house by painting, changing tiles, windows and doors, etc.  She needs to take a loan from FATEN.  When Maysoon gets the loan, she will be able to pay for making these improvements to her house.  This will enable her to live with the family in healthy and better conditions. Maysoon is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead of her.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Represented by group leader Jacqueline D., the group describes their business activities as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  Effock is a village in reconstruction after having experienced more than ten years under the fire of war with the [separatist conflict] crisis in Casamance.  Being in reconstruction, we need financial support which will help us manage our enterprises properly in order to better face this new phase that we are beginning. <p>\r\n\r\nPurpose of the loan:  To combat migration from rural areas, reconstruct our village, and improve the living conditions of its inhabitants. <p>\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  Our principal activity is maraillage; that is, we purchase fish from the village fishermen which we sell in the town of Oussouye, to travelers on the national road that passes through our region, and also to hotels.  We also conduct commercial activities, selling local products that we produce ourselves, such as palm oil, oysters, clams, etc.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: Le village de Effock, est un village en reconstruction apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9cu plus de 10 ann\u00e9es sous le feu de la guerre avec le probl\u00e8me en Casamance.\r\nEtant en reconstruction, les populations nous avons besoin d\u2019un soutien financier qui va nous aider \u00e0 bien mener nos activit\u00e9s   pour mieux affront\u00e9e cette nouvelle phase que nous entamons. <p>\r\n Objectifs du Pr\u00eat : Lutter contre l\u2019exode, dans le cadre de la reconstruction du village, am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie des populations. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Notre activit\u00e9 principale est : le maraillage c\\\\\\'est-\u00e0-dire que nous achetons du poisson aupr\u00e8s des p\u00eacheurs du village et que nous revendons \u00e0 Oussouye, sur la route nationale aux passagers et aussi dans les structures h\u00f4telier.\r\nNous menons aussi des activit\u00e9s commerciales en vendant  des produits locaux que nous produisons nous m\u00eame tel que : huile de palme, hu\u00eetres, mollusques etc. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":6869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing fish; purchasing containers for palm oil; renting canoe for collecting oysters and transportation of goods to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Effock","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-09T01:33:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-23T08:51:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":875,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-03-23T04:44:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11577},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-04-21T21:01:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13446},{"amount":104,"local_amount":104,"processed_date":"2007-05-10T09:15:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15790},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:35:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34407},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41430},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50168},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:46:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63363},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80010},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93757},{"amount":157,"local_amount":157,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106900}],"funded_date":"2006-12-09T08:51:26Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6575,"name":"Kweku","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kweku is 49 years old and father of 5 children who are all in school.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They both have 5 children, but only live with 2 of them: Jose, age 20, and Jean Carlos, age 12. They live together in their own home in the Palcamayo village. They own three plots of land for growing crops. Every day, Armanda goes to sow peas and spinach: crops which she cares for, waters and fertilizers for approximately three months. This is sufficient time to harvest them and sell them in the central market of their area. She says that there are seasons when demand is greater, so she travels to the capital to offer them at a better price. From her childhood, she was taught to work the land and make it produce. She knows when it is harvest time, and when to sell and at what price; during all this time Armanda has always been upset to see her crops fail in the constant frost that batters the south of the country. She now wants to continue harvesting, so she will buy more land in order to expand her planting. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she is grateful for the help that her community bank offers her. With this help, she can work and invest more.

Two are at the college level while the other is an elementary graduate. \r\n\r\nLike others, her family has encountered problems brought about by poverty, but fortunately, they have overcome the problems because they really help each other. \r\n\r\nShe is thankful to ASHI because she has been able to borrow a certain amount that they used in their business of buying and selling rice.\r\n\r\nAs of now, her business is improving and they earn from it, which has been a big help for them in sustaining their basic needs. At present, they have already successfully paid their previous loan and they are proposing a new loan of PHP 20,000. This amount will be used as additional capital for her rice business.\r\n\r\nFrom their income, she hopes to repair their house so that it will be comfortable for them. She wants to extend their store and to have a dryer. Aside from that, she also wishes to expand the business so that they can help the people in the community through providing them a job.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":703821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

All the entrepreneurs live in the city of Temuco.\r\n\r\nCarolina is a member of the Communal Bank, who is seated in the front row of the photo, first person to the right.  She is wearing dark clothes, and her dark brown hair is down.\r\n\r\nShe has been working selling new clothes for the last year.  She makes her sales by going door to door, and also out of her home.  Generally, her schedule is to work Mondays to Fridays in the afternoons.  Carolina offers payment facilities to her customers, which has maD. her sales easier and gained her a number of customers.  She usually buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nHer goals for her business are to have established premises selling clothing, where she can also incluD. toys for sale.  With the loan she will buy vests, sweatshirts, and shirts, according to the season.\r\n\r\nCarolina lives with her husband and her two-year-old daughter.  Her dreams are to continue working to be able to proviD. her family with a better quality of live and improved well-being.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the loans and for the services offered by Fondo Esperanza.  She also feels very comfortable participating in the Communal Bank group, as they are very committed, responsible and nice people.  In regard to the trainings, these have helped her to manager her business in a better way.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is located 670 km south of Santiago (the capital of Chile).  There is a string of lake resorts (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica) in the surrounding area, and striking native flora and fauna are concentrated in the national parks nearby.  It is worth nothing that 50% of the Mapuches, the indigenous people from our country, live in this region.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":858008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Let\u2019s help this family to remain strong and united.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Both have worked hard to make improvements to their home and workshop.  She is 49 years old and has three children; two are students, and one is working.  She has a number of years managing the upholstery shop.  Previously, she worked in the free trade zone where her husband worked in furniture repair.  She quit her job, and with the liquidation was able to invest in lumber to generate more income by selling chairs, sofas, and fixing furniture.  One challenge has been the high cost of lumber.  Even the covers for this work are costly, forcing her to charge higher prices and therefore lose some sales.  \r\n\r\nWith the previous loan, she managed to install a location at the front of her house where she could work under better conditions given she does not have a locale of her own.   With this loan, she will be able to close up the porch and buy materials such as:  stone, sand, cement, and metal.  Enclosing the area will have an added benefit for the family as well as the business, as she hopes to capture more customers by offering high-quality workmanship and delivery of her products.  Long-term plans include establishing a separate workshop for her enterprise through financing from additional loans. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":503601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase construction materials such as stone, sand, cement and metal to build a porch.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.03,"local_amount":1510.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1523.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604596},{"amount":72.8,"local_amount":1506.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1518.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640068},{"amount":71.67,"local_amount":1482.83,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1494.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821854},{"amount":76.65,"local_amount":1585.82,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1598.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561863},{"amount":71.99,"local_amount":1489.45,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1501.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770780},{"amount":73.06,"local_amount":1511.61,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1523.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204672},{"amount":73.6,"local_amount":1522.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330377},{"amount":147.83,"local_amount":3058.58,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3083.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465537},{"amount":64.37,"local_amount":1331.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1342.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097690}],"funded_date":"2010-04-01T18:14:24Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":187713,"name":"Enhsaihan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enhsaihan is 36 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Uvs province, Mongolia.

Estrellita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Estrellita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third one taken out by Estrellita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue she generates to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling seafood products  including dried fish and squid in the local community. Elsa has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elsa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Elsa is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like dried fish and squid. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Elsa from HSPFI.

Manila. Novie barely finished high school, but she definitely believes that there is more in store for her. She is married to Lindro, a security guard. They now live in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nNovie operates her own sari-sari (variety) store, and at the same time rents out karaoke machines to friends and acquaintances who are fond of incorporating music into their personal events. Novie has two employees who help her with the daily work of accommodating clients and maintaining the business. Monthly, she earns around Php11,000.\r\n\r\nDetermined to grow her business, Novie is requesting a Php 28, 000 loan. She aims to use this money to boost her sari-sari store business. She will buy sacks of rice and charcoal, which she will repackage for retail. She will also buy trays of eggs, canned goods, and diapers for babies, which she knows her community needs based on her ten years of experience in the business.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment she arrived in Manila, Novie holds on to her dream of a peaceful and abundant life. One hindrance to this is the headache she receives from customers who do not pay. However, she gets hold of a way to solve this issue. She desires for an expansion of her business, and that implies not settling for anything less in terms of service and profit.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, Novie faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":713543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase products to sell in store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baseco, Manila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-16T07:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Novie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130,"local_amount":5599.97,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5667.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814244},{"amount":173.33,"local_amount":7466.72,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7556.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256809},{"amount":173.34,"local_amount":7466.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7556.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123502},{"amount":173.33,"local_amount":7466.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7556.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194787}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T12:49:31Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":277856,"name":"Edgar's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edgar D. is from the village of Dummon. He is 36 years old. Edgar is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by ASKI.

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Edgar D.\".\r\n\r\nEdgar is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Edgar owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Edgar has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Edgar joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

These stocks in trade have endeared her not only to her laborers but also her clients. As such, she has been notching up successes in her transactions the last six years since she took root. Every business has its downsides and quarry businesses are invariably fraught with them, including 38-year-old Harriet's but her unwavering tenacity has been her recourse. The experience mill she has gone through in this business has taught her a lot. She says laying great store on patience has been key. Her business was thrown into gear after a pep talk by close friends and family. Before that, she was mostly preoccupied by tailoring. She has been carving out a niche gradually and she reckons her future prospects will only get better with time. Her clientele base principally consists of middle class civil servants beginning to build and construction firm people.\r\n\r\nHarriet who is a married mother of three says her gross weekly sales revenue is to the tune of Ugandan shillings 40,000. This may be paltry, but she says by the end of this year, she expects to be making more. By all accounts, this is the group's maiden loan from Pearl Micro-finance. The integrity of the other group members is something Harriet speaks highly of and she does not expect any difficulty in repaying their loan. Given Harriet's tenacity, diligence, optimism and good working relationships, her odds of business success look good. This Kiva loan she anticipates will throw her business in an even stronger gear.

They have their own house in the  Ricric\u00e1n village, Palcamayo district.  Teo is a tireless woman who despite her years, has lots of energy to work full-time     in farming.  She has planted potatoes and ollucos (indigenous Peruvian tuber) in her fields but these only earn her money in certain seasons of the year.  \r\n\r\nShe also sells meats and vegetables in Chanchamayo.  Teo has 50 sheep that she sells for their meat and parts.  She buys the vegetables at the wholesale market and sells them retail in Chanchamayo.  She has to travel to make these sales twice a week.\r\nTeo is sure that at this pace she will be able to build her house in the center of Palcamayo but for now it will be constructed of rustic materials.  She will do this for her children so that they will live closer to their schools.  With your help, this will be her 15th loan with MFP.  She promises to be punctual with her payments and she feels content with the communal bank because of the solidarity among the members.\r\nShe will use half the money to buy sacks of organic fertilier and the other half to purchase vegetables for the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":930883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of organic fertilizer for the vegetables to supply her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:05:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teofila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455351}],"funded_date":"2011-12-05T08:13:33Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":368044,"name":"Mary Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jean, a 39-year-old married mother of four children, one of whom is in school, is a very hard-working entrepreneur who has operated a beauty products business in the Philippines for the past year.
