","en":"Mavzhuda lives and works in the northern part of mountainous Tajikistan. Like many other residents of the region, she works in agriculture, a business she began five years ago. At first it was very difficult for her to work in the fields from early morning to late evening under the hot sun. But she gradually got accustomed to the work and now is gradually developing her business. She also works in animal husbandry, since she doesn't earn enough money from growing crops. In the winter, animal husbandry is her primary occupation.\r\n\r\nMavzhuda is requesting a loan of 5,000 somoni to purchase livestock, which will increase her working capital.

He did not attend school because of lack of financial resources in his home. He is married. His wife works in household chores and makes sleeping mats to sell. They have four children: only three of them live in their house, and only two of them are studying and working in their free time from school. Jose works in agriculture, a job he has done for more than 20 years. His father is the one who taught him to be a good farmer, and currently he produces basic grains for family consumption. He walks five minutes from his house to get to the land plot where he has his crops. Every day, he works very hard to improve the family finances. In their free time, his children help him with his work. He needs the loan to pay off a loan he requested from another bank where he is paying very high interest. Also, he will invest part of the money to improve his house so it is safer and prettier, and his family will feel better. He plans to remodel his house and live in a better environment. He also wants to help his children in everything possible so they study a career and have more opportunities in life, and to keep on working hard to move forward. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1708501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to pay off a loan he requested from another bank, and to improve his house so it is safer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-10-18T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-17T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":23.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":24.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Mueller","image":null}},{"id":767469,"name":"Kim Sreang's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kim Sreang is from a rural village in the Tbaung Khmum district of Kampong Cham province.

Marhamat works in agriculture; she mainly grows vegetables, which she sells in bulk quantities at the local market.  She's been involved in this business for more than 15 years.  She is also taking care of her children alone, since her husband has been living abroad as a migrant worker for many years.  Marhamat's son, Chumaboy, attends the Tajik State University of Business and Politics, where he is a first-year student at the Faculty of Law.  Marhamat needs to pay her son's university tuition, and for this reason, she is taking a loan of 1,050 USD.

She also has a higher education.  About 20 years ago she started a business in farming and animal husbandry.  As a result of her backbreaking labor and intense work, she has had good success in developing her business, with her monthly  income now coming to 6,500 som (KGS).  Currently, Indira has 10 sheep, a cow, and a bull calf.   She also has a 1.8 ha plot of land where she grows sainfoin.  However, her income isn't enough to provide her with a decent standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis year there was a drought and Indira had a very bad harvest.  She was not able to harvest enough feed for her cattle.  With an aim to developing her business further, Indira applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to buy 100 bales of hay for her cattle.  She intends to invest the profits from her loan in continuing to increase the size of her

She has a specialized secondary level education and for 20 years she has worked as an administrative manager.   For many years, she has also been in the cattle business.  As a result of her hard work, today Aichurok has four cows and 20 sheep.  The monthly profit from her business comes to 3,000 som (KGS).  Even counting her salary, her income is far from enough to ensure a decent standard of living and provide for her school-aged children.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her business further, Aichurok applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy four calves.  She plans to invest the profits from the loan in continuing to develop her business so she can save up money for her children's higher educations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1712984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

She is a very kind, polite, and hospitable woman.  Megilikhol is 61 years old and, having lost her husband, a widow, but she is proud to be a mother, mother-in-law, and grandmother.  Her son moved abroad to find work.  Megilikol lives in the same house with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren.  Her daughter-in-law is a seamstress who works from home making tailored clothes.  Megilikhol has a cattle business, which she started 10 years ago.  She buys young calves and, after a lengthy process of raising and fattening them, she sells them at the cattle market.  She earns her living in this clever manner.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Megilikhol desperately needs to repair her home before winter.  She's worried about her little grandchildren's health and she hopes that she will soon find help with this.  Please support her.

So to help her husband financially, Purnima runs her own cattle-rearing business. She sells cow milk to her neighbors. By running her own business, she gives support to her family financially.

village of Moiben, Kapsowar. He has been practicing agribusiness for the past six years and has never looked back. For a living, Edward sells milk and food products from his farm into the local market. He makes extra money with a business running the only diesel posho mill in his village since there is no electricity connection. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied. \r\n\r\nAlthough Edward has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. Edward is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kapsowar and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Edward does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Edward is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Edward will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm. Through this loan, he will assure his large family a secure future and improved living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":990.56,"image":{"id":1713176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

is single and lives in the village of Kapsaiya in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. As a young boy, he watched women in his village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led him to join Ogikgei self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor the past three years he has been actively involved in mixed farming. He never got the chance to get a white collar job but this has not been a set back because Mathew has been making great profits in farming. Kapsowar is one of the places that have favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming that is good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Mathew has always wanted to diversify and start horticulture farming, but the biggest challenge he has been facing is lack of funds to start the business off the ground. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to start horticulture farming. Through Ogikgei self-help group which is a group where members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, he joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan he intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow him transport the produce faster to an international market hence making more money. This loan will improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1713233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-18T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-17T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mathew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.61,"local_amount":3698.6,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3703.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625291},{"amount":38.36,"local_amount":3409.82,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3414.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194447},{"amount":35.76,"local_amount":3178.53,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3182.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823749},{"amount":41.03,"local_amount":3647.42,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3652.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262273},{"amount":38.68,"local_amount":3438.23,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3442.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264368},{"amount":47.82,"local_amount":4250.55,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4255.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600574},{"amount":76.04,"local_amount":7015.38,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7024.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.88,"payment_id":681377426},{"amount":11.98,"local_amount":1112.62,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1114.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.54,"payment_id":696587165},{"amount":38.99,"local_amount":3730.43,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3735.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.98,"payment_id":711505435},{"amount":69.54,"local_amount":6518.42,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6526.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.79,"payment_id":731022280}],"funded_date":"2014-10-18T20:01:15Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":782919,"name":"Omorde Bor Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These people are part of group called Omoden Bor.

colorful in the Americas. Vendors arrive from all parts of the country and set up in the early hours of the morning. When visitors arrive, they slowly walk through crowded aisles viewing hundreds of traditional colorful textiles, an amazing variety of arts and crafts. The smoke from copal incense burned on the steps of the church permeates the entire market. It is truly a rich sensory experience in every way.\r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCumez\u201d is located in the busy town. Sebastiana is a 53-year-old married member of the Trust Bank with six children. As a child, Sebastiana learned to weave and embroider the unique and beautiful blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d that the women proudly wear. Each town has its own pattern and style and those from Chichicastenango are quite colorful and filled with geometrical designs or flowers. They take many weeks or months to fabricate. Sebastiana has enjoyed success in her textile business and has been able to generate extra income to support her family. At this time of year, business usually increases and Sebastiana wants to meet the increased demand of her customers and so she is requesting a loan. She will use the funds to purchase good quality thread in a variety of colors and other necessary supplies.\r\n\r\nSebastiana and her thirteen friends in the Trust Bank appreciate the opportunity to access practical information that will help them manage their loans and help their families. Each month at the meeting of the Trust Bank, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer offers the women educational seminars given in their native language of Maya-kiche. Some of the topics discussed include women\u2019s health, empowerment and self-esteem, hygiene, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants as well as essential information about effective business management practices. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it is very effective.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank extend their gratitude to KIVA investors from throughout the world for their kindness and generosity in funding their loans. We look forward to providing a follow up report on the fourteen women of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCumez\u201d."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4500,"image":{"id":1712538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

colonial times for the production of black salt or \u201csal negra\u201d.  The salt can only be extracted from one of two rivers in the town between January and April. It used to be the main business activity of the municipality but now, few are involved in the endeavor as it has become quite complicated. \r\n\r\nNine women of the town have joined forces and created the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEl Buen Samaritano\u201d or \u201cThe Good Samaritan\u201d.  Fiercely traditional, the women celebrate their rich cultural heritage in many ways. They all speak their indigenous language of K\u2019ich\u00e9 and only a few understand Spanish. They wear traditional dress or \u201ctraje\u201d. They share the common goal of raising their standards for themselves and their families, eliminating poverty in their lives and moving ahead into a brighter and more prosperous future. Some of their businesses include a \u201ctortilleria\u201d or a shop where tortillas are made three times each day, vegetable sales, a tomato farm and a convenience store.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the Trust Bank is 26 year old Magdalena who has a small convenience store. She employs a young man to help her in the store as business is expanding. She needs to increase her inventory and purchase essential items like rice, beans, noodles, sugar, cold cuts and other items. In addition, she has a plan to open an additional store and fill it with items for everyday consumption like her first store. For all these reasons, Magdalena is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she hopes will be funded by Kiva investors.\r\n\r\nMagdalena and her friends in the Trust Bank are keenly aware of the importance of education, both for themselves as businesswomen and heads of household and for their children. Magdalena is pleased that two of her children attend school. Her success in her convenience store is partially due to what she has learned from the monthly meetings of her Trust Bank when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares practical and useful information on a variety of relevant subjects. The women learn about effective business management practices, nutrition, health and hygiene, women\u2019s rights and self-esteem. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are valued partners with Friendship Bridge in providing loans and opportunities for Magdalena and the women in the Trust Bank \u201cEl Buen Samaritano\u201d.  The ladies extend their heartfelt gratitude to all. They feel hopeful about their future and we look forward to reporting on their progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4775,"image":{"id":1713531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She and her husband look after the farm. They produce vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, carrots, cabbages, chili, cucumbers, papayas, ladies finger, popcorn, etc., in the farm. Traders from nearby towns come to her farm for lifting the products for selling. \r\n\r\nShe earns a monthly income of 6,000 INR from the above businesses. Sebani said this income is not sufficient for her to save some for the better education of her children and construct a good house for her family. So for the expansion of her farming, she has taken a loan of 16,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation. From this loan, she has planned to buy fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides, and purchase a diesel water lifting pump for smooth watering of her farm. \r\n\r\nShe expects a good return from this investment to change her style of livelihood and be a respectable person.\r\n\r\nAmong the other nine members of the group, two are doing farming, four members are running general stores, and the next three members are doing milk selling businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1713266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides for the farm, and purchase a diesel water lifting pump for smooth watering.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KODOBEDA, SINAPALI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-10-18T16:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-17T16:10:11Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanchale ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lipi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raebari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":160000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-05T15:29:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":782936,"name":"For Christ Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of this group are part of For Christ group from Chorkor-Accra, Ghana.

For this reason he wishes to put down a cement floor in his home and paint the sheets that form the walls of the house.\r\n\r\nKnowing that he does not have the funds to make the improvements, he has made the decision to ask for a loan from FUSAI in order to invest in: paint, cement, sand and gravel to paint the walls and put down a cement floor in his house.

Therefore, Abida has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

She is the featured member of the group Wigiang. All the group members are from Makhan village, Manipur. \r\n\r\nTathoniu has two children who are still in their primary school. Her husband is a farmer. She supports her family by selling vegetables in the market. Early in the morning, she carries a stock of vegetables and heads toward the market to sell various items. \u201cBusiness is good in the morning,\u201d she said. She makes a small profit from the vegetables she sells at the market from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. daily. This is the time when people will go to the market to buy vegetables for lunch and dinner. \r\n\r\nWhen she returns from the market, she will buy essential items for the household use on the way. After reaching home, she takes lunch and goes to their field with her husband and looks after the crops they grow. She also buys vegetables from suppliers for selling, since her production is not enough for daily selling. She requires capital to buy more stock of vegetables for selling purposes, since she has to buy from other people. \r\n\r\nIf she stops selling vegetables during the off season, the family will be short of money for the household requirements. The small profit she makes provides for her family\u2019s daily requirement, which make the business essential. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan for buying more stock of vegetables, including potatoes, ginger, mustard, corn, mushrooms, etc. She will sell the items to make more profit and earn more income so that her family\u2019s financial problems will be solved. She is very happy to avail herself of the loan and said, \u201cThank you so much Kiva.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are also engaged in similar business activities. They will use the loan for buying livestock, saplings, and vegetables to generate income for their households.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1712138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy stock of vegetables for selling in the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-10-18T21:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-17T21:00:15Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luwangthon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awangpui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lungluliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tathoniu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khaosaliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Komlungliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Withon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":105000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-26T15:12:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":783241,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane needs a loan to pay school fees for her children.

Most people that live here work in agriculture and in raising animals, as this is a region with great vegetation.\r\n\r\nAreliza lives here. She is 64 years old, she is married, and she has six children that are now all adults. One of her children lives in her home. Her husband works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nAreliza is a hard-working woman that strives to get ahead. She makes candies for parties and weddings. Generally, she has contracts to make her candies every weekend. She also has a small farm at her house and she raises chickens. When the chickens are ready, she sells them to her neighbors. This is how she makes extra money in order to get by.

Today, this humble mother of four children sells milk, eggs, tea and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit.

Meet Mary, a youthful 78-year-old shosho (old mum), a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in Githirioni, a remote village in Thika. She is happily married and is blessed with five adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last ten years and has gained so much experience. \r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Thika area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, Mary feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1713903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-19T02:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-18T02:50:20Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.8,"local_amount":4696.95,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4882.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823751},{"amount":26.09,"local_amount":2235.87,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2324.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264371},{"amount":25.3,"local_amount":2168.56,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2254.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600575},{"amount":29.77,"local_amount":2552.11,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2652.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459060},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":2499.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2598.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":681377427},{"amount":27.67,"local_amount":2475.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"payment_id":696587167},{"amount":28.74,"local_amount":2648.28,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2752.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.16,"payment_id":711505437},{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":10723.54,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":11147.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.32,"payment_id":731022282}],"funded_date":"2014-10-19T03:46:57Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Revie","image":692978}},{"id":783305,"name":"Cristina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristina is 54 years old and lives in Mialem, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

dedicated farmer. She is based in Kenyenya. It is a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married and, together with her husband, has two lovely children. Her primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Risper is a tough woman with tough skin and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling. The Kenyenya area has conditions that favor dairy farming and Risper has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow but the lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow. The dairy cow she intends to buy is not just an ordinary cow. It\u2019s a breed that produces between 10-20 liters of milk a day. With this cow, she will produce more milk which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Kapsowar area is high but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Risper is going to reap more and comfortably meet the demand. Her increased income will allow her to provide a secure future for her school-going children by paying their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success. Her vision is to keep even more dairy cows so that she will be able to build a bio gas digester, which would help her to save more energy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1713871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality exotic breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyenya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-19T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-18T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Risper","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1472.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1515.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1559.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1604.9},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1651.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1700.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1749.82},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1800.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1853.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1907.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1963.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.67,"local_amount":1553.17,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1663.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625292},{"amount":18.92,"local_amount":1573.76,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194449},{"amount":17.96,"local_amount":1494.64,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1600.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823750},{"amount":19.89,"local_amount":1654.47,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262275},{"amount":116.05,"local_amount":9655.53,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10340.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264370},{"amount":54.42,"local_amount":4868.43,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.09,"payment_id":711505436}],"funded_date":"2014-10-19T06:45:38Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyle Setzer","image":244339}},{"id":779754,"name":"Lorena Vanessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Tosagua cada quince d\u00edas se re\u00fane el Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito San Crist\u00f3bal, este lugar se lo conoce por ser muy din\u00e1mico donde la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedican a la agricultura y a la cr\u00eda de animales, por ser una zona con gran vegetaci\u00f3n.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Lorena, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera tiene una  hija de 3 a\u00f1os de edad, la cual es su compa\u00f1\u00eda. \nDo\u00f1a Lorena es una gran madre que lucha d\u00eda a d\u00eda para sacar adelante a su hija, ella se dedica al comercio, vende ropa de todo tipo, sabanas, edredones, zapatos, entre otras cosas, su forma de venta es puerta a puerta, realiza sus recorridos  cuatro d\u00edas por semana all\u00ed mismo deja y cobra  ya que  deja sus productos a cr\u00e9dito y cobra cada semana.

the land, and 80 percent of the food that people eat comes from people who sell in the rural marketplace,\u201d says Rahab, a 42-year-old mixed farmer based in Githunguri, a remote village in the Thika area of Kenya. This charming mother of four has been engaged in mixed farming for the past two years. She commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in her village. Her main source of income has been eggs, milk, tea, and a variety of food crops that she plants. Taking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Thika. Rahab has a good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Rahab will achieve their dreams and goals. Rahab believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":185.27,"image":{"id":1713947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-19T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-18T05:50:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.23,"local_amount":3131.3,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3138.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823752},{"amount":16.77,"local_amount":1490.58,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1494.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264372},{"amount":16.26,"local_amount":1445.71,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1449.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600576},{"amount":19.14,"local_amount":1701.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1705.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459061},{"amount":18.08,"local_amount":1666.38,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1670.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.67,"payment_id":681377428},{"amount":17.78,"local_amount":1650.08,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1654,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":696587168},{"amount":18.47,"local_amount":1765.53,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1769.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.39,"payment_id":711505438},{"amount":19.28,"local_amount":1805,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1809.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":731022283},{"amount":19.49,"local_amount":1812.58,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1816.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.9,"payment_id":752110557}],"funded_date":"2014-10-19T12:14:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":783379,"name":"Francine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francine, 50 years old, is married with four children between 10 and 20 years old, three of whom go to school.

She is getting ready to open a caf\u00e9 in a premises she has rented in her native Shahrituz region's main recreational and amusement park.  She will be paying about $100 (USD) per month in rent.  \r\n\r\nRight now, Bibiroila has about $300 left in savings, but to open the caf\u00e9 she needs another $1,500 and she has applied for a loan in this amount. Bibiroila is going to use this money to buy a large electric range and food supplies for preparing meals.  To start, her menu will consist of four traditional dishes, but Bibiroila plans to expand it in the future.
