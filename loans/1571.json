She has a great desire to start her own business, which will help her to tackle her financial difficulties and make a good life for her sons. \r\n\r\nThe family belongs to the subsistence poor category, as they have no source of income and live in poverty.  According to the above-mentioned situation, Keto lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require a stable income and business experience. \r\n\r\nThe Start-Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Keto to get a loan of GEL 2,100 to start her own business.  She will purchase a stock of merchandise and devices and start lemonade-making. Keto thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in great location and the only business of this kind in the area. \r\n\r\nAfter the factory is opened, the family will have a stable income which will enable them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in the future. With the support of the Start-Up program, Keto will get an opportunity to be involved in her own business and tackle her financial difficulties."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":482.52,"image":{"id":1714059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To

She is a 46-year-old who lives with her husband and three children (one son and two daughters) in Madhya Barogari in the district of Jalpaiguri.  Two of her children are receiving education, one is pursuing her bachelor degree and other is in grade 10. But the son works in a saloon. She is a homemaker who looks after her children and husband and also manages her household jobs. In her spare time she helps her husband in his work.\r\n\r\nShephali's husband, Paresh, is a cultivator. He cultivates his land and grows vegetables.  But he wants to grow paddy on his farmland, as his current income from vegetable cultivation is not very satisfactory. His income can hardly cover the household expenses and educational expenses of his children.

Meet Joan from Nandi Hills in Kenya, a woman from a community not known for farming but she is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married and together with her husband, is blessed with two lovely children. For the past 5 years, she has been practicing mixed farming.  Because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from her fellow farmers and she is regarded as a mentor. The income from milk, eggs, and tea selling have allowed her to earn a decent income. To earn extra income, Joan engages in a small personal business.\r\n\r\nJoan passionately loves dairy farming and the animals on her farm have been given names of \u201cSeroi.\u201d Milking and feeding Seroi (the name of her cow) makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers, then sending text messages to her customers when milk is ready for collection, and because of using ICT, she has had a comparative edge in her dairy business. Demand has been overwhelming and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Joan does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow but she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 15-20 litres of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate to more income and Joan will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school going children. \r\n\r\nWhen anybody listens to Joan speak, one would be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming but because of her passion and determination she intends to beat all odds. This loan will permanently change Joan's living standards and there is no doubt that you can find rewarding employment in dairy farming."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1714137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Their son is too young to go to school. \r\n\r\nJafina is a homemaker who looks after her child, does all the household work, and in her spare time helps her husband in his farm work. Her husband is a farmer. He is engaged in farming, growing rice and vegetables. He has farmland which is his investment and inheritance from his parents. He struggles hard to grow good quality produce. He is a person who is looking to his family's well-being. But the income generated from the farming is not sufficient to cover all their expenses. They want to grow more paddy rice in order to earn more profits. \r\n\r\nSo Jafina requested a loan from BJS to buy seeds, fertilizers, and herbicides for paddy cultivation. They believe that the loan will help provide all of their farming needs and in that way they will obtain higher revenues.  They will be able to improve the well-being of their family.\r\n\r\nJafina wants to upgrade their present house with the profit earned and she is thankful to her lenders BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1714153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural inputs for growing paddy rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-19T14:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-18T14:20:09Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jafina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-19T22:58:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":783514,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Grace, thirty-nine years old, married and blessed with three children whom she lives with.

She makes pants, skirts and jackets to measure and also modifies any type of clothing according to the whims of her clients who are conscious of the importance of dressing well. She enjoys her work so much that she feels like a designer and creatively suggests to her clients what clothing they should use. <br \/><br \/>She has a cutting table where she begins the adventure, with agility, precision and speed, qualities that add up to care and dedication. Her hands see the result, a made to measure article of clothing. In her work space she needs a normal sewing machine, a serger and a flat lock sewing machine.

years ago, Joseph, 27 years of age, started practicing mixed farming in a small piece of inherited land in his rural town of Siongiroi. Today, he boasts of the great strides he has made in dairy farming. This ambitious father of one earns his livelihood through selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from his farm. He also does some \"side hustle\" to make extra income. \r\n\r\nAlthough he makes profits from dairy farming, he is faced with challenges that might put him down. Cows in his farm are affected by harsh weather conditions; hence, they become sick. He also faces challenges of properly feeding and milking his cows. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Cows require a proper resting place and proper food so that they can produce the maximum amount of milk. Without a proper dairy unit, cows will be affected with diseases, and also, they will not have a good place to rest and feed, hence, a low production of milk. \r\n\r\nJoseph feels relieved knowing that there are partners such as Kiva lenders who assist aspiring men such as himself to achieve their dreams. With your loan Joseph is going to change his life permanently, and the increased income from high milk production will be used in paying back the loan fully and improving his living standards."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1714171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-19T15:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-18T15:40:18Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.13,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.97,"local_amount":5283.77,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5432.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625294},{"amount":52.18,"local_amount":4522.1,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4649.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194451},{"amount":57.63,"local_amount":4994.49,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5134.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823754},{"amount":58.64,"local_amount":5081.82,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5224.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262276},{"amount":60.29,"local_amount":5225.38,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5372.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264374},{"amount":62.89,"local_amount":5450.73,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5603.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600578},{"amount":136.84,"local_amount":11859.23,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12192.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459063},{"amount":115.39,"local_amount":10437.87,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10730.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.05,"payment_id":696587170},{"amount":133.04,"local_amount":12144.61,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12485.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.08,"payment_id":731022285}],"funded_date":"2014-11-17T18:15:09Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":783529,"name":"Hasena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasena is a 42-year-old woman.

mistake him for an Agricultural Extension Officer. Joseph, from Kapsowar, a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer of his locality. He has a wife and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops and personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 15 years. Having done farming for such a long time he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Maasai tribe (Joseph\u2019s tribe) - where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Joseph wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Joseph has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. Joseph always says that, \u201cTo become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d He has planted so many trees on his farm and dairy food will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge, because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Joseph will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. Joseph has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Joseph chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Joseph underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits Joseph plans to permanently improve his living conditions, and to secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. He plans that through increased income, he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1714186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is happily married and has been blessed with five angelic looking children. \r\n\r\nHe has been practicing farming for the past five years, and has never looked back. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. Most of the small holder farmers in Kiangoso village own approximately \u00bc acre of land per household, and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living through milk and egg selling and a personal business. These ventures have enabled him to send his children to school and feed his family. \r\n\r\nCharles has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow, thereby enhancing his milk-selling profits. Because of increased demand, Charles is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Charles is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Through increased profits, Charles is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. \r\n\r\nCharles, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment. Juhudi Kilimo, through its training, has helped Charles save more effectively, and through his accumulated profits, he plans to add value to his milk through packaging. He also hopes to one day start manufacturing milk products such as yoghurt and cream.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1714214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

All her kids are in high school. She manages her own household while operating the business.  At this time, she works hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nMa. Cecilia operates a business selling school and office supplies. It is where one can buy school supplies, like pens, bond paper, Cartolina, and the like, without going to a bookstore. She gets the supplies at wholesale prices and sells them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her expand her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to obtain additional office and school supplies to increase her product inventory. She is positive that her sales and income will improve as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nMa. Cecilia hopes to be able to open an outlet for her school and office supplies. She dreams to give her family a better life and send all her children to college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1714262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for office and school supplies to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-19T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-18T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

She has a high school education and works as a cleaner. Since 1996 she has been working in agriculture and animal husbandry as an additional source of income for her family. Thanks to her hard work, she currently has two cows, one steer, one horse and 50 sheep as well as 1.08 hectares of irrigated land where she grows barley for her own use.

Her business is located in the outskirts of town and her main customers are women.\r\n\r\nHawa has just completed repaying her second loan and needs a third loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL to help her purchase more bags of rice, groundnuts, beans and garri for resale.

Saturnino. She is from Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is one of the factory workers who benefits from CCT\u2019s employment assistance through Covenant Community Service Cooperative* and loan assistance through CCT Credit Cooperative.\r\n\r\nAvelina works as a Garment Production Worker.  She plays an important role in garment making processes from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging and shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Avelina is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Avelina is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem repaying since the loan payment is deducted every payday. She looks forward to your positive response; any help from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to redeem the ATM card that she pawned.\r\n\r\nAvelina wants to always have good health and enough strength in every day. She dreams for her family to have a prosperous life in the years to come. She meets with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1714632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To claim her pawned ATM card.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-19T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-18T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.26,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625599},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3790.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535743},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134090},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1263.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756857}],"funded_date":"2014-10-19T23:10:12Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":783859,"name":"Pha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pha, who is 64 years old, lives in a rural area of Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

All her children are grown-ups and independent. Kanymbu has secondary education. She has worked with agriculture since 1974 - livestock breeding and field crop cultivation. \r\n\r\nThanks to her long experience and tireless work, her farm currently has two dairy cows and 10 sheep and goats. Kanymbu and her husband also grow barley for own use on 0.60 hectares of rented, irrigated land. In addition, Kanymbu sells milk to the local residents.

She worked as a nurse for many years, but since 1995, Shariypa has worked with agriculture. Currently she has two dairy cows and two horses at her farm. She also has a plot of land of 1.60 hectares, where she and her husband grow haricots. Shariypa also sells milk to the local residents. The family is happy to take up any kind of work, and the children help their parents actively with the household. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Shariypa turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase a dairy cow with calf to increase the number of cattle and especially to increase the volume of milk received. As the milk is domestic, ecological and very tasty, it is in great demand.\r\n\r\nShariypa plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and to give her son

world! Meet Dorcas. Dorcas, 30, is a very dedicated mother who believes in hard work. She is happily married and blessed with two lovely children whom she often refers to as \u201cmy pride.\u201d She is based in Kapsowar, a small remote rural town in Kenya that has bad terrain and is characterized by drought and bad weather conditions. For the past three years, Dorcas has been actively involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income is from milk and crop farming. Dorcas passionately loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of her cows \u201cDadii.\u201d Milking Dadii is her hobby and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Dorcas. Although this humble mom makes a living through selling milk, she faces the challenge of irrigating her farm and providing water to her animals. Kapsowar is a remote area without piped water or electricity. Since Dorcas is from a marginalized community, she is forced to walk long distances to search for water. She typically walks for two hours. Therefore, Dorcas is requesting a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the rain water in this area goes to waste and Dorcas wants to harvest the water and store it in a water tank. The loan will save Dorcas time and allow her to irrigate her farm during dry seasons and increase her productivity. The increase in productivity will translate into more income, which will provide Dorcas with financial security. Dorcas will also use the stored water for home consumption. Dorcas' dream is to increase her farming activities and provide her children with a proper education. Education is the only way that her children, who are from a marginalized community, can succeed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1714729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank and water pipes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-20T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-19T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorcas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.47,"local_amount":4925.86,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5120.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194455},{"amount":55.65,"local_amount":4769.68,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4958.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262280},{"amount":58.53,"local_amount":5017.11,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5215.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600581},{"amount":61.35,"local_amount":5451.49,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5666.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.25,"payment_id":681377433},{"amount":60.5,"local_amount":5576.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5796.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.55,"payment_id":711505443},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":4259.85,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4428.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.2,"payment_id":752110559}],"funded_date":"2014-10-20T06:12:56Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":783947,"name":"Asia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asia, 36, is married and blessed with three children.

Philippines. He has two children and they are already studying. Cherry Lou, his wife, also works as a factory worker and they are both beneficiaries of the employment services supervised by the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nBertmar works as a Garment Production Worker. He plays an important role in the garment-making processes, from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging, and shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Bertmar, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collaterals. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Bertmar is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to any loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. He looks forward for your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. He will use the loan to pay for their specific needs and expenses, and also to sustain the education of his children.\r\n\r\nBertmar dreams of operating and managing his own garment-making business someday so that he will have more time for his family. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members regularly to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1714741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the personal needs of his family and their household expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-20T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-19T03:20:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertmar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2246,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625600},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3369,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535744},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2246,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134091},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1122.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756858}],"funded_date":"2014-10-20T04:07:01Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":783965,"name":"Edna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edna is a resident of Dulag, Leyte.

in Kapsowar, Kenya. The rich soil of this area makes it one of the nation\u2019s biggest mango growing regions, lending it the nickname of \u201cmango region.\u201d For the past 3 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops. These ventures have allowed her earn a decent income.\r\n\r\nNorah passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of funds. However, this challenge has not made her give up: \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201d she has said.\r\n\r\nShe mobilized other enterprising women like her in her village and they have joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a micro finance organization that assists small-scale farmers through giving out loans and training. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy additional poultry.

Alicia lives in Nueva California.  She is 48 years old, is divorced, and her relationship produced three children - two older and independent, and the youngest, who is 17 years old and studying in secondary school. \r\n\r\nAlicia is a woman who has had to work hard to raise her children. She is engaged in commerce: she sells clothing and jewelry of all kinds. She has a small space in her home, where many of her customers come to place their orders and purchases.  She also goes out into the city to sell her goods,  leaving her products on credit and receiving weekly payments.

The objective for her loan is to invest in working capital and to supply her business for buying and selling food products, so that in the not too distant future she will be able to obtain a better income. The communal bank Cristo Nos Ama thanks the Kiva lenders for the assistance they offer to people with limited resources and to poor countries like Nicaragua, so that people can find a way to work with dignity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5425,"image":{"id":1710007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

From this point, she decided to learn many courses in the dressmaking and sewing arts to start her own business inside her house through purchasing many sewing machines and sewing materials. \r\n\r\nNow Hanan is a professional tailor, and she has many customers. Unfortunately, she doesn't have the enough sewing equipment and materials to enlarge her business more. She needs financial support, but her parents do not have  enough money to support this. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Hanan applied for a Youth loan of 30,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more sewing materials such as fabrics, thread, zippers, and buttons in order to enlarge her business to be able to attract many customers.\r\n\r\nHanan looks forward to expanding her business more by opening a

way.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1702967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Islamic

She is from Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines, and she is one of the factory workers who benefits from CCT\u2019s employment assistance through Covenant Community Service Cooperative* and loan assistance through CCT Credit Cooperative.\r\n\r\nMaricel works as a garment production worker. She plays an important role in garment making processes from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging and shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Maricel is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maricel is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward for your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for their needs and expenses, and also to sustain the education of her children.\r\n\r\nMaricel wants to become more efficient in her field of work. She also hopes that her family will always stick together and has sufficiency in everything. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1714789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for their personal needs and household expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-20T12:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-19T12:20:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2242.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625601},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3363.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535745},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2242.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134092},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1121.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756859}],"funded_date":"2014-10-20T13:53:43Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":783992,"name":"Godfrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Godfrey age 50 years; he is a farmer engaging mainly in pineapple growing.

She has four children who are in college, high school and elementary school. She works hard to meet their daily household needs and for the schooling of her children.  \r\n\r\nEleonor is in the food business. She has been operating a canteen for a number of years already. In the Philippines, a canteen is a common sight, especially in populated areas. Working people usually buy their meals at a canteen, sold at reasonable prices for convenience and to save money rather than cooking at home. They eat their home-cooked meals at the end of the day with their family. \r\n\r\nEleonor is a good cook and that is why her canteen is popular in their area with neighbors and the local working community as her regular customers.  She earns a minimum of PHP 3,000 net income a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her maintain her business, Eleonor is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to buy additional raw ingredients like pork, fish, chicken and seasonings needed for her cooking. She believes that with this financial assistance, her sales and earnings will increase. She is thanking God in advance for your great help.\r\n\r\nEleonor dreams to build and expand her business to secure the education of her children. She wishes for her children to have a bright future. She prays for a happy and quiet life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1714792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Ducks are the sources of balut (a fertilized duck egg with a nearly-developed embryo inside that is boiled and eaten in the shell, considered a delicacy in the Philippines).

Salwa lives with her family in their own old house, which threatens to collapse at any time because it is very old.
