long-distance runners who have broken major world records. She is blessed with one child and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. On her farm, she grows maize and keeps a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize, and when she is not farming, Sharon offers transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction, despite meager earnings. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nSharon's biggest challenge is drought. The long, dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Sharon formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small, rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for \u201cbeautiful\u201d), which produces milk daily that Sharon sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Sharon. The money Sharon got from selling the milk was adequate to repay a loan. \r\n\r\nToday, Sharon is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her plan for the future is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Sharon is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and livelihood."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":469.12,"image":{"id":1714920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-20T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-19T17:10:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":3986.29,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4086.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823760},{"amount":43.58,"local_amount":3789.72,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3885.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262281},{"amount":40.94,"local_amount":3560.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3650.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264380},{"amount":44.94,"local_amount":3907.72,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4006.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600583},{"amount":88.22,"local_amount":7948.63,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8149.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.19,"payment_id":681377436},{"amount":47.34,"local_amount":4294.9,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4403.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.05,"payment_id":696587175},{"amount":45.54,"local_amount":4254.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4361.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.39,"payment_id":711505446},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":4519.77,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4633.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.6,"payment_id":731022289},{"amount":49.83,"local_amount":4531.58,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4645.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.28,"payment_id":752110561}],"funded_date":"2014-10-20T19:30:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":784080,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hearing a description of Alice can sound a lot like hearing someone describe your own mother.

She is from Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines and she has two children. She is one of the beneficiaries of the employment program of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nAlexandra is a Garment Production Worker. She plays an important role in garment making processes from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging and shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Alexandra is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Alexandra is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is deducted every payday. She looks forward for your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help to her. She will use the loan to redeem the ATM card that she pawned.\r\n\r\nAlexandra hopes to be always healthy and strong. She wants to give her children a better life and future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1714900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To reclaim her pawned ATM card.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-20T17:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-19T17:30:14Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2242.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625604},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3363.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535748},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2242.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134095},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1121.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756862}],"funded_date":"2014-10-20T18:11:54Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":784100,"name":"Zaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaida is 55 years old, married, and has four children.

Her native language is Aymara, and she does not use Spanish much because her whole community speaks Aymara. Her business is cheese production, and it varies according to the milk production of her cattle. Her house is made of adobe, like most of the houses, and she has water and electricity. Her children attend school; her husband works growing and harvesting the fields, which produce quinoa. She dreams of improving her family's quality of life by fixing her house. The rain season is coming and she needs to fix the roof of the room where her children sleep so water does not leak and they can rest warm. She also needs to fix her barn so her cows give milk and her cheese production is continuous. These are the reasons why Biatriz is requesting a loan in order to fix her adobe house so that her three children sleep warm. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1706260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to repair her adobe house so that her three children sleep warm.

Yosuman is a distance-learning student in her third year at Tajik National University, where she studies accounting with a focus in auditing.  She has no trouble balancing her studies with her job; she works as a loan officer with a microfinance organization, a position she's held for the past 8 months.\r\n\r\nYosuman wants to successfully graduate and become a highly-qualified specialist in her field.  Unfortunately, she has yet to pay her tuition for the year as she hasn't had enough money to do so.  As such, she is seeking a loan of $1,300 USD to pay for her tuition as well as buy some school supplies, and is counting on your

Sacatep\u00e9quez, Guatemala. The age range is from 21 to 57, and have an average education level of third grade of primary school. All the members of the group are indigenous Maya and wear the traditional dress of their town. Several of them speak Kaqchikel, one of the Mayan languages.  They all want very much to have a better life for their children. The mothers have worked hard to keep their children in school because they know how hard life is with little education.\nSeveral of the businesses involve making and selling food.  One woman buys and sells fruits and vegetables. Another buys and sells used clothing.  One sells the typical skirts and blouses of the area.  Another has a small store selling daily necessities. They are hard workers and dedicated women. They are eager to learn how to improve their businesses with the business training giving for Namaste.  They will receive classes in financial literacy and each will have a personal business adviser, who will help them to write a business plan and offer advice on how to grow their business to meet their goals.\n\nOne of these women, Nicolasa (first from left), is very entrepreneurial and has a small store that sells products for daily need for people in the neighborhood.  She is 57 years old, married, and has nine children.  She did not have the chance to go to school and therefore cannot read or write.  This situation is not keeping her away of hard work and progress in business.  She has worked in family businesses since she was very young and has had her own house for 20 years.

Meet Beatrice, a 40-year-old mother who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Cheborgei, a remote village in the Litein area of Kenya. She is happily married and has three children that depend on her for the basic needs. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her major primary sources of income are egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d She sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and, because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound, and the demand has been overwhelming. \r\n\r\nTo be able to meet the demand, she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity, and hence, satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nThe increased income level will be used in improving her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from the poultry manure, which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make her business flourish, and hence, provide a secure solid education to her

This is not true for Judith, 25, who is based in the Litein area of Kenya and is a mother of four lovely children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past 8 years and she has managed to earn a decent income. \r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\" Her hobby is milking Lelkina (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming and she cannot meet the demand. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margin and increased income levels. \r\n\r\nProfits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Judith is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also to start selling dairy products such as yoghurt.\r\n\r\nAn improved income level will assure her family of a secure future.

She is 17 years old and lives in the town of Iganga in the Iganga region of Uganda. She has no children. For the past year, Getrude has been working hard to manage her poultry business, raising chickens. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Getrude has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chicken feeds, drinkers and containers, and will help Getrude to generate greater profits and increase her chicken sales. She hopes that in the future she will be able to become self-dependent. \r\n\r\nGetrude is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is a smallholder farmer. She lives together with Frederick, her husband, in Mugwe village, which is located in central Kenya. Their 13-year-old marriage has been blessed with 4 children, the youngest being 4 and the oldest 13. They have managed to pay for their children to attend boarding schools so that they can focus on building a future of their own.\r\n \r\nPurity became a farmer in 2007 when she started making use of her husband's one acre piece of land. She has grown the farmstead to a sustainable and profitable state. This unrelenting farmer is seeking a loan to further boost productivity.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to purchase feeds for her animals. The feeds that she plans to acquire have a well-proportioned nutritional content that will help improve animal health and boost milk production. On the farm, she has one dairy cow, 8 poultry and one dairy goat that will benefit directly from this loan. \r\n\r\nPurity was born second to last in a family of 6 children. She was promising, but her education was cut short in the first year of high school.

The loan will be used to buy more sacks of charcoal, and will help Pauline to generate greater profits and pay medical bills. Pauline hopes that in the future, she will be able to open up a boutique. \r\n\r\nPauline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past three years, Sharifa has been working hard to manage her business selling charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sharifa has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more sacks of charcoal, and will help her to generate greater profits and to pay for rent. She hopes that in the future she will be able to complete her house. \r\n\r\nSharifa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and is a forum for life-skills

He couldn't keep on attending school because of his economic situation and lack of motivation.  He got married when he was 20.  His wife works with his mother making pupusas [stuffed tortillas]; she also helps with the household expenses with her earnings.  They live with \u00c1lvaro's parents, who also have a pupusa business.\r\n\r\n\u00c1lvaro used to work selling bread, but he opted for another source of income when a different job opportunity came up.  Now he drives a motorcycle taxi.  With this income, he supports his family and helps his parents financially as much as he can.  He has been in his new job for six months and has earned the trust of his boss.\r\n\r\nThe job didn't take a lot of effort because in his previous job he already knew a lot of people, who are also his customers now.  Every day he walks about 500 meters to where he gets the motorcycle taxi.\r\n\r\nThe loan he's requesting is to buy two grazing calves.  His parents have land that isn't being used and, to make the most of it, he decided to make the investment.  \r\n\r\nThe improvement from the loan will be being able to invest in something he can recover when necessary.  The need this will satisfy is being able to get started as a livestock manager so he can earn additional income.\r\n\r\nHe wants to always have his job and take care of it so he can get his family ahead.  He hopes to give his son an education to the extent possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1710124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to buy two grazing calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-10-20T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-19T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u00c1lvaro Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":37.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":51.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.24,"local_amount":26.24,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-20T10:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":562420999},{"amount":37.03,"local_amount":37.03,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":37.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545557},{"amount":38.3,"local_amount":38.3,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":38.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595145957},{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":39.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769493},{"amount":40.86,"local_amount":40.86,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":40.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833127},{"amount":317.62,"local_amount":317.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":317.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200896}],"funded_date":"2014-10-25T13:44:39Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":784180,"name":"Aish's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aish's group comprises two hard-working women.

Two of them are still at school, while the other two are grown ups.  She has been running several projects: a mamalishe project and a genge business since 2000.  She works from 05 am to 09 pm daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\n\nThis will be Agness's fourth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.

Like many other households in the village, they rely mainly on agricultural activities, in which cultivating rice is the most important production. However, rice cultivation cannot help to cover all living expenses of Tuoi's family. For that reason, she has diversified her business into planting vegetables and raising chickens and pigs, while her husband works extra for local construction employers. \r\n\r\nThis is the third time Tuoi has taken a loan from Anh Chi Em Program, and this time she will use the loan to buy small fish. Tuoi said that she felt the program's services were very helpful, because she not only received loan for her investment, but also training to make the investment become efficient. Despite plenty of difficulties ahead, Tuoi is very determined about her investment in fish farming. She dreams a better future will come to her daughter, that the girl will grow up in an abundant life, and study well and have a good job. \r\nIn the picture, Tuoi stands first from the right and wears

This place is known for being very dynamic and the majority of its inhabitants make a living from agriculture and breeding animals as it is an area with a lot of vegetation.\r\n\r\nRosa lives in this place. She is 41 years old and married. From her marriage, she has two children, who are 16 and 14 years old. They are both in high school. Her husband works at the local council.\r\n\r\nLike several people in the canton, Rosa makes a living by making sweet pastries, cakes and various sandwiches for parties. She makes her sweets for particular clients who order them for all their social engagements, and for selling in other cities. She generally has these engagements during the weekend. She has been doing this work for more than 16 years.

When you've been trained in this craft, it's difficult to leave it \u2013 I tell people this work is my vice. Ceramics are crafted by hand and not just anyone can do it well. When we started up, we didn't have money to buy a potter's wheel, so we made our own with material we had available in our houses. We brought boards and rulers and such. I got a door that wasn't in use, took it apart and brought it to the workshop. Even today, we continue using that wheel for our work.\r\n\r\n\"I was thrilled when I learned about the opportunity to receive this microcredit.

She is 58 years old and married. From her marriage, she has seven grown-up and independent children. Her husband makes a living from agriculture.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda, with the goal of earning some money and getting ahead in life, raises pigs and chickens. She has a pen where she feeds her little animals. She buys them when they are little; keeps them for a while; and, when they are ready, sells them to traders who come to her house to take them to other cities in order to slaughter them and sell their meat. In this way, she earns some money to help her and her husband to get ahead in life since her husband is frequently out of work.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for buying animal feed and medicine for the pigs and chickens. She has been with the communal bank for four years and she likes it because the loans always help her to get ahead in life.

They live in a semi-concrete house in Dhupguri.\r\n\r\nKrishna's husband works in a tea stall. His income is so little that it can hardly cover the household expenses and at the same time the educational expenses of their child. So to help her husband, Krishna runs an animal husbandry business.  She started this business a few years back.  She now has two sheep on her farm.  She buys baby sheep and raises them until they are grown and then sells them in her neighborhood and in the market. This way she gives financial support to her family. She wants to increase the number of livestock and improve the family's living condition by generating more income.\r\n\r\nSo Krishna has taken a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, who extends their helping hands to the needy rural woman to start a business.  She plans to purchase more sheep for her animal husbandry business.  She hopes this loan will give a boost to her business. The profit from her business will enable her to provide a better education to her children and a decent lifestyle to her family.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of upgrading their house to a concrete-made house in the future and so she is very much grateful to both of the lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1715097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a sheep for her animal husbandry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Krishna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-21T05:05:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":784240,"name":"Kausar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kausar is a married woman.

Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level.

She is from a small village, Altagram, in the district Jalpaiguri. She has completed her education up to grade 9.  She is married to Gauranga, aged 27 years. They are raising their two daughters together with love and care. One of their daughters attends school and reads in grade 2, and one is below school-going age. \r\n\r\nShefali's husband is a farmer. He grows green vegetables in his own farmland and sells to his neighbors. The income from their agribusiness is not sufficient to provide them financial sustenance. So for additional income, Shefali runs an animal husbandry business. She sells milk in her neighborhood.

lack of capital. This is true for Jane, 40, who is based in the Kapsowar area of Kenya and is the mother of four lovely children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past three years. She has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary sources of income are crop farming, dairy farming and personal business, and through these ventures she has been able to make ends meet. Jane and her family live in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and has good weather patterns that support farming activities. Jane is very enterprising, and through farming she has been able to support her family, although she has been facing challenges. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements that will assist her to produce more.

Mercy does crop farming and cattle keeping and she enjoys farming a lot. Her biggest challenges are the lack of finances to improve her farming and diseases. This has made her seek a loan of KES 25,000 to purchase a goat. With this goat, her projections are that by the end of the year the goat will have given birth to at least four other goats. Through goat keeping, she will be able to get goat skin, which is very expensive and fetches more profits. This translates to more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also, she will be able to sell goat meat which will increase her income level. The profits will be used to repay the loan on time and grow the

Meet Monica, 73 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer who is based in Kirege, a remote village in Chuka. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. Monica is happily married and blessed with six children. For the past 35 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Chuka area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. Monica is a member of Mukuria Rikaba Self-help Group and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. Through the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently. Profits from the loan will be used in repaying back the loan and increasing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1715121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.21,"local_amount":1707.75,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1712.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625301},{"amount":34.23,"local_amount":3043.04,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3051.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194460},{"amount":16.99,"local_amount":1509.78,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1514.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262286},{"amount":17.98,"local_amount":1598.46,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1603.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264387},{"amount":18.91,"local_amount":1680.66,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600589},{"amount":18.49,"local_amount":1643.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1648.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459071},{"amount":19.2,"local_amount":1768.09,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1773.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":681377442},{"amount":19.5,"local_amount":1807.73,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1813.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.84,"payment_id":696587181},{"amount":19.13,"local_amount":1826.41,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1831.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.42,"payment_id":711505451},{"amount":36.49,"local_amount":3414.73,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":731022295}],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T07:10:10Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":784267,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is a smallholder farmer based in Mugwe village in Central Kenya.

His girlfriend was very interested in Kawaii products, Japanese products that emphasize cuteness as their appeal. Jonathan says this is \u201ca niche market that has been lacking in organized stores.\u201d Given his web experience, Jonathan built a secure web platform (www.kawaiimiko.com) \u2013 with the added benefit of highlighting the work of Seven Sixteen Technologies.\r\n\r\nJonathan needs a loan to purchase bulk inventory. \u201cWe have been able to order some of it, but this loan will allow us to complete our inventory.\u201d Maintaining inventory has been the most difficult part of this business. Jonathan must meet minimum bulk orders to be able to resell for a profit. Ultimately, Jonathan wants the Kawaii store to be a self-sustaining showpiece for what Seven Sixteen Technologies can do. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1713310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for bulk inventory for his website","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Michigan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2730,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":120.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":128.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":131.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":132.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":133.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":138.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":140.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":141.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":143.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":145.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":147.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":149.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":151.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":153.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":155.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":157.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":159.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":161.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.07},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":784324,"name":"Ismael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ismael is a self-dependent young man living with his family that consists of five members in Irbid, Jordan. \r\n\r\nHe is a university student majoring in accounting, and he is in his third year.

Feliciana lives in Suai; she is married and has 5 children. Most of her daily income is from selling cows so she is still happy to operate her business. \r\n\r\nFeliciana started her business in 2001, with her own working capital of $1,000.

responsables y honradas, originarias de la misma comunidad donde desde 1937 se estableci\u00f3 uno de los ingenios de mayor producci\u00f3n de az\u00facar. Por lo anterior, la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes trabaja en el campo (sembrando, limpiando, cortando, la ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar), algunos laboran en el ingenio como obreros y otros m\u00e1s acarrean ca\u00f1a en temporada de zafra (cosecha). Tambi\u00e9n hay quienes salen a trabajar a otras ciudades para ofrecer a su familia un mejor futuro, pero tambi\u00e9n hay quienes se aventuran y establecen su propio negocio. Tal es el caso de los clientes del grupo llamado Las Palomas, quienes comentan que el nombre del grupo surgi\u00f3 por la libertad de volar y la belleza de esta ave.\n\nLos integrantes del grupo son:\nPerfecta - Venta De Ropa\nConcepci\u00f3n- Venta De Ropa \n\u00c1ngela - Venta De Calzado\nJos\u00e9 Luis- Venta De Bisuter\u00eda \nMargarita - Venta De Ropa\nSusana- Venta De Cosm\u00e9ticos\nSandra Luz- Venta De Calzado Por Catalogo \nAlba- Venta De Ropa\nNahum - Venta De Ropa\nGuadalupe- Venta De Cosm\u00e9ticos \nUleria- Venta De Antojitos\n\nNahum es un joven muy alegre, carism\u00e1tico, honesto, que ama  bailar. Ha ganado varios premios por ser quien mejor baila en las discos. Hace algunos a\u00f1os, cuando estudiaba la preparatoria concurs\u00f3 en la categor\u00eda de baile moderno y obtuvo el primer lugar. A pesar de que ama la danza, Nahum no se dedic\u00f3 a ella por el costo que genera y porque la econom\u00eda en casa no era muy estable.\n\nNahum inici\u00f3 la venta de ropa de manera ambulante desde hace ya 13 a\u00f1os, hoy en d\u00eda tiene un local en el centro de la comunidad. Con las ganancias obtenidas apoya a sus padres con el gasto de la casa, satisface necesidades personales e invierte en m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda. Nahum trabaja todos los d\u00edas con un horario de 10:00 am a 08:00 pm en el local que est\u00e1 instalado en la casa de su hermana quien lo apoya con el almuerzo y la cena.\n\n\u201cGracias VisionFund Mexico por brindarme la gran oportunidad de ser su cliente\u201d esas son las palabras de Nahum quien comenta que con el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado comprar\u00e1 pantalones, blusas, playeras y camisas para dama y caballero.\n\n*En la imagen: Nahum viste de playera color naranja y est\u00e1 parado sobre un banco.\n\n","en":"Las Palomas (the doves) is a group made up of 11, hard-working, friendly, responsible and honest members, who are all from the same community, where one of the most productive sugar refineries was established in 1937. Before, most of the population worked in the fields (cultivating, cleaning, or cutting sugar cane), while some worked in the refinery and others transported the sugar cane at harvest time. Some people left to work in other cities in order offer a better future to their families, and others took the risk of opening their own businesses. In the latter group are the members of Las Palomas, who point out that they chose their name for the bird\u2019s freedom of flight and beauty. \r\n\r\nThe members of this group are:\r\nPerfecta \u2013 sells clothing \r\nConcepci\u00f3n- sells clothing \r\n\u00c1ngela \u2013 sells shoes \r\nJos\u00e9 Luis- sells jewelry \r\nMargarita - sells clothing \r\nSusana- sells cosmetics\r\nSandra Luz- sells shoes through catalog \r\nAlba - sells clothing \r\nNahum - sells clothing \r\nGuadalupe- sells cosmetics\r\nUleria- sells snacks\r\n\r\nNahum is a joyful, charismatic and honest young man who loves to dance. He has won various prizes as the best dancer in discos. A few years ago, while studying his college preparatory course, he won first prize in the modern dance category in a competition. But despite his love for dancing, Nahum decided not to choose it as a profession because it entails a lot of expenses and his income would not be very stable. \r\n\r\nNahum started selling clothes in the street 13 years ago, and today has a shop in the center of town. With his earnings he helps his parents with household expenses, covers his personal needs, and invests in more stock. Nahum works every day from 10:00 am until 8:00 pm in his shop, which is set up in his sister\u2019s house. She helps by offering him lunch and dinner. \r\n\r\n\u201cThank you VisionFund Mexico for offering me the great opportunity to be your client \u201c, says Nahum, adding that with this loan he will buy pants, tops, t-shirts and button-down shirts for both men and women. \r\n\r\n*In the photo: Nahum is wearing an orange polo shirt and is standing on a bench.

She began her business with funds from her husband and has been carrying it out for nine years now. This new loan will be used to buy four sacks of beans. She would like thereby to increase her capital as well as to educate, clothe and feed her children.

Thanks to Kulsyina\u2019s extremely hard work and patience, presently she has a good farm, with two dairy cows and two horses. She sells dairy products locally. Delicious farm milk is in great demand, which is why Kulsyina has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance association for a loan in the amount of 150,000 KGS to buy dairy cows. At present her income falls critically short of what she needs to support herself, even  though her children send her money. The revenue from selling milk and dairy products will allow Kulsyina to develop her business further and improve her quality of life.

This will help her earn additional income by selling water, because few people in the community have water service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1710191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to finish the walls of her well","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Buenos Aires - Morropon - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":140.15},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":142.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":149.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":148.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":160.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":173.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":179.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":185.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":190.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":195.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.91},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.05,"local_amount":140.15,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":142.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561644499},{"amount":49.91,"local_amount":142.6,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":145.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579554784},{"amount":52.19,"local_amount":149.1,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":151.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595155323},{"amount":330.84,"local_amount":945.25,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":962.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611778028},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":184.55,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":187.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624841973},{"amount":153.42,"local_amount":438.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":446.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636211473}],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T03:32:15Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:23:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":784580,"name":"Cerila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cerila, 55 years old, is married and has six children, two of them in school.

The city is rich with the ancient traditions of high culture. Musharaf is one of the residents who maintains many of the national symbols of the people by sewing kurpa and kurpacha, which are types of cotton mattresses.

The people from the town where he lives are progressive and mainly work in agriculture or with cattle. Santos Evelio goes to work every day with a lot of love. He currently works as the Assistant Director of Inatec. Previously he worked for a micro finance company. He has a lot of professional knowledge and ever since he was little he has liked working. \r\n\r\nSantos comes from a humble and very hardworking family who work with cattle and grow tubers. Santos also gains an income by selling the tubers that he produces on a lot of land that belongs to his brother. This income will be put back into his business and will be used at home to feed his family well. \r\n\r\nSantos Evelio's home is very beautiful, but of course there are always improvements to be made. His last loan with Afodenic was used to buy a plot of land where he can build a home for one of his children when they grow up, or to set up a business. The loan before that which was issued through Kiva was used to whitewash walls and add a door which the house really needed. Now his family can enjoy safety and comfort in their home. \r\n\r\nSantos needs this loan to build a ditch on the street up to his house so he can take a look at the pipes which are currently causing problems. The pipes are leaking water and the water is not getting to his house so he needs to replace the damaged pipes. With this investment his family enjoy the vital liquid without having to disturb their neighbour, which is what they are currently doing. \r\n\r\nSantos will continue making home improvements so he can see his house finished and completely set up. After that he will start building a home on his plot of land as he already has two children and he wants to leave them each with a home, God willing. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1710243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy pipes and pay for the cost of labour to repair pipes which are leaking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nueva Guinea, RAAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Evelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":781154,"name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Nyabulohwe est commer\u00e7ante, pr\u00e9sidente de la banque communautaire J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima, mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un \u00e9vang\u00e9liste, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 46 ans, m\u00e8re de 6 enfants scolaris\u00e9s.
