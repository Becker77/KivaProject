She has also previously borrowed from CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.

He lives in GMA, Cavite, Philippines with his wife and two children. He has been in the service for almost a year now through the aid of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nRichard works as a garment manufacturing supervisor. He directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters, operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators. \r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Richard, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Richard is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to any loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in returning the money since the loan payments were being deducted every payday. He looks forward to your positive response and any assistance from you will surely be of great help. He will utilize the loan to pay for his housing expenses and also to provide other needs of his family.\r\n\r\nRichard desires to give his family a better life and he also hopes for his children to finish their studies. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

experienced first-hand the benefits they provide. She lost almost 20 pounds while taking Herbalife meal-replacement shakes and instantly became an evangelist for the product, becoming an independent distributor while working full-time.\r\n\r\nAfter working as an assistant to the Brazilian Ambassador to the US in New York for several years, she moved to San Diego to be near her family, but had a hard time finding work. She ended up taking a few different jobs and worked at restaurants, while growing her Herbalife business. \r\n\r\nHer Herbalife mentor, a very successful local distributor, eventually suggested that she open a health center featuring Herbalife products. She took his challenge to heart, and in March opened a small shop where she sells meal replacement shakes and teas, and also holds regional Herbalife meetings, health workshops, and several different exercise camps. She has invested quite a bit of her own money into the business and is already able to bring in consistent revenues.  \r\n\r\nShe recently sought out a Kiva loan to help purchase additional inventory to ensure she always has an adequate stock of product for her growing health center. She also used a portion of her funds to upgrade her signage and for marketing expenses.\r\n\r\nAs her business grows, she hopes to inspire other Herbalife distributors to open their own centers around the city and continue to spread the culture of health and wellness that she is so passionate about.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1715462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional inventory and upgrade her shop signage.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Diego","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":249,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":144,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":154.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":176.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":181.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":182.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":184.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":193.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":190.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":195.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":196.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":201.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":202.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":205.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":210.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":212.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":216.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":218.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227.03},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":228.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":232.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":235.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":243.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":246.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.86},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.92},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.2},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":782243,"name":"Djiguisseme Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"DJIGUISSEME est un groupe de l\u2019association DAMBE de SEGUESSONA.

It groups together women who met each other through relatives and neighbors. They are on average 29 years old. They are married and have, on average, four children. They run different businesses, like buying and selling clothes, as does KADIATOU, who is the person standing to the far left in the photo. They all live in large traditional families in SEGUESSONA, which is one of the villages in OUELESSEBOUGOU, a rural commune in the prefecture of KATI (KOULIKORO region, Republic of Mali). They have been running small businesses for several years and are well sought-after in their clothing businesses: ready-to-wear and second-hand clothing. In their concern with satisfying the growing need of their clientele, the group members decided to integrate Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s loan program. They are on their first group loan.\r\n\r\nKADIATOU, who is the president of the group and well known in SEGUESSONA, excels at selling clothing.

Teresita has been employed at a garment factory in Cavite for almost two years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nTeresita is a production worker. She is responsible for garment making processes from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging and shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Teresita, is the difficulty of balancing their salaries and family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has caused many of them to become heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Teresita is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she has had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments are being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response, and any help from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan for the payment of her motorcycle.\r\n\r\nTeresita wants to improve the general living condition of her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before they start their daily work routines. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1715619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for her motorcycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":2083.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2149.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625608},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4298.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535752},{"amount":143.76,"local_amount":6249.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6447.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134099},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4298.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756866},{"amount":95.82,"local_amount":4166.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4298.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200032},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":4166.7,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4298.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186369}],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T04:52:41Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":784661,"name":"Soy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local farmer from Kampong Cham province, Soy is 52 years old and a mother of six children.

She is 40 years old and lives in Fayzabad, a village located 50 kilometers east of the city Dushanbe. Shodigul lives with her husband and two children, who are already grown. Her son is working in Russia and her daughter helps her with the sewing business. It has been 17 years since Shodigul started sewing. She takes orders for traditional women's dresses.

She specializes mostly in interior decoration. She has been helping her husband with household obligations. \n\nBefore coming to Thrive, business for her was low. This was because she did not have enough capital to buy materials to meet her demand. She also lacked business management skills that she obtained from the training offered at Thrive. After receiving her first loan, Lizzy was able to double her revenue. With her savings she also purchased an industrial sewing machine for her business and this has enabled her to achieve better efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nWith the Kiva loan, she hopes to get more materials and an assistant so she can be able to take on bigger jobs as her business is expanding.

He has a wife he has been married to for 15 years, and the product of their love is three children, the eldest being 30 and the youngest being 6. He has been farming for over a decade. He keeps two cows and six hens that give him milk and eggs for food and to sell. He also grows tea, vegetables, and banana. To supplement his main income sources, Gitari also trades cereals. \r\nThe cereals business has really picked up. His name is out there, and the demand is increasingly becoming too much for him to fulfill. Gitari is seeking a loan to replenish his cereal stock. \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to purchase more cereals in order to fulfill the overflowing demand.

The vegetables and tea that he grows on his one acre farm provide him with a reliable income. He also sells milk and eggs from the animals he keeps.\r\n \r\nKipkoech enjoys looking after his cow. He also spends a lot of time on his tea farm, picking tea leaves, something he admits is very strenuous but his eyes are riveted on the dollar. He makes good money selling tea to factories. The problem is that he has limited land to expand this operation.\r\n \r\nKipkoech is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 for leasing land and buying fertilizer. The additional land he will acquire through a lease agreement will give him enough space to plant more tea. Since he will be scaling up, he will also rely on the loan to buy farm inputs that do not come cheap, such as fertilizer. \r\n\r\nWhen asked how this loan will be of benefit to his family, Kipkoech replied, \"My nuclear family will have a chance to enjoy better standards of living because of enhanced cash flows.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1715714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to lease land and purchase farm inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-21T22:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-20T22:40:13Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kipkoech","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.77,"local_amount":4779.95,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4971.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625305},{"amount":26.97,"local_amount":2312.08,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2404.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194467},{"amount":54.81,"local_amount":4697.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4885.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262292},{"amount":57.71,"local_amount":4946.38,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5144.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600595},{"amount":59.99,"local_amount":5327.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5541.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.17,"payment_id":681377448},{"amount":86.15,"local_amount":7936.25,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8254.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.43,"payment_id":711505457}],"funded_date":"2014-10-29T13:07:33Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":784742,"name":"Pantaleo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pantaleo is a fifty-eight-year-old, hard-working man living in Kamwenge, Uganda.

Es abuelo de tres nietos, quienes viven con el, cuando sus nietos no est\u00e1n en la escuela le acompa\u00f1an al monte y a\u00fan cuando para ellos es como un paseo,  Rogelio aprovecha para familiarizarlos en el oficio de la resinaci\u00f3n. \n\nPara Rogelio la resina ha sido su \u00fanico ingreso durante toda su vida, ya que por un tiempo trabajo en la sierra de Arteaga, a seis horas de su casa, como instructor de resineros. Este pr\u00e9stamo lo utilizar\u00e1 para establecer con su familia las primeras plantaciones de pinos resineros en la regi\u00f3n. Con las plantaciones resineras planea dejarle a su familia la seguridad de tener un ingreso  econ\u00f3mico permanente para que las futuras generaciones puedan vivir en mejores condiciones familiares. Rogelio, est\u00e1 orgulloso de su trabajo,  ya que el oficio de resinero le da la posibilidad de valerse por si mismo y ser el patr\u00f3n de su propio negocio. \n\nEl saber que hay gente alrededor del mundo que est\u00e1 dispuesta a ayudarle con su proyecto lo hace sentir contento y les gustar\u00eda compartirles a todas estas personas que est\u00e1 dispuesto a trabajar con mucho entusiasmo. En su opini\u00f3n la resina apoya al medio ambiente, ya que permite conservar los montes (las  tierras) con bosques, para \u00e9l los pinos son la vida. Como en cada actividad hay retos que se tienen que enfrentar y Rogelio platica que lo m\u00e1s complicado para \u00e9l, son los largos recorridos que tiene que hacer para recolectar la resina.  Sin embargo, le gusta m\u00e1s platicar de las cosas positivas, por lo que considera que el clima de la regi\u00f3n donde vive favorece la producci\u00f3n de la resina y es una oportunidad para que todos los integrantes del grupo puedan usar el pr\u00e9stamo para plantar 32,000 pinos resineros y poco a poco incrementar la superficie de los huertos resineros.\n\n \n\n\n\n","en":"To find out more about how Ejido Verde is working to create opportunity for indigenous populations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SM2xd2GyDH8&feature=youtu.be\">watch this video<\/a>\n\nRogelio is the representative for the group \u201cResineros de San Jos\u00e9 de Ca\u00f1as\u201d.  He is married and his wife takes care of their home.  He has three children:  Rogelio, Bel\u00e9n, and Valeria.  Rogelio is also a grandfather to three grandchildren who live with him.  When they are not in school, Rogelio's grandchildren will accompany him to the mountain, which seems like going for a walk to them.  However, Rogelio takes advantage of this opportunity to teach them about the trade of resin tapping.  <br \/><br \/>For Rogelio, resin is the only source of income that he has known his entire life.  One time he worked as a resin tapping instructor in the Arteaga Mountains, which is six hours away from his house.  This loan will be used by him and his family to establish the first pine resin plantation in the region.  By having these pine trees, his family will be left with permanent financial security for future generations that will enable them to live under better conditions.  Rogelio is proud of his work.  The vocation of a resin tapper gives him the opportunity to support himself and also become the boss of his own business.  <br \/><br \/>Knowing that there are people from all over the world who are willing to help with this project gives him a sense of happiness.  He would like to share that feeling with everyone who is willing to work with great enthusiasm.  In his opinion, the resin industry helps the environment because it preserves the mountains, the land, and the forests.  For him, these pine trees are his life.  With any business, there are challenges that have to be faced.  Rogelio says that the most complicated challenges for him are the long trips that are required to gather the resin.  However, he would rather enjoy talking about positive things, such as the climate of the region that is favorable to resin production.  <br \/><br \/>All group members will use their loan to plant pine trees. Collectively, Resineros del San Jos\u00e9 de Ca\u00f1as will plant 32,000 pine trees, which will gradually increase the area of the pine forest."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":29050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1699201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Flexible Credit Study","Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"to buy and plant resin producing pine trees.

He is very expert in his profession; he is especially famous for bridal dresses. People like his art and appreciate his efforts. \r\n\r\nHe wants to meet the demand for bridal dresses. That is why he wants to buy stock of threads, fancy cloth, sequins, and pearls of various colours in advance. For this purpose, he requires some capital to buy desired inventories, but he does not have sufficient cash on hand. Therefore, Samina made this humble request to BRAC Pakistan for a loan. Through this loan her husband will be able to buy stock of threads, fancy cloth, sequins, and pearls of various colours. \r\n\r\nSamina is very glad and thankful to BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1715702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded

","en":"Farhod is 26 years old. He lives in the countryside as a farmer. Since childhood he has taken care of livestock and has inherited his father's love for animals. In Farhod's youth his father, also a farmer, gifted his son with two lambs and Farhod reared them himself. When the sheep were fully grown he sold them and bought more lambs, which was the start of his business. As Farhod is currently in need of money, he has turned to \"Arvand\" for help.

He will be able to chaff hay that would last the cow for weeks all at once. A chaff cutting machine also produces a much better quality of work than human hands because the hay is cut into ideal and almost identical sizes. This makes the cows enjoy their meal and in turn thank Moses by producing more milk.

She is 40 years old. She lives with her sisters and brothers in the Shahrituz region. This is her second loan. She took out a two year, 1000 dollar loan in the past and it was a huge help for her.

As he always liked animals, Kosim started supplementing his salary by raising livestock. He used his first loan to purchase two sheep and was able to sell the animals at the local market for a profitable price after 6 month of care. Kosim has a son, Mamalatif. He is a freshman in college. Kosim found out from Arvand about loans to finance tuition. He wants to take out such a loan to pay for his son's college tuition.

He lives in a village, so to feed his large family Fatkhullo works three different jobs. He is a construction worker who builds and repairs private houses and larger buildings. This work requires a great deal of physical labor. Fatkhullo also works in a barber shop and as a taxi driver. He is frequently tired, but still works overtime whenever he can. All of this he does for the sake of his family, for Fatkhullo wants his children to grow up in comfort. He also is saving money for tuition, as he wants to give his kids a good college education. He also needs to repair his home, but lacks money for this. That is why Fatkhullo has turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan.

With PHP 25,000, she can purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She will also use a portion of the loan to pay for the maintenance of their tricycle. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Regina wants to buy another unit of tricycle, which they can also use for transportation services. She also desires to have some home renovation. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

Things don't just come on their own, you have to stand up and reach for them yourself.\r\n\r\nSantos, 62, decided this was true despite his advanced age and made the decision to work to generate income for the benefit of his family.  He has 4 sons and 3 daughters who are all residents of Solol\u00e1.\r\n\r\nHe works with dignity under the tiring sun as a day laborer in the community where he lives.  People in his community seek him out to do various kinds of work, which allows him to bring in income to support his family.

On the farm, Armenuhi keeps pigs and cultivates tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers. To be able to invest in the farm and cover some urgent costs, Armenuhi has requested this loan. She plans to use it to repair the truck, which helps her husband to transport the gathered harvest to market and sell it there. The loan will be also used for covering harvest gathering costs to pay for hired workers. \r\n\r\nArmenuhi received a prior loan from a local financial institution but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. Thanks to her hard work in recent times, Armenuhi has been able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments.

This group is made up of women who know each other through the bonds of family and community. On average, each group member is 42 years, married, with an average of two children each. They each carry out different activities, such as buying and selling cosmetic products. This is the main source of income for Mariam, the woman sat to the left of the photo. These women all live within large traditional families in Bamananking, one of the districts of Ouelessebougou, a rural commune within Kati Prefecture (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nThese women have worked in small-scale retail for several years and are very much sought-after for the cosmetic products they trade in, such as perfume, hair extensions, ointments and incense. In order to satisfy their customers' growing needs, the members of this group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso Lending Scheme two years ago. This will be their fifth group loan.\r\n\r\nMariam, who is the group's president and who is very well known around Ouelessebougou, excels in selling cosmetic products. She plans on using her part of the loan to purchase a large quantity of different cosmetic products, such as perfumes, ointments and traditional deodorants. She gets her supplies in Bamako from the wholesalers there and sells these items in Ouelessebougou in exchange for both cash and credit to a mixed customer base.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn a monthly profit of 35,000 FCFA, which will allow her to pay back the loan and reinvest into her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1712281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase cosmetic products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-10-22T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-21T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenimba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caroline Y","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":34454.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793628},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34454.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758498},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":34454.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319097},{"amount":65.76,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":34454.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.9,"payment_id":610752852},{"amount":60.64,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":34454.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.02,"payment_id":624542610},{"amount":61.45,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34454.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.22,"payment_id":636515635}],"funded_date":"2014-10-24T06:01:25Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Smith","image":null}},{"id":784858,"name":"Humera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Humera is 23 years old and single.

In this area, hard-core poverty pervades every homestead, yet every day when you look beyond the numbers, you will see a sea of people: a sea of about 50,000 bright, vibrant, open faces, searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it is possible. They are like the bones in the \u201cvalley of dry bones\u201d that required only a breath to spring back to life. \r\n\r\nGilbert, 34, is a small-holder farmer who has been practicing mixed farming on a small inherited piece of land. Gilbert is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. He is a role model, mentor, and an inspiration to many youths in the Litein area due to his resilience to personal challenges and his passion to serve his fellow youth and one child as a primary caregiver.\r\n\r\nBack in 2002, Gilbert practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was doing only 1\/4 an acre of maize crop per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely survive. He kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2008, when he switched to tea, poultry and dairy farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for Gilbert. \r\n\r\nToday, Gilbert is arguably the most successful client of Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance institution that deals only with small-holder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. He is a full-fledged entrepreneur, having already serviced four asset-based loans. Through the loans he has acquired a motor vehicle that he uses to transport farm produce from the farm to the market.\r\n\r\nTo capitalize more on returns from the booming tea, dairy and poultry farming, Gilbert is seeking a loan of KES 300,000 to buy land. Through the loan he will be able to expand his tea plantation, have enough space to keep more poultry and dairy cows so as to meet the overwhelming demand he has.\r\n\r\nThe Litein area has a ready market for milk, poultry, and tea and a large population. Hence, Gilbert will not have a problem selling the products and increasing his income level. Gilbert is much disciplined with finances and he is sure that, through accumulated profits, he will buy more land and be able to pay the loan on time.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Gilbert is going to improve his living conditions and also improve the conditions of his child by providing him with a solid education, because education is the \u201ckey to success.\u201d \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1715830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-22T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-21T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5767.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9150.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9418.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9693.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":9976.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10268.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10568.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10877.07},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11194.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11522.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11858.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12205.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":12562.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":12929.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":13307.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":13696.03},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14096.29},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14508.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14932.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15368.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15817.85},{"due_date":"2016-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16280.08},{"due_date":"2016-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16755.87},{"due_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":17245.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.9},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.95},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.15},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":784873,"name":"Farzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farzana is a 39-year-old, married woman and a mother of three children.

On closer look, the free-range hens on the farm were busy wandered about fending for themselves, laying eggs, hatching chicks, dropping manure on his farm and also aerating the soil while looking for bugs. He started treating poultry farming not as a subsistence activity, but as a business. \r\n\r\nAlbert is seeking a loan to acquire more poultry. This is in a bid to scale the poultry business into a big business. Additional income from the investment will go to his children's school fees and other family expenses.

Meet Jeremiah from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile. Jeremiah is 32 years old and a proud father of two lovely angel-looking children whom he really adores and cherishes. Other than doing some small business, Jeremiah is a very hardworking farmer who has been farming for the past two years. He has gained so much experience through those years of farming. \r\n\r\nJeremiah practices mixed farming. That is, he grows maize and keeps poultry, and through these activities he has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion he has for farming, he has even nicknamed one of his chickens Lelmet. He really enjoys taking care of his poultry. \r\n\r\nAlthough Jeremiah has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. His farm has not been producing as much of a harvest because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why he is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES to be able to buy farm implements. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Jeremiah will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, Jeremiah will reap more, which will assure him of comfortably taking care of his family and repaying the loan.

He is married to Jocelyn and they have children. Efren has been working as a factory worker since 2012 through the help and assistance of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\n\nEfren is part of the Garment Production Department. He is responsible for garment making processes from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging, and shipping.\n\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Efren is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \n\nFor this reason, Efren is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to any loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every payday.  He looks forward to your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. He will be using the loan for the renewal of license of his motorcycle and also he will buy items that fill the immediate needs of his family, especially his children.\n\nEfren desires to always meet the needs of his family and he is hoping to give her children a better future. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work. \n\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\n\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1714860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To provide for the needs of his family and to renew license of his motorcycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-22T17:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-21T17:40:16Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2238.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625603},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535747},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2238.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134094},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1119.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756861}],"funded_date":"2014-10-22T19:33:59Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":784612,"name":"Maria Nena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria Nena makes a living through her bamboo furniture business.

This gives him a better yield and he can raise potatoes for the benefit of his community and his family, as a source of income.\r\n\r\nThe investment he will make with the new loan is to buy chemical and organic fertilizers, because these are very important for his potato production, in order to have a good harvest for his family and his community.\r\n\r\nThe changes that have taken place in Natividad\u2019s life due to his loans, and which he is very proud of, are having a better income in order to improve the living conditions of himself and his family, and getting better harvests for his community.\r\n\r\nOne of Natividad\u2019s aspirations is to expand his potato fields in order to have better income in the future, and to give his children an education so that they can be good professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1711016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chemical and organic fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-10-22T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-21T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natividad ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":0.7,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":0.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579463969},{"amount":0.41,"local_amount":3.1,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070648},{"amount":0.12,"local_amount":0.93,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":0.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624776890},{"amount":0.72,"local_amount":5.52,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134198},{"amount":523.66,"local_amount":3989.75,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4013.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489320}],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T11:11:49Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:06:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":784777,"name":"Ran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ran\u2019s group live in a rural village in Battambang province in Cambodia.

In fact, mothers from all over the camp come to his shop because his prices are reasonable and flexible and his clothes are suitable for all family members. \n\nAli is applying for a 3,083,000 Lebanese pounds loan for the first time from Kiva field partner Ibdaa. The loan will allow him to increase his stocks in kids clothes, women clothes and towels. He will also be able to serve new customers and reach new areas in the camp which will increase his income and fulfill his ambition of seeing his business grow.

In fact, her husband works as a tailor and four of her children also started working after graduating from school to support their parents and brothers and sisters. \nEntisar established her own business two years ago. She owns a grocery store in a very popular street of the camp, which attracts a lot of clients during rush hours in addition to her competitive prices. \nShe is asking for a 1,543,992 Lebanese pounds loan for the first time from Kiva partner Ibdaa.

These women all live within large traditional families in Tiele, within Baguineda Sub-Prefecture (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nThese women have been carrying out this work for several years and are very much sought-after for the goods they trade in, such as meats, beans and rice.

This will be their ninth group loan.\r\n\r\nMassire, who is the group's president and who is very well-known around Tiele, excels in running her food stall. She plans on using her part of the loan to purchase two sacks of rice and a large quantity of meats, cabbages and pepper. She gets her supplies in Bamako and sells these items in Tiele in exchange for both cash and credit to a customer base made up of both men and women.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn a monthly profit of

She lives in Nkubu, a small remote rural town in Kenya that has bad terrain and is characterized by drought and bad weather conditions. For the past 10 years, Stella has been actively involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income is from milk and crop farming. Stella loves dairy farming and has nicknamed one of her cows \u201cKaremba.\u201d Milking Karemba is her hobby and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Dairy farming is very fulfilling for Stella. She faces the challenge of irrigating her farm and providing water to her animals. Nkubu is a remote area without piped water or electricity. \r\n\r\nSince Stella is from a marginalized community, she is forced to walk long distances to search for water. She typically walks for two hours. Therefore, Stella is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the rain water in his area goes to waste and Stella wants to harvest the water and store it in a water tank. The loan will save Stella time and allow her to irrigate her farm during dry seasons and increase her productivity. The increase in productivity will translate into more income, which will provide her with financial security. Stella will also use the stored water for home consumption. Stella\u2019s dream is to increase her farming activities and provide her children with a proper education. Education is the only way that her children, who are from a marginalized community, can

The more chicken and pork displayed at her stall, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. The profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes to become more successful in her business and she wants to have expansions too.

The above picture presents David, an ever-smiling, hardworking and honest man. He is happily married and is blessed with two angels looking like children. Being still young and full of energy, he has been practicing farming for the past five years, and has been making profits. His farming involves feeding and attending to his animals. His primary source of income is selling eggs, maize, vegetables and some small business he does to make ends meet. When asked what\u2019s the most enjoyable bit about farming he answered, \u201cI get food to eat and to sell\u201d. \r\n\r\nDavid has an expansive land, and has planted enough Napier grass. He has always wanted to buy a good dairy breed of cow, but the challenge he has been facing is a lack of finances. That is why he is seeking funds to make his dream a reality.

She gives her business 8 hours a day to be able to get income to sustain her family. She started her business in Kyamuhunga, Igara, Bushenyi District. Her main objective for starting her business was to generate income to look after her family and educate her children.
