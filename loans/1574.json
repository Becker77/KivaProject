She has since been using the larger part of her house as the pre-school. \n\nShe has experienced ups and downs in the running of the pre-school as well as in the enrollment numbers and this has been largely due to lack of adequate working capital. She currently has 60 children enrolled. Mary has also managed to help orphans in her society. She has about 20 orphans that she is educating at half the fees.\n\nMary is looking forward to building a proper structure for the preschool where she will be able to accommodate more children than at present.

She also sells them to her neighbors and other people that live in the area.

children. She has a specialized secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which provide an additional source of income to her family.  She started in this field 19 years ago when she bought her first livestock.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns three cows, 20 sheep and two horses, and she also grows potatoes for resale on a plot of leased land measuring  1.86 hectare.  She makes close to 10,000 som (KGS) every month.  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase 12 sheep.  Yryskan plans to re-invest the profits from her loan into further increasing her activity.  She would also like to save enough money to repair her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1715869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 12 sheep to fatten and resale.

She is married to Roame and has six children. Two of her children are in High School, two are in Elementary School and the other two are not of school age yet. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal household needs and to send her four children to school. \r\n\r\nMirasol operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food.  She earns a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells firewood used for cooking. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 300 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a Php 8000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items which are mostly biscuits and some peanut butter. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their income source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nMirasol hopes to maintain and grow her business so they could have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1716064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery food items to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-23T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-22T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirasol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.02,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3594.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625615},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2396.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535759},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134106},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1198.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756873}],"funded_date":"2014-10-23T03:32:24Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:09:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":785024,"name":"Nedalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nedalyn is a 24-year-old woman from Carles, Iloilo.

Her husband works in agriculture.<br \/><br \/>Francisca is a good mother and housewife who also works by raising pigs. She hopes to buy some small pigs to feed them for 5 to 6 months. Then, when they're ready, she sells them to vendors from her home. She will give part of the loan to her husband who works in agriculture. They have plantain crops. Right now, they're working on cleaning the plantains, which is why they urgently need the loan.<br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to buy pigs as well as pay for labor to clean the crops.

He has four children, and has been doing mixed-farming for 14 years.  His primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea, and earnings from side-businesses.\r\n\r\nWilliam enjoys milking. Milking to him is a hobby by itself. However, he has not been milking since his cow was pregnant. The cow delivered, but he is still sparing the milk for the calf. This whole situation has had an effect on his livelihood. His own family has not been getting much milk, and also his income has been cut. \r\n\r\nWilliam is seeking a loan to purchase a highly productive dairy cow. The cow will produce more milk than that which an average cow can produce in a day. This will get him back on his feet after months of low income. Having an additional cow will also cushion him against losses associated with such scenarios in the future. \r\n\r\nReturns from this investment will help him to meet some of the high farming-related costs. When he was asked how his family will benefit if he was granted this loan, he said, \"The loan will increase the number of my dairy animals. I will use the returns to build a dairy unit that will boost my milk production.

He would like to invest in the purchase of sterling silver earring hooks for his designs.\n\nHugo has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is his story:\n\n\"I was born and raised by loving parents in the department of Peten. Dad was a welder and I loved watching him work. I started working with him when I finished elementary school. When I was 15, I went to live with my uncle in Belize. He was such an amazing artisan! He taught me how to make things from what he found on the beach: coral, seashells, and more. He taught me how to make sculptures, jewelry, and decorative items from them. \n\nBy the time I was 17 years old, I was already designing my own jewelry and when I was 20, my uncle encouraged me to start working on my own. I love handicrafts and I love what I do. My primary material is usually what people don't use, burn, or throw away, such as bull horns or cow bones, as well as chapay wood. It's impressive how waste can become a beautiful sculpture or an elegant piece of jewelry.

Her business grew with two activities in parallel: poultry farming and small industry. She makes curtains, cushions, quilts, bath toys, bags, and many other things. Also, her work raising and growing chickens is continuing; the demand is good. She always maintains chickens in different stages of their growth. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in saw materials, such as fabric, thread, elastic, lace, and other materials for sewing, since she has many order for curtains and quilts, which sell very well because of the cold weather at the end of the year.

They live in a small house which is made of mud, bamboo and straw and is lacking the basic amenities like water connection and electricity.\r\n\r\nRuna's husband, Jiyarul, aged 34 years, works in a small cycle shop, but his income is low. Runa acknowledges the fact that the income from her husband's business is barely enough to meet the daily expenses. With three young kids to take care of and to provide them with good education, she started to rear cattle. She purchased a cow and supplies milk to her neighbors. Despite her childhood being ruined, as she could not get good education and only attended school till grade 7, she never gave up her fighting spirit and became financially independent. She is a young courageous woman who is willing to work harder.\r\n\r\nShe seeks a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy a dairy cow and to increase her milk-supply business. One more cow means more milk to supply; thus, she can earn more profit.

This group consists of 15 micro-entrepreneurs located in the city of San Pedro de Macoris, where Ezequiel makes his home in a simple structure with his long-term partner and one of his nine children. His most difficult challenge consists of working hard to provide for his family and support his children. \r\n\r\nEzequiel has sold food for around five years, having started the business with his own savings. He is running a food store called a colmado, where he sells goods for daily meals to his neighbors. \r\n\r\nHe is excited to be taking his fifth loan with Esperanza International, with which he will use to purchase rice, beans, sugar, cooking oil, vegetables, flour, etc. Ezequiel will reinvest the profits in his business to improve it more and save some for any family needs that may arise. He also wants to save and have a prosperous business. \r\n\r\nHe thanks all of you for your support.

businessman. Currently pursuing an associate\u2019s degree in accounting, Christopher was crunching the numbers on several potential business ventures when he began to consider auto detailing. He noted the low overhead, with high margins and fixed expenses that can be resold for 50% of full retail were the business to go under. Despite his inexperience in the industry, Christopher decided to pursue the business.\r\n\r\nChristopher likes to throw himself headlong into a new venture, and he isn\u2019t afraid to face novel challenges. In addition to being an outsider to the auto detailing industry and facing stiff competition from established businesses run by experienced professionals, his main challenge has been in marketing and getting his name out. Rather than being discouraged by these difficulties, Christopher sees them as learning experiences, and he is always on the lookout for new ways to get new customers without being overly aggressive.\r\n\r\nChristopher initially sought business financing not because he didn\u2019t have the cash on hand to self-finance, but as an opportunity to learn how larger businesses run in a smaller-scale environment. He will use his Kiva loan to purchase necessary equipment, including a power washer, power generator, vacuum, water tank, and soaps, as well as to pay licensing costs. \r\n\r\nWith the help of generous Kiva lenders, Christopher will embark on a lifetime of learning and entrepreneurship."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1716364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

is a factory worker. She is from Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines and she has two children. She is one of the beneficiaries of the employment program of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nWinny works as a Garment Production Worker. She plays an important role in the garment making process, from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging and shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Winny is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Winny is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for her children\u2019s educational needs and other expenses.\r\n\r\nWinny hopes to be always healthy and strong.  She wants to give her children a better life and future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1716480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

She has a child and she is working in a garment factory. She was employed through the assistance of Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nLyneth is a Quality Control Officer. She inspects garments, such as men's denim bottoms, during manufacturing operations to determine the number of defects per worker and reasons for rejects by examiners. She counts the number of pattern parts, layers of cloth prior to cutting, number of stitches per inch during sewing operations and collects other measurement knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Lyneth, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collaterals. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Lyneth is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan for her child\u2019s education and also to help her extended family who is in need.\r\n\r\nLyneth wants to be always efficient and productive in her workplace. She dreams of giving her family a better future through all her hard work. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.

Su compa\u00f1era de vida se dedica a los quehaceres del hogar y a cuidar sus hijos mientras que Armando se dedica a atender clientes en una pupuseria, trabaja como mesero desde hace 3 a\u00f1os, trabajo que lo aprendi\u00f3 por la misma necesidad de darle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida, para llegar a su trabajo Armando viaja en bicicleta un kilometro, trabajando en el horario de 6:00 am a 4:30 pm todos los d\u00edas.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito que esta solicitando en CREDICAMPO, es para pagar unos gastos m\u00e9dicos ya que sus hijos se encontraban muy mal de salud y no tenia los recursos econ\u00f3micos suficientes para cubrir esos gastos.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Armando es tener un negocio propio de su pupuseria, ya que en el trabajo actual ya tiene mucha experiencia, darles estudios a sus hijos para que sean profesionales y tengan mejores posibilidades de un buen trabajo y mejorar su vivienda, ya que la que tiene esta en mal estadio y es de adobe.\n","en":"Armando is 37 years old, employed, and his level of study was up to high school. He did not continue school because he decided to work in order to be able to help with the household expenses. He has a partner, and is the father of three children, ages 11, 9, and 2, two of which are in school. His life partner does household chores for a living and looks after his children while Armando makes a living tending to customers in a 'pupuseria' (a business that sells pupusas, a thick corn tortilla stuffed with cheese, fried pork rind, chicken, or refried beans). He has been working as a waiter for three years, a job that he learned for the same need to give his family a better quality of life. In order to get to his job, Armando travels a kilometer by bike, working from 6:00 am to 4:30 pm every day. \r\n\r\nThe CREDICAMPO loan that he is requesting is to pay some of the medical expenses since his children became very ill and he didn't have sufficient financial resources to cover the expenses. \r\n\r\nArmando dreams of having his own pupuseria business since in his current job he already has a lot of experience. He also dreams of giving his children an education in order for them to be professionals and have better chance of a good job, and improving his home, as it is in poor condition and is made from clay."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1711057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to pay for his children's medical expenses.

21 a\u00f1os de edad. Hace cuatro a\u00f1os, ella empez\u00f3 con la ayuda de sus padre, ahora est\u00e1 agradece no solo a ellos, tambi\u00e9n  a todas las personas que la ayudaron con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior, ya que con ese pudo comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda de su pulper\u00eda para crecer. Con ese \u00faltimo pr\u00e9stamo, las ventas crecieron, ya que pudo vender cosm\u00e9ticos y granos b\u00e1sicos al mismo tiempo.\nAhora Lauren quiere seguir invirtiendo en el negocio, por lo que solicita un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para comprar ajo, aceite, arroz, perfumes, shampoo, detergente, canela, entre otros productos que vende. Esto le permitir\u00e1 aumentar la mercader\u00eda del negocio, poder complacer con las necesidades de sus clientes y tener mayores ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Por el momento no se siente una persona autosuficiente porque quiere seguir invirtiendo en el crecimiento de su pulper\u00eda, pero sabe que siguiendo trabajando fuerte lo puede lograr.\n","en":"Work hard every day is Lauren's motto. She is an enterprising 21 year old. Four years ago, she started with her parents' help. Now she thanks not only them, but also the people who helped her with the previous loan. With it she was able to buy more merchandise for her store to grow. With that last loan, her sales increased because she was able to sell cosmetics and basic grains at the same time. \r\n\r\nNow Lauren wants to keep investing in the business. That is why she is asking for a new loan to buy garlic, oil, rice, perfumes, shampoo, detergent, cinnamon and more products that she sells. This will allow her to increase the merchandise in her business, meet the needs of her customers and have more income. Right now she doesn't feel self sufficient because she wants to keep investing in the growth of her store, but she knows that by continuing to work hard she can achieve it.

For the past 4 years, Joy has been working hard to manage her produce, selling posho (corn meal), cassava flour and beans. \n\nTo help expand her business, Joy has requested a loan of 700  SSP from WOYE MFI. The loan will be used to purchase more sacks of posho, cassava flour and beans, and will help Joy to generate greater profits and improve family's standard of living. Joy hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \n\nJoy is a member of WOYE's Micro Enterprise Lending Program (MEL).

In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 1000 Philippines peso (PHP) a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store she is requesting a 18000 PHP loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings is her source to meet their daily living expense. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nRose hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a comfortable life in their old age. She prays to always have a happy and quiet life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance

For many years, Halicha has traded in fruits, vegetables, salads, and pastries from her own shop. She started back in 1990. Through hard work, Halicha now earns 40,000 KGS per month. In addition to the shop, Halicha owns a container and refrigerators to store pickles, jams, and kumis. She rents cars and a truck to deliver both manufactured products and raw materials for production. In order to further develop her business, Halicha asked the bank Bai -Tushum for a loan of 95,000 KGS to buy a truck. According to her calculations, to buying your own vehicle is more profitable than renting. Halicha plans to invest profits from the loan into opening a new shop so that she can pay for her daughter's higher education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1715974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy a truck to distribute her goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor village, Naryn region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-23T14:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-22T14:50:13Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halicha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":552.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":552.63},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":644.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":550.19,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":30344.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.44,"payment_id":610751506},{"amount":1197.37,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":65746.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513763}],"funded_date":"2014-10-23T21:04:41Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":781975,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elena estudia la carrera de Ciencias de la Educaci\u00f3n,  vive con sus padres que son empleados, al culminar su carrera  se ve ejerciendo su profesi\u00f3n.

She plans on using her part of the loan to purchase three sacks of cabbages, three baskets of tomatoes and four sacks of aubergines. She gets her supplies from the town of M\u00e9dine. She sells her wares in exchange for cash and credit, both as a street vendor and sometimes delivering door-to-door, to a customer base comprised primarily of women. With this loan, Youma plans on making an average monthly profit of 125,000 FCFA, which will be used to pay for her children's school fees as well as for ensuring their good health.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":1712824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase foodstuffs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-10-23T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-22T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":61.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Youma                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saran                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T15:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":167515.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561793637},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167515.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758507},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":167515.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319106},{"amount":319.74,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T13:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":167515.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.26,"payment_id":610752861},{"amount":294.88,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":167515.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.12,"payment_id":624542619},{"amount":298.72,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":167515.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.28,"payment_id":636515642}],"funded_date":"2014-10-25T06:30:53Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:02:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christopher Smith","image":null}},{"id":785386,"name":"Fenie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fenie has completed signing up for her membership with PMPC and borrowed the needed capital to start up a sari-sari (variety) store business.

Milawati thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1716810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide mobile phone services in her community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Utara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-10-23T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-22T18:40:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milawati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":292.44,"local_amount":3500000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3623640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.56,"payment_id":752247670}],"funded_date":"2014-10-23T23:07:18Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T18:06:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":785501,"name":"Lufilufi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lufilufi is a 53-year-old woman who is married with five children.

supplies such as pens, bond paper and cartolina for her school and office supplies store. Through her earnings, Teresa is able to support her family and meet their daily basic needs.\r\n\r\nBecause of her entrepreneurial skill, Teresa now has an Internet shop. She is requesting a loan of PHP 50,000, which she will use to buy another PC unit to serve her growing clients. In provinces like Dasmarinas, not a lot of people own home computers. People go to an Internet shop for their business and school requirements. Teresa rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 a day from her Internet shop.  She is positive that she will have good returns on her investment. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nTeresa aims to have more branches for her Internet shop. She dreams for all her children to finish college. She prays that her family will always lead a victorious life. Teresa also desires to help her less fortunate relatives. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.

Rice is a main staple in the Philippines. It constitutes a dominant portion of the standard diet of Filipinos. Her earnings from selling rice help cover her family\u2019s daily needs. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial assistance that will be given to her. \r\n\r\nLina dreams to have another outlet for her rice store. She wants to send her children to the best schools until college. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is known for being hard-working and responsible, with a great desire for personal achievement. \n\nManowara's husband handles his own business of selling mustard oil. Manowara also assists her husband in this business. It is an essential oil resulting from grinding the mustard seeds and is widely used in cooking in India. He makes his purchases in cash from the wholesale markets and distributors in his area in bulk quantity, then after re-packing, sells to the local retail shops. His sales are in cash. He has regular and occasional customers. He began his business many years ago with his own funds and with the goal of helping with the expenses of his household. Today, it is the only source of income for his household.\n\nOne of his dreams is to be able to make an increase in the inventory in his business. The current income from the business is insufficient to cover all the expenses. So Manowara is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BJS. The purpose of this financing is to invest in working capital by buying more quantity of oil for her husband's business. She hopes the loan will help the business to be a profitable one, will earn more income for the well-being of the family, and will strengthen their economic condition.\n\n\nShe is thankful to BJS and Kiva.\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1716051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more mustard oil for retailing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-23T20:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-22T20:50:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manowara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":44,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-24T06:18:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":784754,"name":"Gulshan Abid Ali's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulshan is a 41-year-old married woman, living with her daughter in Lahore, Pakistan.

Through the income from farming he has been able to take care of his family and also provide the basic needs for his children. Robert is a very enterprising man, and although he never got formal employment, he has always worked hard on his farm and he has always assured his family of a decent meal. The Litein area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why he is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, he is sure that he will reap maximum profits and be able to increase his business. Being a man from a marginalized community and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Robert feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising men like him. Robert is much disciplined with finances and he plans that through the accumulated profits he will be able to improve his living conditions and also secure the future of his children.\nRobert says that his age doesn't stop him from doing what he is passionate about. That is why he always sets new goals for himself and among them is becoming a great horticulture farmer and to generate employment opportunities. This way he will be able to improve his quality of life and the well-being of his family and those people who help him do his daily work.

Both of them are illiterate but know to sign their name. Her husband is a farmer by trade. They have one son, who is in grade 12. Her husband usually sells the vegetables which are grown in his own land in the local village market but they have a scanty income, and that\u2019s why they are leading a very hard life. The reason for choosing this business is only due to having their own land and a sound experience in the agricultural field. Now she and her husband plan to grow broad beans in their land. \r\n\r\nThus Tulobala applied for a loan to BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner). With the loan Tulobala wishes to buy bean seeds for cultivating broad beans in their own land to generate more income. \r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will be able to grow her business. As she is living in a kaccha house (made of mud and straw) in Dhupguri, she wants to build a concrete house with the profit she will earn from her business. She also dreams her son will lead a very successful life with a good education. Tulobala is a woman with great enthusiasm and never wants to stop fighting for her family.

in the community school.  He's in a relationship and they're expecting their first child.  They live in their own home.\r\n\r\nJuan has worked in agriculture from a very young age, specifically growing corn and beans, which he learned from his parents.  When he and his life partner got involved a year ago, they decided to start a small store in the community.  While he works in the field, she's responsible for the store at home.  Juan's schedule is from 6 in the morning until 12 noon, and the store's open to the public from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe loan he's requesting is for buying agricultural inputs such as formula and sulfate for his corn crop.  He'll use another part to buy beans, sugar, coffee, and other basic products for the store.\r\n\r\nJuan's plans for the future are to improve his store so he earns more income and to improve his home to give his wife and his first child the best possible living

members of the group. She is the featured borrower of the group. Most of the group members are engaged in weaving, embroidery, and piggery businesses to earn their own income. \r\n\r\nTombi has been weaving for six years now, and her skills are extraordinary. She could not continue further studies due to their family\u2019s financial problems, and she decided to start weaving to earn income since then. \u201cI started weaving for the hope to be self-reliant and not become the burden of my family,\u201d she said. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her widowed mother, four brothers, and two sisters. Since her father left them, they have been bearing the financial problems within the household. They were helpless, since they were all very young, and their mother, whose occupation was a cultivator, had been the mere provider for the family. \r\n\r\nTombi weaves different designs of traditional shawls and wraparounds for selling purposes. With the small profit she made, she joined a local banking group referred to as a 'marup', which is formed among friends and known persons as a group.

Having understood the market needs, she wants to increase her dairy farm in a modern manner with more animals so that she can diversify the farm\u2019s products.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to her kind lenders, those who extend their hands of assistance towards her to pull her from her past situation.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1716648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow for her milk and milk products business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-24T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-23T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-24T08:33:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":784982,"name":"Azizmoh","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"    \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0435-\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u0439 57 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430. \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0445 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e, \u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \n  \u041d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0445\u0443 \u0441\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u041d\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432.\n","en":"Azizmoh lives in the city of Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.
