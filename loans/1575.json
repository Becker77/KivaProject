She is married and has three children. Her children are 3, 9 and 13 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nFor 15 years now, she has operated a sari-sari (variety) store business in Concepcion, Iloilo. She runs her store while her husband fishes for income. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy fishing nets and merchandise such as cooking oil, spices, toothpaste, milk, coffee and toiletries. She believes that the loan proceeds will help to boost her income because she always runs out of items to sell. With the additional capital, she can buy her stocks in bulk and increase her profits.

All of them live in Jenawi, a small village in Karanganyar, Indonesia.\n\nSam has been running cow-fattening farming for more than a year. He also operates a small-scale vegetable farming. Recently, he saw the cow dungs have started to pollute the water channel near his home. He was worried that it may affect his and his family\u2019s health. \n\nAfter socialized by Yayasan Rumah Energi and LKM (a local NGO \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) about Household Biogas (BIRU) program, Sam saw biogas as solution for water pollution and reducing his dependence on non- renewable cooking gas. Since Sam does not have sufficient capital to purchase a bio-digester, a loan from Kiva will help him and other farmer group members to make it possible.\n\nHe hopes that if he can build bio-digester, he can use the bio-gas for cooking, and bio-slurry (biogas residue) as fertilizers for his plantation.

However, the water from natural sources in Souvanseang's village is dirty and unsuitable for drinking without treatment. The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. Souvanseang is excited that he, like his group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water-borne diseases. Even though some people in the village, including Souvanseang, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water.

The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. Somphet is excited that he, like his group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water-borne diseases. Even though some people in the village, including Somphet, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. Somphet and other filter users also decrease the amount of money spent to boil water by purchasing less charcoal or wood and decreasing the time spent foraging for firewood. Somphet's filter is guaranteed for two years, though most users find the filter works from three to five years.

They average 41 years of age with four children each and all live in Badialan III, a district of Bamako. They got to know each other through the \"tontine\" system (a revolving finance system whereby each member contributes periodically an agreed amount and this is passed on in rotation to other group members) and through their income-generating activities. The group members have small trading businesses, such as selling condiments, fruit and vegetables (tomatoes, onions, cabbage, gombo and others). They decided to join Soro Yiriwaso in order to expand their businesses and are on their third group loan. \r\n\r\nMalado (who is standing fourth from the right on the photo) has a good reputation for selling plastic utensils of various kinds in Badialan III.

Rajabkhon and her family have been living there for a long time.  Rajabkhon is married, but her husband is currently working in Russia.  Her children are still in school.\r\n\r\nRajabkhon has been sewing women's dresses for close to 12 years.  She loves her work and is always eager to perfect her skills.  For the longest time, she's been using the sewing machine that you can see in the photo.  It is an old machine which hardly works.  Rajabkhon hopes that she will receive a loan to buy a new, modern, sewing machine.  However, new sewing machines cost a lot of money and Rajabkhon relies entirely on this loan to continue her work and keep her source of

Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns three cows, three horses and 20 sheep.  Her activity brings her close to 20,000 som (KGS) per month, which just covers the cost of food and her family's every-day expenses.  In order to further develop her business, Bagdagul has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy barley and oil-cake as feed for her livestock.

She has a secondary education.  She is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business in 1999 with an initial capital of 20,000 som (KGS).  Munargul has worked extremely hard and she currently owns four cows and 12 sheep.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lenchonghoi group consist of fifteen women striving for their own economic betterment. The name of the group \u201cLenchonghoi\u201d is a word that comes from the \u201cThadou\u201d tribe folk-tale. She was a woman who was believed to be the most beautiful woman in the world, protected and saved by her seven younger brothers from the villain known as \u201cKhalvompu.\u201d  \r\n\r\nAll members are hard-working women who came together as a group to help each other through loans. Nemboichong is the featured member of the group, pictured with her hand raised. She is 26 years old with two sons and a daughter. She has two school-going children and an infant of two years. They live in a remote place which is far away from town. In order to get there, one needs to take a passenger bus and walk few kilometres from the bus stop. Her husband is a daily wage earner whose occupation is being a mason. He has been the main source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nNemboichong weaves traditional shawls and wraparounds to generate more income and supplement their household needs. She weaves and at the same time looks after her infant child while her husband is away for work. She sometimes seeks help from neighbours and friends when she is very busy. She does the household chores when all family members are home and continues to weave after she has completed doing her household chores.  \r\n\r\nBoth parents work hard to provide for the family's well-being. They face financial problems when there is common illness like cough, rash, flu, or diarrhoea in the family. When the family members are sick, they need to pay for their medical treatment fees and medicine costs which has been very difficult in their household maintenance and they are short of funds. After paying for all these, her savings are gone and she no longer has money to buy yarn for her weaving. That affects the circulation of finances in the family when she cannot weave to generate income.\r\n\r\nFortunately, she came across WSDS where she can access loans for her business endeavour for which she is very thankful. She will buy yarn of different colours and textures to weave beautiful wraparounds and shawls to attract customers and generate more profit. She wants to start saving again by producing more products and she wishes good health for her family like every mother. She says \u201cGood health is the most valuable thing one can have because with good health all things are possible.\u201d She also thanks all the lenders for their generosity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1716620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy different colours and textures of yarn for weaving traditional shawls and wraparounds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-10-24T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-23T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vunneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linroukim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chongneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengthem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hekim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemboichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":195000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":195000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T21:25:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":782415,"name":"Rosa Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa de 57 a\u00f1os de edad posee un negocio de fotocopiadora ubicada cerca de su casa en una zona escolar desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, tiene muchos clientes, con su trabajo logra salir adelante con los gastos de la casa, vive con su hija en casa propia, la hija trabaja y le ayuda econ\u00f3micamente, ella est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de insumos como papel bond, tintas para impresoras, etc. y asi seguir con su trabajo que le genera buenas ganancias.","en":"Rosa is 57 years old.

Two of them are students; one is in grade 12, and one is in the second year in college. Her husband, Mantu, is a day laborer. She lives with her family in a small village, Khagrabari, in the district of Jalpaiguri, West Bengal. Anima's eldest son also works on a daily wage basis. Both her husband and son have inconsistent income that is barely enough for a family of five members in which two are students. \r\n\r\nTo make the family financially strong, Anima rears cattle. She keeps a dairy cow to provide milk to sell in her locality for additional income. She sells the milk in her village with the help of her husband. Every morning, she takes the cow to graze in the fields and returns by noon. Then she cooks for her family. She resumes taking care of her cow by feeding it at home. In this way, she is earning to control her cash flow, which is not sufficient to manage her daily activities. She wants to purchase one more cow.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BJS, which provides financial help to rural needy women to start new businesses. With the loan, the cow acquired will provide Anima with an additional quantity of milk. The extra milk produced will be sold to neighbors and at the local market for profit. Income generated from her business will enable Anima to pay the educational costs of her children and keep improving the quality of life that she is leading presently. \r\n\r\nShe is thankful to both BJS and Kiva for this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1717407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy a cow for her dairy business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-24T15:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-23T15:20:11Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-24T18:21:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":785826,"name":"Sharifamo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharifamo is 48 years old and lives in her own house with her family.

She is a resident of Khagrabari, a remote village in Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal. The people of this region are socially, economically, and educationally more backward in comparison to others. Bibha is 48 years old. She is a married woman with three sons. Two of them are in college, and the other is a green grocer. Her husband, 54-year-old Ramnath, is a vegetable cultivator. \r\n\r\nThe primary work of the family is farming, from which they get a low return, which makes it very difficult to maintain the family.

On average, they are 35 years old and have three children. They all live in Lafiabougou, one of the neighborhoods of Bamako. They know one another through neighborhood tontines (investment funds for raising capital) and their for-profit businesses. The members of the group run businesses, such as the sale of the high-quality shoes. With the goal of increasing their business funds, the members of the group decided to join Soro Yiriwaso and are on their third group loan. Ms. Ni\u00e8ba  (the woman seated to the far left of the photo) is well known in the sale of shoes in Lafiabougou. She expects to use this loan to buy 18 pairs of shoes. She stocks up in Bamako. The resale takes place in Lafiabougou  for cash to a clientele made up mostly of women. With this loan, Ms. Ni\u00e8ba expects to make an average monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA, which will be used in part to meet the small needs of her children with the rest to be reinvested in her business.

She is from Maynaguri.  She is married, a housewife, and is blessed with one son. She and her husband are providing education to their son who studies in grade 11. Haimanti and her husband both are uneducated because of their parents' poverty.\r\n\r\nHaimanti's husband Santosh, aged 60 years, is a cycle-rickshaw puller (a kind of three-wheeled transport widely used in rural West Bengal) by trade.   His lack of education denied him a decent job.  For many years, he has been transporting people to different places inside as well as outside of his village.  With the income that he earns, he helps his family with household expenses. It is going well for him because he is dedicated to his job, responsible, and transports his clients safely.

The father of three has been running a two acre mixed-farm for six years. His main income sources are milk, eggs, tea, and a job salary. \r\n\r\nThere is no period Josphat enjoys more than harvesting. However, this season comes with a set of challenges such as transportation of goods to and from the market. As a result, most farmers end up reducing their profits margins or even incurring losses while trying to reduce transport-related costs by selling to brokers. Those who sell in the locality are not advantaged either. \r\n\r\nJosphat is seeking a loan to purchase a carrier motorcycle that is very common in the rural areas. This is the only way he can rid himself of greedy brokers. The motorcycle will provide him with the freedom to transport his produce to further markets with fairer prices at an affordable and sustainable cost. \r\n\r\nThe money he will save from this investment will increase his profit margin. He will use the additional income to meet his family's basic needs and pay for his children's education.

Barpygul has a higher pedagogical education and had worked as a Kyrgyz language and literature teacher for many years and is now on a well-deserved retirement. Barpygul has been involved in agriculture for a long time and currently has 1 dairy cow, 2 calves and 10 sheep. She also grows clover and beans for household consumption and sale on a 2.58 hectare land plot. Despite the fact that Barpygul is involved in various businesses and takes on any type of work, her monthly earnings are not enough for a decent life. This is why, in order to further develop her business, Barpygul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 1 dairy cow and 2 bulls for fattening up and also to buy livestock feed. The earnings from the loan will allow Barpygul to improve her financial condition and expand the area of irrigated land.

Jalpaiguri, West Bengal, India. Her husband, 55-year-old Abdul, is engaged in cultivation of paddy in their village. The couple has four children (two sons and two daughters). Three of them are in school, and their eldest son helps his father in agriculture. Both Echana and her husband have a primary education. They live in their own straw, bamboo and mud-made house.\r\n\r\nEchana is a homemaker who takes care of the entire household. In order to help with all the family expenses, her husband and son have been involved in doing vegetable cultivation, such as potatoes and other green vegetables. Of late, they have started paddy cultivation and selling it to the distributors. They supply their rice to the rice dealers in the nearby market. Being an all-season crop, paddy is in great demand in the market. They think it to be a prospective crop, so they want to cultivate paddy on a large scale.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen their business and respond to client demand, Echana is requesting a loan for her husband from BJS (Kiva's field partner) to purchase fertilizers, pesticides and seeds, and to cover their operational costs. Their goal is to increase their business activity, which they think will be possible through this loan.\r\n\r\nEchana dreams to purchase a piece of land with the profit, and she expresses her gratitude to her

Mavlyudahan has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1986. \r\n\r\nThanks to persistent work, Mavlyudahan's farm currently has two cows, two calves and 10 sheep. She also has 0.76 hectares of own land, on which she and her family grow rice for internal use and for sale. Every year, Mavlyudahan sells 3-4 tons of rice. Her monthly income is around 18,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Mavlyudahan turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 90,000 som (KGS) to purchase hay for the livestock. This will allow her to keep the cattle and have healthy offspring in the spring.

","en":"Sadbarg was born in 1985.  She is the caring mother of two children, Mustafo and Mustakim, whom she raises by herself because she is divorced.  For more than a year now, she has been buying and selling food products.  She has her own store at home and many of her customers happen to be her neighbors.  Sadbarg also prepares pies and hot-dogs, which she resells to the local residents.  Since she sells high quality food products, she has some regular customers.  She has decided to increase her inventory, and with this goal in mind, she has requested a loan of 2,000 somoni for the purchase of food products.  She is awaiting your kindness and relying on your generosity.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1717309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry since 1999.  Thanks to her very hard work and patient nature, she has grown her business and she currently owns three cows and one horse.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy cows priced at about 15,000 som (KGS) each.

","en":"Saodatjon is 44 years old. She is married. Her husband's name is Umarjon and he works as a mechanic. Saodatjon and her husband have raised two children. Their daughter married a man named Makhfouz. Saodatjon works for a private firm. She is a very successful employee, but her wages are not enough to pay for her son to study at the university.

and lives with his wife and his 10 kids in the town of Les Anglais in southern Haiti. Their white and blue wooden house has no reliable access to electricity and thus, Apredieu is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. With 10 of his kids still in school, he wishes they had better light for studying at night. A solar-powered microgrid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Apredieu and his family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower-cost energy source. He is looking forward to being connected as it will allow him to save money.

Their wooden house has no reliable access to electricity and thus Sonia is forced to use costly and harmful kerosene for lighting. With six of her kids still at school, she wishes they had better light for studying at night. A solar-powered microgrid is being installed in Les Anglais, giving Sonia and her family the opportunity to connect to a higher quality, lower-cost energy source. She is looking forward to being connected as it will allow her to save money. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to cover the upfront cost of connection to the grid, which she will repay through her payments for electricity.\r\n\r\nAn electrical connection dramatically reduces the cost of lighting in towns such as Les Anglais while offering far superior light quality and more generally providing opportunities for people to dramatically improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click here<\/a>."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1717906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to connect to Haiti's first solar hybrid smart electricity grid.

Her partner is a controller at an interprovincial transportation cooperative. \r\n\r\nMartha is a woman who likes to earn what she has so she can get ahead.  She works in retail selling all kinds of clothing, sheets, awnings, and curtains.  She sells door to door; she works for two or three hours a day, mainly in the morning; she gives her customers credit and charges them every eight days.

His children aren't young any more and his sons have moved away to look for work.  Todjiboi lives in a rural area not far from the city and has been in the cattle business his entire life.  He once helped his parents look after their cattle and now he is in the very same line of work to provide for his own large family.  He earns some extra money by selling fruit that he grows in his small orchard.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve his financial situation and his children's standard of living, Todjiboi wants to increase the size of his herd and to buy feed, but he doesn't have the financial means to do so.  Todjiboi wants to take out a loan to turn his plans into reality.  He has applied to MDO Arvand, LLC in the hopes that he will find help and thanks you for it in

Her entire family gladly helps her with her business.  Nasiba has a secondary-level education and a long work history.   About 12 years ago, she started a business in farming and animal husbandry with an initial capital of 20,000 som (KGS).  As a result of her hard work, today Nasiba has two milking cows and a bull-calf.  She also rents 4.0 ha of land where she grows sainfoin and barley for cattle fodder.  Her monthly income from selling cattle and milk comes to about 18,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to developing her business further, Nasiba applied to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy pure bred milking cows to increase the volume of ecologically friendly, good tasting and farm-fresh milk that she sells.  Nasiba has plans to expand her business and to save up money to repair her

They always sell out all their milk.\r\n\r\nPresently Sultonboi wants to put away feed for the cattle, but he doesn't have enough money.  For this reason, he turned  to MDO Arvand, LLC for financial support.  Sultonboi wants to thank MDO Arvand, LLC in advance for its support and trust."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1714910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

children. He was born in a rural area and worked in the fields since childhood. He eventually moved to the city, where he currently sells watermelon and cantaloupe. Abduhalil has a place at the market and has been selling goods there for six years. Because it is seasonal work and he can only sell goods in the summer and the beginning of September, Abduhalil also works as an assistant at a flour mill. He currently wants to buy a new batch of goods but does not have the money. This is why he turned to MDO Arvand for financial support.

For the past 9 years she has raised livestock and farmed, and today she owns four milk cows, four heifers, and three steers, and also grows clover. Selling milk and animals provides the sole source of income for her family, and it is not enough to support the family at an acceptable level. She needs to expand her business farther. Because of the nearing winter season Svetlana wants to buy hay for the livestock, so she contacted Bai-Tushum for a 50,000 som (KGS) loan. This will allow Svetlana to keep and grow her livestock herd. In the future, she dreams of renovating her home.
