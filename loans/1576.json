She is married to Gimson and has two children who are still in the preparatory level at school. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs.\r\n\r\nMary Ann operates a general store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dried and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all the products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a  5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 500 PHP a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, beverages, mineral water and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her store earnings help meet the family's daily expense and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes to maintain and grow her business and open another general store. She wants to give her children the best education and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1717994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She purchases clothing from the market at a low price, sews it and sells it for a higher price. The ladies of town like her garment selection a lot. The demand for clothes has increased because the winter weather has started and people are demanding warmer clothes. She has requested a loan so she can buy more varieties of garments to fulfill the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nHajira's husband meets all the household expenses from his earnings, and she contributes her earnings only for savings.

She is single and has four children aged 40, 35, 32, and 25. She has a business selling dinners.\r\n\r\nShe is independent, feisty, persevering, understanding, responsible and hard-working. She works at the Plan 3000 neighbourhood, a place that has become a successful production centre where micro-entrepreneurs from every sector\u2014such as sewing, design, and handicraft making\u2014imitate foreign products that are sold in the main local markets. The inhabitants of the densely populated area are mainly migrants from other country's departments and foreigners.\r\n\r\nNilfa is short and has a dark complexion and long black hair. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and speaks Spanish when doing business. (In the picture, she is on the left side and is wearing a green T-shirt and shorts.) She lives alone because her children are grown-ups and independent.  \r\n\r\nOwing to the need to expand her business, she formed a communal bank to request a loan and make the members' businesses prosper. She makes a living cooking and selling \"patasca\" dinners in an open space. \"Patasca\" is a broth made out of maize and pig's head, which is the result of the cultural exchange with the Andean region. The word \"patasca\" comes from the Quechua \"phataska\", which refers to the kernels of corn that open up when cooked. Because of the particular way of preparing it, by using the whole animal's head, it has the alleged quality of curing hangovers so as to be able to continue partying.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan that she is requesting, and her 10 years of experience in this business attest to her hard work and reliability.

She is married to Robinson, a company driver. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAmor operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.\r\n\r\nAmor hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a good health and life.

This encourages him to request a loan to build his inventory.  He will buy materials such as soles, glue and tacks, among other things, to satisfy the demand that will increase at year end.

Birongo village is at the centre of a primary banana and tea growing region. However, most farmers, like Lucy, prefer to keep income-generating animals on their farmland too. Lucy started farming nine years ago. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and tea. She uses the income from these activities to take care of her family.\r\n \r\nLucy is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. With more poultry on her farm, she will produce more eggs for food, hatching and selling. She will also expand her asset base to secure more loans in the future if need be.

She is elegant, and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her three angel-like looking children as a primary caregiver. \r\n\r\nFor the past six years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, poultry, tomatoes and also keeping dairy cows. Esther has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. After her husband lost his formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family fell to Esther. It has been overwhelming because she now has to shoulder the responsibility of feeding the whole family. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said.  \r\n\r\nEsther is most passionate about horticulture farming. She takes pride in being a part of the fastest growing agriculture industry category in Kenya. However, she is facing serious challenges brought about by harsh weather conditions. \r\n\r\nEsther is seeking a loan to invest in the expansion of her horticulture farm. She sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change. With your loan, Esther will make enough income to take care of her family and other farming expenses. She wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day to give her family a decent living and afford her children proper education. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets. Esther believes that if female farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of the world's hungry could be reduced by half."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":413.91,"image":{"id":1718210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is 53 years old, and lives with her family in the Eldoret area of Kenya. She is blessed with four children who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide them a better future. Mary was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 6 years. \r\n\r\nMary always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much she likes farming she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cKoroit\u201d which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cow. Through her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nMary also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy animal feeds and farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality animal feeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production and dairy farming. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality feeds and seeds will assure her of high milk production and a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nMary is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Mary believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her child a solid educational background. This loan will be Mary\u2019s way out of poverty."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1718247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy animal feeds and farm implements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-26T15:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-25T15:30:09Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.79,"local_amount":3181.7,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3191.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680956},{"amount":30.88,"local_amount":2744.65,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2752.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625327},{"amount":34.92,"local_amount":3103.78,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3112.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194490},{"amount":33.46,"local_amount":2974.22,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2982.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823797},{"amount":36.72,"local_amount":3263.65,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3273.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262310},{"amount":36.87,"local_amount":3277.21,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3286.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264411},{"amount":37.01,"local_amount":3289.38,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3299.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600619},{"amount":39.43,"local_amount":3504.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3514.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459097},{"amount":83.82,"local_amount":7719.6,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7742.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.03,"payment_id":681377470},{"amount":72.66,"local_amount":6941.31,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6961.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.41,"payment_id":711505477}],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T20:11:14Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":786399,"name":"Eden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eden is 39 years old, married, and has three children who are in school.

He is a progressive, hardworking, middle-aged Kenyan farmer from Ntima village. He lives together with his wife of 10 years and 3 children, youngest 5 and oldest 13. Nahashon counts himself lucky to have had a supported childhood. Born third in a family with 5  siblings, Nahashon managed to clear his primary education. He studied to years of high school education before having to drop out and help his family.\r\n \r\nHe started farming in 1997 on a 1.5 acre piece of run-down land with the help of his loving father. If you visit the farm today, you will find banana, vegetables, 6 goats, 15 hens and 25 trees. Not only is Nahashon concerned about the productivity of the land today, he is also worried about the changes in climate caused by human activities. He makes it up by planting more trees always. \r\n\r\nNahashon is seeking a loan to purchase irrigation equipment for his farm. He is planning to expand banana farming but he can not count on steady rainfall. However, with an irrigation kit in place, he will be able to consistently supply water to his plants on regular basis. This will ensure the bananas grow green and healthy. This investment also reduces the risk of crop failure. \r\n\r\nNahashon will use the income generated from this investment to pay for the school boarding fees of his 2 children. By always monitoring expenses and keeping a monthly budget, Nahashon also strives to bring financial stability into his family.

She has a specialist high school education and has been working in animal husbandry since 2000. Thanks to her hard work, she currently has five cows, 20 sheep and four calves. Every day she sells milk to local residents. There is great demand for her organic and flavourful farm products, which bring in a monthly income of about 3,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nHowever, this income doesn't come close to covering her living costs. Ibadat is living with her grandson, who doesn't work because he recently returned from the army, though he gladly helps her with the farm. With the goal of further developing her business, Ibadat has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase four calves to increase her head count of livestock, which in the future will help her improve her living

She is 29 and a very cheerful and happy young woman who values kindness and a good disposition in people. She is married and has two children. She and her family live in the Rudaki region. She works as a seamstress sewing women's clothing of the national style, a trade she learned from her mother-in-law. She has been taking orders and sewing independently for more than three years, though she still depends on the advice of her mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nThe reason Shahnoza is requesting a loan is because she doesn't have enough of her own money to purchase a new sewing machine. Her current one is very old and doesn't work as well as it used to. She decided to buy a new sewing machine so it will be easier and more comfortable for her to work.

The land is fertile and close to a river from where he fetches water. On the farm he grows bananas, and he also keeps 3 dairy cattle, poultry and a pig. He has also grown 100 trees on the farm because he believes such initiatives have a real impact on climate change.\r\n\r\nLawrence is seeking a Kiva loan to purchase farm supplies for an agrovet business he is running. He will use the loan investment to restock the business. He is an astute businessman whose primary focus is on the nature of the product that he offers to the market. \r\n\r\nHe plans to repay the loan for the first few months using income from other sources as the sales of the farm supplies in the agrovet business picks up. Lawrence hopes the investment will increase his income that he will use to meet basic family expenses and education fees for his children, who are both in boarding

She is a very young married woman with two children (one boy and one girl). One attends school in grade 2, and the other is too young for school. Manuma studied up to ninth grade and after that could not continue as her family could not afford the fees.  Now she is a housewife.\r\n\r\nManuma's husband, 26-year-old Hapej, is a farmer. He has been practicing farming for many years. He is motivated to give financial sustenance to his family. So he works tirelessly for the attainment of his goal. The land he works on is fertile enough to cultivate vegetables and paddy rice. His income is generated from the sale of crops like paddy, potatoes, beans, and gourds, but now he wants to concentrate on paddy cultivation. He is pleased with the produce of his farm because it brings in good returns. What challenges him is lack of sufficient money to carry out farming activities. He wants some financial assistance.\r\n\r\nManuma wants to help her husband by taking a loan. She chose Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, to fund her because they offer good training to farmers before giving out the loans, and also, their loans have a lower interest rate. Manuma said this loan will help her to purchase agricultural materials such as seeds, manure, pest control, etc. for paddy cultivation and thus, increase her income. This will improve her family's living standards. With the profit she intends to purchase a motorbike.\r\n\r\nManuma wants to thank BJS and Kiva for their financial support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1718353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase farm supplies for paddy cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-26T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-25T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-26T20:43:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":786498,"name":"Riffat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riffat is 39 years of age.

She is really shrewd at the business, and she is optimistic that her business will improve with the financial boost.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1718374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy goats ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mbarara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-10-26T19:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-25T19:00:08Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":46.9,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579786742},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595336364},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611970174},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624410616},{"amount":73.38,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.62,"payment_id":636758941},{"amount":73.57,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-25T12:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.43,"payment_id":651654898},{"amount":66.77,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-26T12:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.23,"payment_id":668716046},{"amount":66.57,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.43,"payment_id":681545860},{"amount":62.34,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.66,"payment_id":696785877},{"amount":60.47,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-24T12:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200625.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.53,"payment_id":714046568}],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T23:37:13Z","paid_date":"2015-09-24T12:18:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":783109,"name":"Flor Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la pila de Montecristi se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas el Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito  Para el Futuro De la Mujer.
