It is going well for him because he is dedicated to his job and responsible; he transports his clients and goods safely. Unfortunately, of late, his van met with an accident and was severely damaged. He needs to buy a new cycle-van.\r\n\r\nSo, Shobha asked for a loan from BJS (Kiva's partner) to help her husband by purchasing a new cycle-van. He will continue working with the same determination and enthusiasm and will improve his family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband appreciate the help of their generous lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1718419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a cycle-van for her husband.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhupguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-26T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-25T20:50:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shobha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T12:14:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":786579,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is a 43-year-old married woman with two children who are 17 and 11 years old.\r\n\r\nAgnes has sold poultry  for 2 years and earns a monthly income of 4,000 KES.\r\n\r\nAgnes requests 30,000 KES to purchase poultry.

Kenya\u2019s export revenue, and employs approximately 70% of Kenyans. Despite the importance of agriculture to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain under served by financial institutions. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers. \r\n\r\nMeet Phelister. She is a mother of 4 with a deeply engraved passion in dairy farming. After all, that is what she has been doing for over 10 years. She owns a small farm in Kipkaren village which is situated in the Rift valley Province of Kenya. The income she makes from farming is not sufficient to comfortably sustain her family. As a result, Phelister has ventured into a couple of small side businesses to make extra shillings. With the aid of her husband, Phelister also rears poultry and grows maize, amongst other crops. \r\n\r\nPhelister is seeking a loan of KES 65,000 for constructing a cowshed. She plans to put up a well-designed barn that will provide a clean, comfortable home for her herd and a pleasant, efficient workplace for her. In a bid to increase milk production, the cowshed will provide a favorable environment for the cows. With your loan, Phelister has carefully planned for the storage and handling of milk, feed, bedding and manure, as these account for most of the labor in any dairy farm. The housing will have a plentiful, dependable supply of good water, made available 24 hours a day. The income she will make from this investment will put her in a position to comfortably afford increasing farming costs. Her family also stands to benefit from the growth of their agri-business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1718378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-26T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-25T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.53,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phelister","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56,"local_amount":4853.66,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4992.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680958},{"amount":56.07,"local_amount":4859.41,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4998.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625331},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":5045.81,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5190.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194494},{"amount":59.75,"local_amount":5178.54,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5326.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823803},{"amount":57.27,"local_amount":4963.55,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5105.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262314},{"amount":65.08,"local_amount":5640.61,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5802.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264415},{"amount":61.83,"local_amount":5358.68,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5512.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600623},{"amount":65.84,"local_amount":5706.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5869.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459101},{"amount":62.58,"local_amount":5619.05,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5780.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"payment_id":681377474},{"amount":67.11,"local_amount":6067.12,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6240.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.9,"payment_id":696587206},{"amount":125.72,"local_amount":11707.31,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":12042.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.37,"payment_id":711505481}],"funded_date":"2014-10-26T23:45:40Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katrina Drabeck","image":null}},{"id":786576,"name":"Fatima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima is a 37-year-old married woman with five children.

She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market.  This loan will help Grace to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Grace feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of this loan are astronomical because Grace will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering  produce to the market.  She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market.  Her income will  increase.  \r\n\r\nGrace is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work.

She is requesting a loan in order to cover her expenses.  This is her story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cMy name is Raquel and I\u2019m from San Pedro de Macor\u00eds in the Dominican Republic.  I am 20 years old and live with my parents, a sister, and two nephews.  My father works as a motorcycle taxi driver and my mother is a homemaker.  <br \/><br \/>I want to study law at \u201cUniversidad del Caribe\u201d (University of the Caribbean) in Santo Domingo.  I completed my secondary studies at the Gast\u00f3n Fernando Deligne Politechnical Institute with a specialization in business.  I had the pleasure of discovering subjects related to the law, such as traffic law, labor law, the constitution, and other topics.  Seeing how all of these subjects are interrelated was what attracted me to this degree program.  <br \/><br \/>To understand the beauty of the subject \u2013 the order, the regulations, the justice system, and the laws \u2013 the University of the Caribbean is one of the best law schools in the country.  For me, it would be a real honor to pursue this educational opportunity being offered by FUNDAPEC and Kiva.  <br \/><br \/>I come from a humble family, so my parents don\u2019t have the necessary income to afford my degree program.  I work as a medical assistant and earn a small monthly salary of $5000.  Along with the help of my parents, I am able to afford the cost of travel, food, and books.  I am requesting a Kiva loan in order to pay my tuition.  Unless I receive a scholarship or a loan, I won\u2019t be able to study.  <br \/><br \/>If I get approved for this loan, I will study hard so that I can graduate on time and secure a good job.  I would like to work for the Supreme Court in Santo Domingo.  It is shocking to see the injustice that exists in our society, so I want to work for the public welfare and demonstrate that I can be a fair, honest, and principled lawyer.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1713625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Many years ago, she established her grocery store business.  Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid six loans from Patan BPW.  She used her most recent loan to buy grocery goods for her business.  In the future, Sajana plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. <br \/><br \/>In the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores (pasal) are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.

They all live in her mother\u00b4s house and have basic services such as water and electricity. \r\n\r\nHer business sells toys for babies, boys and girls, educational toys and toys for all ages. She sells these toys from her own sales stand, which she inherited from her mother-in-law, who previously did the same work in the same place. Previously, she was a housewife. Her primary challenge is that her sales booth is outside and all of her merchandise is exposed to climate changes, such as sunlight and rain. \r\n\r\nShe has a year of experience in this business and this is the first loan she is requesting.

Little by little her business has grown, but her infrastructure has not. This is the reason she is requesting a loan, her first financing provided through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Through the loan she will buy a fridge, 8 chairs and 2 tables, as well as a bigger sized pot to serve her customer base that grows every day.

She wants to obtain financial assistance from Paglaum MPC amounting to PHP 5,000 for the purchase of new nets, foam and other fishing accessories. As much as possible, she has to have all the needed fishing accessories to minimize the chances of a low or zero catch. She also wants to buy the fish catch from her neighbors so she can sell more fish to the nearby fish market, where she will fetch higher prices. In the future, she dreams of purchasing a new fishing boat by setting aside some savings from the daily sales.

She has the equivalent of a high school education and used to work for many years in a bakery shop.  She is now a pensioner, and since 1996, she has been involved in agriculture, an activity which provides an additional income for her family.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two dairy cows, two horses and ten sheep.  She also has a plot of land measuring 4.88 hectares, on which she grows potatoes, cereals and sainfoin.  In their spare time, her son and grandchildren actively help Kusorkan to run the farm and to sell milk.  Kusorkan makes a total monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  The family also takes any odd job, since the grandchildren need to be raised and educated.  Kusorkan's income is vastly insufficient to provide a decent living and to meet all the needs of the family.  For this reason, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will primarily use her loan to purchase livestock, and also to buy some animal feed.  By developing her business, Kusorkan hopes to increase her production of milk for resale.  The earnings from her loan will enable her to expand her business and to improve her family's welfare."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":754.26,"image":{"id":1719889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

Her family has long been involved in commerce, so Oysara herself decided to start her own commercial business, in the hope of solving some financial difficulties.  She doesn't own a shop or a booth.  Instead, like many other vendors, she brings her merchandise in bags,  and displays the goods that she sells directly on the ground.  Oysara is not complaining about her working conditions, but she would love to increase her activity and her income, and improve her work environment.  She is currently taking a loan to buy a bulk quantity of almonds for resale.  Oysara is hoping that this loan will help her to achieve her goals and will enable her to improve her family's financial situation.\r\n\r\n

He has been farming for four years. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy more fertilizers for banana production. The profits from the business will be used to renovate his house.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

This is Caleb. He is the Deputy Head Teacher at St. Anthony Primary School a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Mutungo, Kampala District with 200 students. St. Anthony Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining an Ultra filtration water system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase an Ultra filtration water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Anthony Primary School will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank. Caleb ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.

Her husband is only a minimum wage earner in a private institution. Unable to cover the needs of the family with only her husband's income, she has found ways to attain income through buying and selling grocery items. She has been in this business for three years already. The business helped her meet her family's financial needs, especially the education of her children. \r\n\r\nElma is still continuing the business because it provides good income, due to her loyal customers.

receives very good offers, to respond to solicitations from her customers for parties to celebrate graduation, Christmas,  or the arrival of family members from other countries or cities, which is the common denominator that increases the demand for party snacks, such as finger foods, salads, and wheat flour pastries, plus clothes, shoes, perfume, etc., because everyone wants to dance, eat, and drink with family and their closest friends, making this Kiva loan a very successful investment.

Her business is selling frozen treats.  She is enterprising, a good mother, hard-working, responsible, unchanging and independent.  She works in the area \"Plan 3000\", a location known for constant business growth in all areas.\r\n\r\nLorena is brown-skinned, of medium height, with long dark hair.  Her first language is Spanish and she also  knows the guaran\u00ed language as a family heritage. (She is seated on the left, wearing a pink, sleeveless blouse.)  Lorena shares her life with her husband who works in construction, and with their three children.  Two children are in school and the other is still very small.  The need to increase their income and prosper in her business has led Lorena to form a group of people with different businesses to ask for a loan.  Her business is selling frozen treats of the \"bolo\" type.\r\n\r\nThe  ever-present  heat in the city where she lives makes Lorena's work a prosperous business, since frozen treats of every kind are consumed in large quantities all the time.   The \"bolo\" type is typically made with water but some are of fruit alone and others have milk added.  We find them in many flavors such as  l\u00facuma, mango, strawberry, coconut,  maracuy\u00e1, chocolate, etc. and also l\u00facuma with milk, , strawberry with milk, coconut with milk, etc. and they come packaged in a long, thin plastic wrapping.  They mostly are priced affordably.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan Lorena has asked for, and she has been in business for seven years.  She dreams of having a large and prosperous business to employ others, and wants to grow her business  by purchasing a freezer to store her \"bolos\" and having a large quantity of products to offer for sale.  These are the reasons Lorena is asking for a loan to buy a freezer and to increase her business.

To do this, he has to leverage his business and pay the debt using the returns he will get from selling the cereals. \r\nMugambi describes his childhood as difficult. It took hard work and street smarts to get him where he is today. The environment he has been exposed to has made him very cautious when approaching new business opportunities. The fact he is somewhat risk-averse makes him a favourable borrower with a sober approach on how he is going to spend and regain money. \r\nHe stated  that he will use the increased income to pay for his children's education.

Her biggest challenge over the years as a farmer has been lack of adequate capital. It is very hard for small farmers to save enough capital for expansion since farming is marred with all sorts of external risks, such as climatic conditions, pests and diseases, political instability, fluctuation of prices and high costs of inputs. Because of these factors, the sure way farmers can obtain adequate capital is through leveraging their businesses.

Saltanat has a secondary education and works as a waitress at a restaurant. Saltanat lives with her brother because her parents passed away. To provide additional income, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, growing potatoes on 1.0 hectare of owned land. Her business also contains 3 cows, a horse and 15 sheep. Saltanat sells milk on a daily basis. Thanks to her hard work, her aggregate income amounts to 8,000 som (KGS), but this money is not enough to have a decent life. Saltanat is saving her entire salary for education because she wants to go to a university. This is why, in order to further develop her business, Saltanat requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to gather her potatoes harvest and buy livestock for fattening up.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Shirley earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShirley requested a loan for 8,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nShirley meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from  God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1719027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-10-27T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-26T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.02,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T11:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561625655},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2389.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535803},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2389.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134149},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.37,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2389.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756917}],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T17:46:14Z","paid_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":787068,"name":"Omar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omar is a 21-year-old single man who opened his own barber shop three years ago to cover his needs and expenses.

She is blessed with two children, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. \r\n\r\nOn her farm, Elmelida grows maize, has a dairy cow, and keeps poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize, and when she is not farming, Elmelida engages in some personal business to help supplement the meager income she earns. However, despite the meager earnings, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nElmelida's biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. For a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Elmelida formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. With her previous loan, Elmelida purchased a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful). Mrembo produces milk daily, which Elmelida sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" says Elmelida. The money Elmelida earned from selling the milk was adequate to repay her loan. \r\n\r\nToday, Elmelida is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Elmelida is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good livelihood."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1719024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He counts himself lucky to get the support of his 34-year-old wife and two daughters, who are still in their infancy. \r\n\r\nJulius is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. The toughest problems he faces when working on his farm are the unreliability and inefficiency of the old equipment. Using such tools compromises the quality of work, and makes the user weary. With your loan, however, Julius will acquire modern tools that are comfortable to handle, more effective, and produce a better quality of work. This acquisition will save him a lot of time and effort that he spends on the farm.\r\n\r\nProceeds from the investment will help him meet his family's basic needs.

Meet Pamela, 41 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Nyakoe, a remote village in Kisii. She is happily married and is blessed with four adorable children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years, and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kisii area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 10,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1719046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-27T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-26T17:40:06Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.8,"local_amount":863.62,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":961.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625343},{"amount":21.88,"local_amount":1750.79,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1949.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194505},{"amount":19.6,"local_amount":1568.06,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1746.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262325},{"amount":21.38,"local_amount":1710.43,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1904.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600633},{"amount":21.4,"local_amount":1774.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1976.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":681377485},{"amount":21.95,"local_amount":1888.17,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2102.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.65,"payment_id":711505490},{"amount":5.31,"local_amount":444.37,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":494.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":752110589}],"funded_date":"2014-10-27T18:10:32Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":787103,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa is married and she has six children.

She will utilize the loan to pay for dried fish, biscuits, charcoal, and rice, which are necessary in her business. The more of stocks that she displayed at her stall, the better. More items to sell should result in greater profit. Filipina's profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her children.

He stays with his beautiful wife Salina and his five children. David has been running a mixed farm for at least 12 years.  His primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea.\r\n\r\nDavid heavily relies on milk production for his regular income, because tea farming follows a seasonal cycle and the poultry farm is not so big yet. The problem arises when, for one reason or the other, he cannot milk his cow. This often occurs whenever the cow is under treatment. It is for this reason that David is seeking a loan to purchase an additional cow.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, the acquired cow will cover such periods of temporary shortages. When both cows are milked, the farmer will get more milk for sale thus more income. David being a man so concerned about the future of his kids, he has already committed any income generated from this investment to his children's education fees. He believes that through education, his children will have a better living.

David describes his upbringing as challenging, so he is doing everything in his power to provide a good foundation for his children and to help secure their future. \r\n\r\nDavid has been farming for over 12 years. Over the years he has gained much experience and is now considered to be one of the best farmers in his village because of the immense knowledge he possesses. Since he has excess food for dairy cattle and enough space on his land, David has always wanted to buy another dairy cow, but his challenge is a lack of finances. That is why Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like David to turn their dreams into reality.

is a hardworking, 44-year-old mother who resides in Siquijor, Philippines.

So, Cyclin opened a meat shop where she buys one pig at a time and sells the pork cuts. Cyclin has been in the business for more than 2 years now and she wants to expand. She has decided to include beef and chicken, and she wants to improve the store space as well.

the mother of three children. Sonunbubu has secondary education. She is on a pension, but works as a medical assistant. Since 1990, she has also worked with livestock breeding, after having started this business with the purchase of a calf. Thanks to Sonunbubu's persistent work, her farm currently has eight cows and five sheep. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Sonunbubu turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows with calves to increase the number of livestock and the volume of milk for selling. Sonunbubu plans to invest the income from the loan in developing her business, which will allow her to renovate her house in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1720014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase one cow with calf in order to increase the headcount of livestock and the volume of milk for selling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Mayluu Suu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-27T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-26T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonunbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":8824},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9067},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9316},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9572},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9835},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10106},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10384},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10669},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10963},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":11264}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.83,"local_amount":8824,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8838.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489352},{"amount":163.21,"local_amount":9067,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":9081.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436549},{"amount":167.69,"local_amount":9316,"processed_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9330.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751529},{"amount":171.3,"local_amount":9572,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9587.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":624799238},{"amount":169.82,"local_amount":9835,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":9850.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.21,"payment_id":636161391},{"amount":181.91,"local_amount":10106,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10122.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513791},{"amount":186.91,"local_amount":10384,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":10400.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995544},{"amount":187.4,"local_amount":10669,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10686.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.64,"payment_id":681290951},{"amount":196.7,"local_amount":10963,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10980.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":696500180},{"amount":184.86,"local_amount":11264,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":11282.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.89,"payment_id":711411136}],"funded_date":"2014-10-31T19:17:00Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:02:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":787236,"name":"Loving","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loving is a man of about 40 years, living with his wife and two children, both of whom are going to school.
