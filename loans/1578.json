Ngahnei Kim is the featured borrower of Lenlai group, pictured with her hand raised. She is blessed with three sons and two daughters. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a peon in government office. His income, however, could not meet the family's expenses with the children's educational cost. \u201cI am very happy with five children who light up my life every day, but when I realize that I cannot provide them with higher education expenses, I feel like an underachiever as a mother,\" she sighs as she narrates her family story. \r\n\r\nHer eldest daughter had to give up higher education due to the weak finances of the family and help her mother in household chores and cultivation. Since there are no colleges in nearby villages, higher education is costly because she needs to pay either for a rented room or hostel fee and mess fee to join regular classes in town, which is very expensive. The family cannot afford to send her to college with the other four children still in school. \r\n\r\nNgahnei Kim had availed herself of loans in the previous years which have been utilized in her farming to cultivate seasonal crops. She cultivated corn, ginger, pumpkins and potatoes in the previous years and made profit by selling them in the market. She provides education costs and other household requirements from the profit. \r\n\r\nShe is engaged in the field till sunset and comes home with the vegetables she produces from the field. She prepares the vegetables in bundles to sell them early in the next morning. She earns her income from the profit she makes by selling vegetables in the market. \r\n\r\nShe holds a good record of repaying the loan amount she had taken in the previous years and aspires to take loans in the future again. The loan she is taking at present will be used for buying saplings for cultivation, and also to buy vegetables from neighbours and villagers for selling in the market to earn more. \r\n\r\nShe is very excited and thanks the lenders for their benevolent act and wishes their kindness acts to continue.

He didn\u2019t like school, which is why he didn\u2019t put very much determination into it. What he liked was working on the farm with his father. He is married, and his wife is dedicated to household tasks. They only have one child, who lives with them; he doesn\u2019t attend school yet. As of today, only the three of them live in their house.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 sells firewood (coal), which he buys, prepares, and then sells in the city. He has already done this work for 5 years. He learned this work from his father; it was also from his father that he learned that life is easier when one works honorably and is dedicated to his work. Additionally, he works in agriculture. He grows beans, corn, and sorghum. He also does business in cars; upon finding one at a low price, he buys it and then re-sells it at a better price. Otherwise, he has not had other businesses so far.\r\n\r\nHe covers 1 kilometer daily on foot. He also pays someone that helps him with his work. His work schedule is from 6:00am to noon. He received a previous loan from Kiva and succeeded in making repairs to his home, such as improving the doors of his house.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from CREDICAMPO is to buy a motorcycle that is sold at a low price, because he wants to take advantage of buying it so that he can sell it at a better price after he makes some adjustments.\r\n\r\nHis dreams for the future are to be able to improve his house and for his son to grow up in better conditions than he did.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Idris can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Idris to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Idris said: \u201c I would like to use this

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Bala can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Bala to generate earnings of up to $1,000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Bala said: \u201cI would like to use this

Muazu joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Tina, Naomi and Alhamdu. \r\n\r\nMuazu is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. As a result of his previous loan for inputs, Muazu expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize; double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Muazu would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to cater for his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Muazu can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Muazu to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. When asked, Muazu said: \u201c I would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately, I hope to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\"\r\n

Dauda joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Theoplus, Kauna and Sunday. Dauda is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. As a result of his previous loan for inputs, Dauda expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize, double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Dauda would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, in order to receive cash for immediate needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Dauda can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Dauda to generate earnings of up to 1,000 USD\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. When asked, Dauda said, \u201cI would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately, I hope to make more money for myself and my family.\"\r\n

Zubairu Sabo is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. \r\n\r\nAs a result of his previous loan for farm supplies, Zubairu Sabo expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize, which is double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Zubairu Sabo would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest to cater for his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Zubairu Sabo can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Zubairu Sabo to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

She has a convenience store in her neighborhood. Mariela is entrepreneurial, a good mother, hard-working, consistent, and responsible. Her store is located in her home near the Pirai river in the southern area of the city. This area is known for its river, a place where people gather on the weekends, rustic homes made of local materials, traditional food, and a place to play sports. Mariela has a dark complexion, long black hair, of medium height, and her first language is Spanish  and she also speaks Guarani through her family's history (she is standing on the right in the blue shirt). She shares her life with her three children, the oldest is finishing high school and the youngest are still in the care of their mother.<br \/><br \/>She needs to expand her business in order to generate more income to support her family, This need has led her to form a bank with colleagues of different businesses and needs to seek a loan. This is her second cycle in the four years that she has been working with the business. Her main work is the convenience store with basic staple food items such as bread, sugar, rice, noodles, soda pop, etc. On weekends she makes small meals for those people who are coming to the river area. For example, she makes \"majao\" which is rice with cheese, fried plantain, and fried egg; or \"masacl\" which has meat with yuca and cheese; \"el sonso\" which is a mixture of yuca and cheese, etc.  Since she takes care of her small children it is very difficult to adequately stock her store and make the purchases for the ingredients for the weekends, therefore she loses sales in both activities.<br \/><br \/>Her dream is to have a mini-market in her own home. She hopes to expand her business, buying basic staple foods at wholesale for her two businesses. For this reason Mariela seeks a loan to buy food at wholesale to expand both her businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":1714502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic stable food items at wholesale for her store and catering businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stefany Nathalya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lily Yobana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yocelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diego Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhonny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2295.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2298.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2340.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2426.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2470.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2515.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2560.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2607.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2633.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2717.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2752.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":335.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":347.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":353.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":384.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1358.67,"local_amount":9316.58,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9320.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556597},{"amount":714.04,"local_amount":4896.28,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4898.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157281},{"amount":740.27,"local_amount":5076.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5078.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554180},{"amount":764.39,"local_amount":5241.5,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5243.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226720},{"amount":797.63,"local_amount":5469.52,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5471.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213900}],"funded_date":"2014-11-01T08:03:42Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":787376,"name":"Leila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leila is a 35-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband, a vegetable trader, and her four children attending school.

She lives in the small Qubadiyon district of Tajikistan.  She is married, with children. Her children attend school, and her husband doesn't have a fixed job.  Bahor herself works as a home economics teacher in a local school.  She also provides sewing services.  She started sewing three years ago and is determined to continue in this field.  She doesn't make much money as a school teacher, and the earnings she receives thanks to her sewing business constitute her family's main source of income.  Bahor is eager to improve the quality of her work and to attract a larger group of customers.  She currently needs to buy a sewing machine suitable for over-sewing, so that she can better handle the cuttings and seams of the clothes she sews.  She will use the extra money to buy fabrics and other sewing supplies.  She hopes to receive your

Gambo joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children; Audu, Abdubasi and Abba. Gambo is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. As a result of his previous loan for inputs, Gambo expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize, double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. \r\n\r\nBefore he became a Babban Gona member, Gambo would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest to meet his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Gambo can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Gambo to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

They live in Upenpally in Jalpaiguri district.\r\n\r\nKanu's husband has a very inconsistent income, which is not adequate to meet all the expenses of a five-member family like them. Kanu always wanted to extend her helping hands to her husband to run the family well. She decided to contribute to her family by practicing cattle farming and started raising a dairy cow. She has been selling milk to her neighbors for the last few years. In this way, she tries to provide supplementary income to her family.\r\n\r\nKanu has been earning a decent income from dairy farming. However, the demand is overwhelming, and she wants to increase her dairy cattle. The biggest challenge is a lack of funds. So she is seeking a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BJS, with which she plans to purchase a quality breed of dairy cow. \r\n\r\nKanu will use profits from selling milk on her children's education and well-being. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future.\r\n\r\nShe gives her hearty thanks to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1719347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase a dairy cow for her dairy business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-28T05:16:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":787958,"name":"Gulsara","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0418\u0441\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0435\u0439 41 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c. 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0440\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431 \u0438 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430, \u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430. \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u0438 \u043e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441. \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0440\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f. \n\u0413\u0443\u043b\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443. \u0411\u0435\u0437 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c.

She is based in Chepkero, a remote village in Eldoret, Kenya. It is a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married and, together with her husband, has two lovely children. Her primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Lois is a tough woman with tough skin and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling. The Eldoret area has conditions that favor dairy farming and Lois has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow but the lack of animal feed has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy animal feed. Through the loan, she will be able to have enough animal feed to increase her milk production. With the loan, her cow will produce more milk, which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Eldoret area is high but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Lois is going to reap more and comfortably meet the demand. Her increased income will allow Lois to provide a secure future for her school-going children by paying their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success. Her vision is to keep even more dairy cows so that she will be able to build a biogas digester, which would help her to save more energy.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1718392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.01,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lois","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.9,"local_amount":1590.85,"processed_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-11-17T12:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":561680959},{"amount":15.44,"local_amount":1372.32,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1380.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625333},{"amount":17.46,"local_amount":1551.89,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1560.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194496},{"amount":16.73,"local_amount":1487.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1495.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823807},{"amount":18.36,"local_amount":1631.82,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1641.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262316},{"amount":18.43,"local_amount":1638.6,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1648.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264417},{"amount":18.5,"local_amount":1644.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1654.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600625},{"amount":19.71,"local_amount":1752.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1762.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459103},{"amount":42.02,"local_amount":3859.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3881.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.4,"payment_id":681377476},{"amount":36.44,"local_amount":3470.66,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3490.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.61,"payment_id":711505483}],"funded_date":"2014-10-28T07:29:29Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":787403,"name":"Blessing Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These members are part of the group called Blessing and it consists of 4 members.

She is married to Tapas, aged 30 years. Minati and her husband studied till grade 6 and 7, respectively. Together they are raising their two children (one son and one daughter) with love and care. The children read in a primary village school.\r\n\r\nMinati's husband is a farmer. Minati is also a very hardworking woman who pursues the domestic duties in her home and also helps her husband in his agricultural activities. Along with her partner, she grows potatoes, beans, bottle gourds, chilies, etc. They developed this business many years ago, and she learned along with him. \r\n\r\nLike other cultivators, her plans for the future are to expand her property and grow other crops in their farmland. She wants to cultivate paddy, which is a round the year crop, having much demand in West Bengal.\r\n\r\nSo, she is applying for financial help from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase agricultural supplies like seeds, fertilizers, manure, etc., to start cultivation of paddy.

Joshua joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his child: Timothy. Joshua is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. As a result of his previous loan for inputs, Joshua expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize; double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Joshua would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to cater for his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Joshua can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Joshua to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. When asked, Joshua said: \u201c I would like to use this additional income to educate my child, and ultimately, I hope to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1624666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to meet urgent expenses, child school fees, food and  farm loan repayment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T10:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T10:30:03Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":5748,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5748}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-28T11:04:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jonathan Hiebert","image":852394}},{"id":787441,"name":"Aurel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Aurel (father) and Kristina (daughter, mute and deaf since birth) in the photograph; Aurel is seeking your financial help to pay for his 20-year-old daughter\u2019s schooling fees who is going to study economics in a public university at the nearby city of Korca.

She is an eager, hardworking woman and has been running her small business for three years, selling kuraga (apricot halves). She usually buys the dried apricots, soaks them in water, removes the pit, and dries them in the sun. This is how she makes kuraga, which she then sells at the market.

The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. \r\n\r\nBualeevan is excited that he, like his group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. Even though some people in the village, including Bualeevan, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income available to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water.

Before he became a Babban Gona member, Aminu would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest to cater for his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Aminu can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Aminu to generate earnings of up to $1,000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

Also, to provide additional income for her family, she is involved in farming and animal husbandry, having started this business over 20 years ago. Thanks to Zhiydegul's drive and hard work, today her business contains 1 bull, 2 horses and 5 sheep. She also grows clover, barley and wheat on her own land of 1.2 hectares. She has already prepared barns for livestock, 300 bales of hay, 2 tons of barley and 1 ton of wheat for the winter. In order to further develop her business, Zhiydegul requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to sheep and heifers. Zhiydegul intends to increase her livestock headcount, which would lead to earning a bigger aggregate profit from reselling livestock and meat. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1620,"image":{"id":1720197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional heifers and sheep for fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ara-Kol village, Naryn region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":115.94,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhiydegul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":540},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1080},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1080}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":540,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":30048.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513795},{"amount":964.06,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":60096.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":115.94,"payment_id":730933403}],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T03:38:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":787511,"name":"Nasang Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wang is excited that he, like his group members, was able to purchase a water filter. The silver nitrate-infused ceramic element removes and destroys bacteria and similar agents of water-borne diseases. Wang's village takes water from relatively shallow wells and from local streams; however, the water from natural sources in his village is dirty and unsuitable for drinking without treatment.  Even though some people in the village, including Wang, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water.

Rebecca joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for her children, Joshua, John and Daborah. Rebecca is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution for ending the cycle of poverty.

a new loan to MUK. With 9 members and a 13,500,000 IDR loan, some members are still with the pig-raising program and other members will try a new effort as a farmer. They had success with their pig program and are able to continue to manage the business with their own money. This week the rain started to fall, and this is the right time to go to the garden and plant many crops.\r\n\r\nHaving had success with her own business selling piglets, Ni Komang is continuing to borrow and will now use her loan to purchase melon seeds and fertilizer. She has 10 acres of land, and together with her husband, she will grow melon fruit.\r\n\r\nNi Komang has calculated the cost: the melon program needs 4,000,000 IDR and she and her husband already have 2,500,000 IDR. The melon fruit needs 2.5 months from planting to harvest. Ni Komang predicts she can sell all of her melons and that she will receive 9,000,000 IDR with the melons priced at 6,000 IDR\/kg. The profit will be around 5,000,000 IDR for 2.5 months.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her plan will run smoothly and that the melon can grow well and without attack by diseases. And if she earns enough profit, she will not borrow a loan again but will give to other women in her village an opportunity to have a loan from MUK.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1719814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase melon seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayu Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kade","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":13500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":13500000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":13511293.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649609297}],"funded_date":"2014-10-28T21:43:54Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:42:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":784327,"name":"Maria Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Maria Elizabeth se sigue dedicando al negocio de venta de comida, la socia por medio de este negocio quiere salir adelante, la socia hace platos como pollo al horno, sopas entre otros, el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar su negocio de venta de comida.

They both work to continually provide income to meet their daily personal and household needs.\r\n\r\nJerriel operates a variety store while his partner drives their side car. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails fresh, dried, and packaged goods. It has almost all the essential household items and food. He earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help him grow his business, he is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan which he will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, corn rice, assorted biscuits, cooking oil, and beverages; and to pay for his sidecar which his partner will drive around their community. He is positive this will boost his income as he expands his business. He thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him. In the photo, his partner appears standing beside their sidecar while he is with their child inside the unit.\r\n\r\nJerriel aims to grow his business to give his family a better life. He wants to give his child the best education possible. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is single and lives in Ica with her family.\r\n\r\nShe is now studying at an institution in her city in a technical program. She is getting ahead thanks to the good example that her parents have offered her and to all the values with which she was instilled she was a little girl. To help her family with the educational and household expenses, she is working for a large business as a cashier. She is a very responsible daughter and always helps her family.\r\n\r\nNieves wants to transfer to another institution and thus be able to validate the classes that she has taken up to now.

Benedicta used her leadership to create the Kinawataka Women Initiatives co-operative with a mission to help marginalized women develop entrepreneurial, artisan and agricultural skills so they may create a sustainable income for themselves and their families. The co-operative also supports the needs of many orphans in the area.\n\nKinawataka Women Initiatives is seeking additional capital to fully utilize the 10 acres of land it has available for farming. This loan will help the women purchase seedlings, livestock, raw artisan materials and a small truck to help them transport goods efficiently to market so they can maximize their earning potential.\n\nBenedicta is a participant in The Coca-Cola Company's 5by20 program.

years old, married, and the mother of four children, some of whom are in school while the others are still in preschool.  She has the equivalent of a high school education and is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this business in 1999.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two cows and ten sheep, and she also grows potatoes, annually, on a 4- hectare plot of land.  The potatoes that she grows are used both for the family's own consumption and for resale.  She sells her organic crops and home-made milk to the local residents as well as to wholesale buyers.  Raushan makes more than 20,000 som per month (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy one heifer for breeding.  Raushan is planning to reinvest her earnings from her loan into further increasing her business and into her children's education and upbringing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1720639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase one heifer in order to increase her livestock headcount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Oktyabr village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raushan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":863.35,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50080.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.65,"payment_id":636161396}],"funded_date":"2014-10-29T01:30:34Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}}]}
