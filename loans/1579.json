She has the equivalent of a high school education and is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this business in 1999.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two cows and ten sheep, and she also grows potatoes, annually, on a 4- hectare plot of land.  The potatoes that she grows are used both for the family's own consumption and for resale.  She sells her organic crops and home-made milk to the local residents as well as to wholesale buyers.  Raushan makes more than 20,000 som per month (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to the Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy one heifer for breeding.  Raushan is planning to reinvest her earnings from her loan into further increasing her business and into her children's education and upbringing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1720639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase one heifer in order to increase her livestock headcount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Oktyabr village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-28T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-27T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raushan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":863.35,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50080.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":36.65,"payment_id":636161396}],"funded_date":"2014-10-29T01:30:34Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":787831,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a married woman; she has five children, all of whom attend school.

Before he became a Babban Gona member, Baballe would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to cater for his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Baballe can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Baballe to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

She works very hard to provide a good life to her children.  At the moment, her son is a first year student at the Technical Institute of the Technological University of Tajikistan.  He is studying economics and programming, and he wants to work in banking after graduation.  He finished secondary school with outstanding grades and plans to graduate from university with honors.

","en":"Elmira is 31 years old, married, and the mother of two children who are not in school yet. She has a specialized secondary education in the health sciences.  Four years ago she started working in agriculture and animal husbandry to provide a source of income to her family.  Thanks to her constant labor and very hard work, she has done well and she now makes a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).  She currently owns one dairy cow, one young bull, 10 sheep and two horses, as well as 1.36 hectare of land on which she grows potatoes and sainfoin for the family's consumption and for resale.  Since she lives at home with her children and parents, she has decided to install a heating system inside her house.  For this reason, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy a heating boiler, radiators, pipes and other items.  With a heated house, Elmira will be able to take better care of her family's health during the winter months.  She plans to re-invest the earnings from her business into further expanding her activity.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1720664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

is married and has a daughter.

She was able to contribute to the household financially and meet her child\u2019s needs, she explains.  She says it is very nice for a person to earn his or her own money, even if it\u2019s only a little. She wants to continue working with Tupperware and become a group leader.

Johnson is a hardworking, ambitious and go-getter farmer who is 57 years of age. He hails from Kianjiru, a small village in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. He comes from a very humble background, and did not manage to attend college, but that did not kill his spirit to succeed. He has actively been involved in farming for the past 10 years. Although he has made great strides in farming, he wants to diversify his farming, and is kindly seeking a loan to buy pigs. \r\n\r\nPig farming is one of the profitable agricultural ventures in Kenya and Johnson, having an entrepreneur's mind, wants to take advantage of that to improve his living conditions. Johnson loves pig farming because pigs are not demanding to keep, unlike poultry, which require special care and attention. Johnson believes that with the loan his life will permanently change because he will be selling pork meat to the ready market that is available. As far as the market of pig products is concerned, demand is greater than supply. Johnson always says, \u201cTo become a successful pig farmer you need three ingredients and that is getting the right breed, giving the right feed, and proper care.\" With the loan he believes he will become a successful pig farmer and be able to realize his dream of transforming his life. Having been farming for the past 10 years, Johnson finds it very enjoyable to raise pigs because he does not spend more money on buying food. Pigs feed on remains that can be collected from hotels and restaurants and hence save a lot of money. Johnson will also sell manure from the pigs and use it on his farm, also saving much more money and improving his living conditions. Profits from selling pig meat to the local market and to the industry that produces sausages and bacon will be used to fully repay the loan.

Married to Dandy Roy, an artist, she has one child who is still in the elementary level. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal, household needs and to send her child to school. \r\n\r\nGemma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all the products are essential household items and food. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells snacks like hotcakes and the native food \"puto\" (steamed sticky rice), favorites among the Filipinos. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 700 PHP (Philippines pesos) a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, flour, sugar, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive about a good return on her investment. Her store earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her child to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nGemma hopes to maintain and grow her business into a canteen someday. She wants to give her child the best education until college.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Rose Ann would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 8,000 PHP, she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rose Ann hopes to maintain an increasing profit from her business. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy.

Meet Zeddiah, a mother of four who has defied the notion among her friends that farming is an old-fashioned way of earning a living. \r\n\r\nHer primary sources of income are milk, eggs and farming. Zeddiah hails from Kisii, Kenya, an area that enjoys favorable weather patterns, and this boosts crop production in the area. \r\n\r\nZeddiah, being someone who is very ambitious and someone who always takes advantage of positive things, would like to capitalize on the good weather patterns experienced in the region and boost her farming. Being a hardworking mother, Zeddiah has always ensured that she puts food on the table for her family. She also ensures she is able to take her children to school. \r\n\r\nZeddiah detests living in conditions of poverty, and she has a plan to improve her standard of living. This is why she is seeking a loan of 20,800 KES (Kenyan shillings) in order to be able to purchase a dairy cow. This will help in producing milk and manure to be used on her farm. Milk from the cow will be sold to the local market, and this means improved cash flow. Through improved cash flow, this means that profits will be higher and she can comfortably take care of her family and take her kids to school. Through your loan, Zeddiah will be empowered economically and be able to improve her standard of living and also that of people living within the area. \r\n\r\nZeddiah is very comfortable with the

","en":"Zebijon is 57 years old. She is a mother of three children and a happy grandmother. Despite the fact that her children are already grown and earn their own living and even help their parents, she does not sit with her hands down and instead tries to work independently, so that she is not relying on her children and is able to help them too. Zebijon's husband is a skilled house repairman and is also involved in his own business. Two of Zebijon's children left for work, and because the children's work is far away from their native land, it is not the best situation for the family, but her children do not have another alternative and need to support their family. This is why Zebijon does not want to be a burden for her children. Zebijon is involved in sewing national women's dresses. To advance her business, she wants to purchase a new sewing machine and, thus, improve her work productivity. Because she has already used Arvand's services and is happy with the service here, she requested this loan. She really hopes to make her dream a reality.

food for her family. Six years down the line, Peninah is deep into commercial dairy and horticultural farming. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, tea and vegetables. The money she makes from her various investments have helped elevate the quality of life led by her two children who are both in school. \r\n\r\nPeninah is seeking a loan to purchase dairy goats and expand her horticultural farm. The crops she grows on her farm are insufficient to fulfill the demand. However, to grow more crops, she needs more land, more farm inputs, more equipment and more labor. Crops aside, the other concern Peninah is dealing with is the shift in preference in the dairy industry. Goat milk demand is on a steady rise in Kenya. As more people in Kenya are levitating towards goat milk because of its nutritional value, cattle farmers are being forced to start adopting dairy goat farming. Caught up in this situation, Peninah will find your loan very handy. With KES 50,000, she will be able to purchase a couple of dairy goats to start with. She is also going to pay for the resources necessary to expand her crop production.\r\n \r\nShe has made a commitment to herself that the money she will make from this investment will go to loan repayment and her children's education. The money will also offset some of the farm expenses. She is certain that your lending will have a very big impact on her life.

She is married to Carlos who serves as a soldier in the Philippine Marines. They have five children, two of whom are already working, two are in High School and the other one is not of school age yet.  She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her four children to school. \r\n\r\nAmy has operated a variety store for 11 years already. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food.  She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 600 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal , soda and other grocery items. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her store earnings are her source to meet their daily expense and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nAmy hopes for her general store to grow bigger. She wants to give her children the best education until college. She dreams of a bright future for her family.

His earned income is not as good as before because of the security situation.\r\n\r\nAli works hard to keep his business up-to-date. Thus, although his region's security situation isn't stable, he is insisting on updating his business as much as he can. He is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner, Al Majmoua, which will be his tenth cycle. The loan will be invested in improving his business through increasing his merchandise to meet new construction demand that will help in rebuilding his region. His previous loans all met with very impressive results, which he is hoping that the current one will achieve.\r\n\r\nHe has worked hard on improving his business gradually. With increased merchandise, he will surely increase his income, and target more construction businessmen and workers with the special offers he provides.

is 61 years old and is a charismatic, active, and attentive man. Being a father has been his main motive for fighting tirelessly day to day to seek alternatives to earn a living and support his children. Approximately 15 years ago, Samuel started doing mixed farming and through those years he has gathered a great deal of experience with farming techniques. Through the income from farming he has been able to take care of his family and also provide for the basic needs for his children. Samuel is a very enterprising man, and although he never got formal employment, he has always worked hard on his farm and he has always provided his family with a decent meal. He lives in the Kerugoya area, which has favorable conditions for horticulture and that is why he is seeking a loan. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, he is sure that he will reap maximum profits and be able to increase his business. \r\n\r\nSamuel is requesting a loan to purchase farm inputs and expand his crops. Being a man from a marginalized community and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Samuel feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising men like him. Samuel is very disciplined with his finances and he plans to use his accumulated profits to improve his living conditions and also secure the future of his children.\r\n\r\nSamuel says that his age doesn't stop him from doing what he is passionate about. That is why he always sets new goals for himself and among them is becoming a great horticulture farmer and generating employment opportunities. In this way, Samuel will be able to improve his quality of life and the well-being of his family and those people who help him do his daily

He started this business activity on his own initiative when faced with the lack of opportunities to get a job with some company.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on, Oscar, with the experience that he got from his father, who taught him everything he knows, has been doing jobs.  He thoroughly fulfills the expectations that his customers have of his work.  In his work he employs a relative, his son.  He wants to teach his son how hard construction work is and that he needs to study in order to aspire to a better life.\r\n\r\nOscar wants to request a loan to buy hand tools like hammers, a container in which to mix cement, a spatula, a shovel, and a sledge hammer, among others.  With the help of this loan he will have tools to speed up his jobs and to make this grueling work a little easier.  \r\n\r\nThrough his work he dreams of being able to improve his sales in order for him to fix his own house; to have a good quality of life; and to allow his son, through his work, to pay for his university studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1715372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy hand tools for construction.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-10-29T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-28T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":73.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.1,"local_amount":122839,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T13:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":127040.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.32,"payment_id":579599622},{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":121095,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":125236.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.88,"payment_id":611815113},{"amount":23,"local_amount":53932,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":55776.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.97,"payment_id":624864796},{"amount":29.27,"local_amount":64493,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":66698.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.98,"payment_id":636622204},{"amount":30.97,"local_amount":65067,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":67292.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.56,"payment_id":649596324},{"amount":30.44,"local_amount":67466,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":69773.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.29,"payment_id":665455577},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":68470,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":70811.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.22,"payment_id":681373588},{"amount":27.18,"local_amount":71711,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":74163.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.68,"payment_id":697631612},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":72912,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":75405.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.04,"payment_id":711501165},{"amount":114.39,"local_amount":292015,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":302001.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.61,"payment_id":731018891}],"funded_date":"2014-11-10T15:37:31Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:14:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":788022,"name":"Zahra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahra is 55 years old and a married lady.

","en":"Juan, 22, owns a salon in the south part of the city.  His mother taught him to cut hair and he started his own business in March of 2012.  However, he'd been a hair stylist long before that, 8 years all together.  Juan is a born entrepreneur and started the business because he knew that he could make a good living with it.  The business is growing, he says, and he now provides all kinds of services in his salon, from cuts to coloring.  His customers are mostly men and women from the neighborhood and he gains new customers from referrals from long-time customers.  He says that the end of the year is especially busy because of the holidays and that he hopes to gain more new customers.  He wants to remodel his salon because he knows he has to keep his customers and one way to do that is to ensure their comfort there.

","en":"Samir operates a tire repair shop in the southwest part of the city.  He is married and has two children, 4- and 1-years old, respectively, and started the business to support them.  Samir learned tire repair from his father when he was just a boy so he long had the skills he needed to start the business.  He can now provide all kinds of tire-related services: sales, repair, and servicing.  His shop is in the neighborhood where he lives.  He buys the products and supplies he needs from wholesalers and distributors and sells his products and services to his customers for cash.  Samir's biggest challenge is ensuring that his customers come back again and again.  The surest way of keeping his customers and attracting new ones, he says, is to deliver a good service at a fair price.  He is applying to Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan that he will use to buy the merchandise he needs--patches, motorcycle tires, lubricants, etc.--to carry on his business.  The investment will allow him to grow his business during the coming holiday season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1714491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for his auto repair business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-10-29T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-28T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":64.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":51173},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66958},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":68967},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":71036},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73167},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":75362},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77623},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79952},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82350},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":103412}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24,"local_amount":51173,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52923.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":595164311},{"amount":31.34,"local_amount":66958,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":69247.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.14,"payment_id":611789207},{"amount":29.4,"local_amount":68967,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":71325.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.08,"payment_id":624849417},{"amount":32.24,"local_amount":71036,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":73465.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.28,"payment_id":636603500},{"amount":12.59,"local_amount":26460,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":27364.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.64,"payment_id":649571713},{"amount":3.31,"local_amount":7408,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7661.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"payment_id":666497085},{"amount":7.35,"local_amount":17333,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":17925.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.32,"payment_id":681350202},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":131315,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":135805.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.28,"payment_id":711475240},{"amount":121.18,"local_amount":309350,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":319929.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.49,"payment_id":730994130}],"funded_date":"2014-10-30T12:44:47Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:24:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":788048,"name":"Rawan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rawan is a 25-year-old university student.

She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 300,000.<br \/><br \/>In the future, Mariatu plans to educate her children to university level and to build a dwelling house for her family. Mariatu is a determined and very hard-working business woman. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1720245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Saidu joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Ummar, Dayyabu and Harazumi. Saidu is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. As a result of his previous loan for inputs, Saidu expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize, double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Saidu would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, in order to receive cash for immediate needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Saidu can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Saidu to generate earnings of up to 1,000 USD\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. When asked, Saidu said, \u201cI would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately, I hope to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1636193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To access a loan to meet urgent expenses, child school fees, food and  farm loan repayment, eliminating pressure to sell corn at low prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-29T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-28T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saidu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":11940,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":11940}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-29T19:14:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":784468,"name":"Teofilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Te\u00f3filo de 65 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa, el se dedica a realizar viajes en su pick up a las diferentes colonias y pueblos aleda\u00f1os desde hace varios a\u00f1os, tiene muchos clientes que lo buscan por la responsabilidad que tiene a la hora de manejar, el est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de  llantas y darle mantenimiento a su veh\u00edculo ya que esa es su herramienta de trabajo y asi poder tener mejores ganancias.","en":"Te\u00f3filo, age 65, lives in his own house with his wife.

Bitrus joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Raimond, Comfort, and Pamela. Bitrus is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. \r\n\r\nAs a result of his previous loan for inputs, Bitrus expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize, double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Bitrus would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to cater to his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Bitrus can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Bitrus to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Bitrus said, \u201cI would like to use this

Yusuf joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Doretty, Precious, and Kabiru. Yusuf is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. As a result of his previous loan for farming inputs, Yusuf expects to reap up to 30 bags of maize per hectare. That is double the national average of 14 bags per hectare.<br \/><br \/>Before he became a Babban Gona member, Yusuf would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to meet his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Yusuf can now store his maize at harvest time. He can sell it a few months later, for a price up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest time. This enables Yusuf to generate earnings of up to $1000 per hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. When asked, Yusuf said:  \"I would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately, I hope to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1720338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to meet his current cash needs, such as food and farm loan repayment, which will eliminate pressure to sell corn at low prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-29T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-28T18:30:07Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusuf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":11856,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":11856}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-29T18:41:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":788262,"name":"Ganchimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ganchimeg, 30 years old, lives with her husband and two daughters in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

the highlands of Guatemala. The highway is often filled with 'chicken buses' that are renovated American school buses, transformed into colorful art projects and packed full of people and, sometimes, their chickens! Nahual\u00e1 is the hub of the area, as nearly all the population lives on the outskirts of the town. \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the population speaks the Mayan dialect of K\u2019iche as their first language and, to a lesser degree, Spanish. Most of the adult population has had little or no education. The people do not have many ways to support themselves and there is a dire economic need. Friendship Bridge is a vehicle of hope for seven ladies in the Trust Bank's 'Esmeraldas Nahual\u00e1 Group' or 'Emeralds of Nahual\u00e1.'\r\n\r\nPreviously, Juana was featured. She needed a loan to purchase yarn for her textile business. Many of the women in the town have textile and handicraft businesses. Juana reports that she has made wonderful progress in her business and was most grateful for the loan. \r\n\r\nFor this report, we would like to introduce Francisca, who is a 40-year-old mother of two children and about to begin her second loan cycle. Francisca is a nurse and also sells medicine. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to increase her inventory of medicine, to meet the demand. She is bilingual and speaks both Spanish and K\u2019iche. In addition, Francisca is from Nahual\u00e1 and well-acquainted with many in the town. Her dream is to create more income and open her own pharmacy.\r\n\r\nThe seven ladies of the Trust Bank's 'Esmeraldas Nahual\u00e1 Group' have enjoyed the participatory educational components of their monthly meetings when a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares useful information that affects the daily lives of the women.  Some topics covered include hygiene, nutrition, health, and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe Microcredit Plus Program of the organization, that combines small loans and education, has proved itself to be an effective way for the women to empower themselves and eliminate poverty.

He attends a university, majoring in economics. He wants to become an accountant at a major oil company in the future. He lives with his parents, who are retired and have a small business. They prepare and sell kebabs. They have many customers because they have been cooking kebabs for several years and have regular clients. But Firdaskhon has other plans.

Her children are four and six and don't go to school yet. Shahnoza works very hard to take care of her family. Three years ago she started a business buying and selling dried fruit, something her mother-in-law helps with. They buy the dried fruit wholesale and then sell it for a profit. \r\n\r\nShahnoza doesn't currently have enough money to continue her business and therefore is looking for a loan.

His monthly salary is 150 AZN (Azerbaijani new manat).\r\n\r\nQuince and persimmon are very popular fruits in Azerbaijan. They are very tasty and useful for health. People use them to make pies or jams for tea. They also use dried quince and persimmon. This is very useful when people get ill. \r\n\r\nThe assortment of fruit trees isn\u2019t wide, and this makes Nemat\u2019s income very low. It\u2019s impossible for a young family to cover life's demands. Nemat wants to provide his son an excellent education and bright future.
