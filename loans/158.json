Tacup, San Remegio, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating two business ventures: food vending and general store businesses.  She has five children who are 6 to 17 years old.  Maria Vita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria Vita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and the education of her children.  Maria Vita B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

L. is from the village of Matugas Alto, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. She is 50 years old. Vivina is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Vivina owns & operates transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating tricycle (three-wheeled vehicle) transport services. Vivina has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vivina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vivina has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC.  Vivina is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase a new transport unit. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Vivina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches  covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

Today, arable lands are undeniably becoming poorer and poorer, and crops are successful less and less.  Now then, his entire life and family depend on these crops.  In order to reap a good harvest, these lands need fertilizer.  His corn plants are stunted.  For these reasons, Mr. A. is requesting a loan of $1000 to buy fertilizers and some pesticides, which will allow him to treat his crops against devastating insects.  A successful season will result in a good harvest.

Or, toute sa vie et celle de sa famille en d\u00e9pendent. Pour donner de bons rendements, ces terres ont besoin de fertilisants. C'est pourquoi Monsieur A. Ablam, vu le niveau actuel de ses plants de ma\u00efs, sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $1000 pour acheter de l'engrais et des produits phytosanitaires qui lui permettront de traiter ces plants contre des insectes d\u00e9vastateurs.

Located directly in front of the butcher section, she is in the perfect place to sell her products. Gladys prepares the condiments daily in her home very early in the morning. She packs these up in tupperware containers and brings it to her stand. She makes ground garlic, red, yellow, and green chili sauces, boiled potatoes, and several additional types of condiments used daily in almost every Ayacuchan household. She also sells other types of ingredients such as milk, butter, cheese, crackers, soy sauce, etc. This is a very common and very convenient type of stand found in a number of the large farmers markets within Peru. <p>\r\n<p>For example, a mother shopping in preparation for the large daily meal at noon can stop by the butcher\u2019s section and order a supply of fresh meat. From there, she can turn around to Gladys, tell her that she will be preparing a beef dish. With this information, Gladys takes a small plastic bag and fills it with a complex mixture of the different types of her condiments to customize the perfect beef seasoning.<p> \r\n<p>Gladys knows exactly how helpful her stand is for her busy customers who are taking care of their children and their homes and also need to prepare a large meal for several hungry mouths. Seven years ago, just before she decided to open up a stand in the market, Gladys was a housewife raising 3 children while her husband worked. When her children grew older, she found she had free time and decided to supplement her husband\u2019s modest income.<p> \r\n<p>One day, Gladys would love to open a grocery store from her home. She is also financing the education of all three of her children. One daughter is studying obstetrics, one is just about to enter the university, and the last is still in middle school. \r\nThere are many reasons Gladys is motivated to expand her business and save money.

Since his childhood, he has never moved Namaacha.\r\n\r\nSalom\u00e3o has worked in subsistence agriculture since 1990.  He has one worker and grows a single crop, cabbage. He receives a monthly pension of 1280 meticais.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan from Hluvuku and his first from Kiva. The first loan was for 10000 meticais and went to buying agricultural inputs--fertilizers to grow quality cabbage.\r\n\r\nSalom\u00e3o plans to repay his loan ahead of time in order to apply for another loan for opening another small farm to diversify his crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The official name of this borrowing group is Janet B..\r\n\r\nJanet is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Janet owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.

Janet is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Janet joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janet is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Janet from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

As the years have passed Julia has felt happy of having made headway for her children, and now she is working hard to continue making progress. To do that, she has a small food store in her home where she offered products of primary need to the people in her community. The extra money, along with the agricultural work she has done for the past 10 years, provides her with good profits, but during times of drought she suffers losses that the store helps cover. Her main crops are peas, potatoes and gladiolus, which after every harvest she sells at her town's local market. During agricultural seasons she travels to the capital to obtain better profits. She is currently planning to purchase more farmland. This is Julia's second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and as a member of her community banks she says she has developed as a businesswoman and has a lot of support to be able to succeed.

She is happily married with eight high-spirited kids. She says the inspiration before she took root in this business came from her close friends.\r\n\r\nOn the side, she ekes out additional income from two other businesses--bricks sales and

Farida is a farmer. She is 45 years old, married, and has one child. Farida puts a lot of enthusiasm into the development of her farming efforts because she is aware that they can help her child. The unconditional support that she receives from her child provides her with optimism, and despite the financial shortcomings at home she tries to alleviate those shortcomings efficiently. Her wish to improve the living conditions of her family brings her to request a loan to increase the quality and quantity of her products. Farida asks 10,000 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

still lives. She is 63 years old.  Tatyana was born in a low-income family and from early childhood, she had to help her parents around the house. \r\n\r\nTatyana got married at the age of 23. Soon she gave birth to two daughters and one son. Her husband served as an inspector in a juvenile colony, and Tatyana got a job as a cleaner in a local school. Their salaries didn\u2019t cover all expenses of the household. In order to support her family, Tatyana decided to start animal breeding. Using the small amount of 1,000 Kyrgyz Soms, she bought goats and rabbits. Later on, her livestock grew and she got milk cows, whose milk she sold to a dairy factory.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Tatyana divorced her husband and became the only breadwinner for her children. During the next five years, Tatyana married her daughters off. In 2006, Tatyana\u2019s son got married; at the same time her grandson was born, which further raised the family\u2019s expenditures. Because of this, Tatyana had to sell most of her cattle. Today she has only 20 rabbits at her farm.\r\n\r\nNow Tatyana is requesting a loan of 30,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy ten pigs and one bull. That will allow her to further develop her household and business. \r\nIn future, Tatyana plans to help her son buy a house. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15, 000 loan.

This is the reason that she makes effort to assure that her business will go smoothly and earn sufficient profits. Denden is married to Benjamin, a barber. They are raising two children who are both in elementary level. Their family resides in Caloocan City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nCapitalizing on the occupation of her husband, Denden has begun her own barber shop and has run it with Benjamin. The shop is located along Araneta Avenue, Quezon City. Having been six years in this business, Den-den learned the strategies in making a barber shop function effectively and gain more customers. She also applies the entrepreneurial trainings she receives from CCT* as she gets encouraged weekly by attending its fellowship* meetings. Every month she is able to earn roughly Php11,000.\r\n\r\nDen-den applies for a loan worth Php20,000 to help her grow her business. This she will utilize by purchasing necessary equipment and materials for the barber shop. Denden also says that part of the loan will go to her savings. She will make sure that all she needs for the optimum functioning of the shop will be purchased so that more profits would go to her savings.\r\n\r\nOne major challenge Den-den faces is demolition in the place where she is supposed to branch out her business. Currently she is devising plans on where to locate her to-be-opened store. This is one step towards her goal of owning both a big salon and a well-known barber shop. She works hard to make this dream happen, because the bottom line is, a successful business will mean sufficient savings to secure the future of her children. It is her ultimate desire to see her children finish their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":768443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Phiona has been working hard to manage her small business which sells fresh produce. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Phiona has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food items for resale, and will help Phiona to generate greater profits and improve her family's welfare. Phiona hopes that in the future she will be able to continue expanding her business. \r\n\r\nPhiona is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They were a humble family with scant resources.  She is 46, and she has three children who are studying so that they can have a better future.  She is married, and her husband works in maintenance.  They live in a very poor neighborhood, which is threatened with violence everyday because of unemployment in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nSince she was ten years old, she has worked as a domestic employee, where she earns a low salary.  This does not allow her to work towards her objective of finishing her house.  In her free time she washes and irons to get other income to be able to cover the food necessities.  The basic necessities are super expensive, and they do not match her salary.\r\n\r\nShe has had eight cycles with Afodenic.  Thanks to the loans she has been able to make improvements.  With the previous loan she bought stones, sand, and iron.  But, she was not able to do anything.  With this loan she will start to change the roof, which is very old and leaks, and make the improvement.

He considered opening his own convenience store, running a gas station, and possibly opening a restaurant. Ultimately, he found a new career that finally put his computer and graphic design skills to use.\r\n \r\nIn 2006 Moe became the new owner of Stop Signs, Inc. \u201cI make signs that go on buildings, road signs, and real estate signs. We do all kind of signs \u2013 illuminated and non-illuminated, including exterior channel letters. We cover the whole sign-making process from \u201cconcept to design to manufacturing.\u201d\r\n \r\nBusiness has been growing for Moe since 2006, but in the past year revenue has stabilized. \u201cWe\u2019re not growing like we used to. But we\u2019re surviving \u2013 we\u2019re keeping our heads above water!\u201d says Moe.\r\n \r\nBut this past summer, Moe\u2019s most expensive piece of equipment \u2013 the lift truck he uses to install large outdoor signs on the sides of buildings \u2013 broke down. Moe went to his local bank for a loan and was turned down, but they referred him to Opportunity Fund, his local microfinance institution. A $10,000 loan will allow Moe to buy a new lift truck so that he can install his signs more quickly and more safely.\r\n \r\nMoe\u2019s dreams for his business are to continue serving his local community with quality designed signs and eventually to franchise Stop Signs, Inc. across the nation. \u201cI am proud that I learned this business and became a master sign maker. It\u2019s so different from what I used to do. But I\u2019m great at it. We can handle any job and I am proud of the risk I took to pursue my dream to be my own boss!\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":438060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tundan 2.\r\n\r\nMerlinda is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Merlinda owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food, such as rice cake \"puto\", babanacue, etc. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling breads to the local community. Merlinda is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Merlinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlinda is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Merlinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It consists of seven female members who know each other and are neighbors. The members are Bibiana Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, who is planning to use her loan to purchase refreshments, tortillas, bread, mayonnaise, peppers, ham, meats, cheese, and other items to make her meals. Florentina Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez plans to purchase refreshments, candies, bread, ham, corn, vegetables and tortillas to prepare her Mexican cuisine. Marcela M. P. plans to purchase sugar, oil, detergent, soups, refreshments and other items to stock her business. Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix Mart\u00ednez F. plans to purchase some sheets and bedspreads to fulfill her orders. Gregoria Hern\u00e1ndez G. plans to purchase live pigs to butcher and sell meat by the kilo. Paula D\u00edaz M. plans to purchase fertilizer for her crops. Nora D\u00edaz Mej\u00eda plans to purchase fabrics, thread, zippers, yarn and other items for her seamstress business.<br>\r\nNora is 37 years old and is a high school graduate. She is married and her husband comes from the country. They have three children: Alejandro is 16 years old and is in his third semester of college; Fernanda is 14 years old and is a junior in high school; and Rafael is 6 years old and in primary school. She has a sewing shop and is requesting the loan to purchase sewing supplies, and she also plans to buy a uniform for her son so he can march in the Nov. 20th parade. She started her business 20 years ago when she was 17 years old. She learned the craft from taking sewing courses in her village, and 10 years ago she and her sisters went to the local vocational school to take painting lessons. Now all her sisters also know how to paint. Her husband bought her a sewing machine and little by little she bought some paints and fabrics. She runs her business out of her home in Marcelino Rodr\u00edguez, Axochiapan. Her business is important because it allows her to help a little with household expenses and doesn't put everything on her husband. What she enjoys most about her work is when she finishes a job and it comes out beautiful, and she feels stimulated to keep making her garments. She knows that although she is a woman she can stand on her own, and she feels proud when her children tell her she does beautiful work. Her daughter has always been interested in helping her, and started making handkerchiefs. Now she keeps making them bigger and prettier. Nora's customers are her friends, neighbors, acquaintances and friends of her daughter, for whom she makes dresses for the school dances. Currently she has about 10 customers. It's a small amount because she is helping her mother at her food stand making Mexican cuisine in the mornings and on the weekends during the months of October, November and December, which is the busiest time of year for her mother's business. Nora's business has competition since there are a lot of people who make a living in sewing, but there is always a way to make money. With her profits she plans to buy some paintings, thread, and save some in case there is an emergency and her family needs a doctor or cover school expenses. She is planning to expand her business, taking out some textile painting jobs with Christmas themes as well as offering Christmas-themed cushions, handkerchiefs, curtains and table cloths. Marcelino Rodr\u00edguez is a village that was formed by plantation workers, and their pottery and antiques still remain. Nora's business has helped her family financially and she is able to paint in her spare time. Her biggest desire is to make improvements to her home by building a door opening up to the street and remodeling a room for her sewing and painting shop. Her dreams are to expand her business and have an industrial sewing machine. She wishes to be able to help provide for her children's education so they can become professionals. Nora feels happy and committed to this loan because she plans to stock up on sewing and painting supplies in order to make cushions, handkerchiefs and curtains with pictures of Christmas, Baby Jesus and the Virgin Mary. <br>\r\nThe members of this group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad that \"we are grateful for the support we are receiving and have confidence we will grow together.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":639116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fabrics, lace, thread, textile paint and other sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"AXOCHIAPAN MOR.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-11-20T04:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Felix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3221.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182555011},{"amount":787.5,"local_amount":9600,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9665.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691502},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6443.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430686},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6443.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849961},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6443.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292239}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T19:48:36Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":252951,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A home is undoubtedly important to everyone, including Evelyn R..

Karena dengan usaha ini Made Susana mampu menambah penghasilan keluarganya sehingga tidak hanya mengandalkan penghasilan suaminya yang seorang petani. Setelah melunasi pinjaman pertama dengan DINARI, Made Susana mampu memperoleh keuntungan bersih Rp.200.000,- per bulannya. Keuntungan ini sangat membantu untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari keluarganya. Selanjutnya Made Susana melanjutkan kerjasama dengan DINARI untuk melakukan pinjaman periode ke II dengan besar pinjaman Rp.6000.000,- jangka waktu 6 bulan serta pelunasan akan dilaksanakan pada akhir periode pinjaman. Pinjaman ini rencananya akan digunakan untuk membeli bibit babi sebanyak 8 ekor dengan harga per ekornya Rp.350.000,-. Nantinya bibit-bibit babi ini ada yang akan dijual per 3 bulan pemeliharaan saja untuk dijadikan daging babi guling. Dan sisa uang pinjaman tentunya untuk membeli pakan babi selama pemeliharaan. Dengan semakin besar pinjaman yang diterima diharapkan keuntungan yang didapat akan meningkat pada waktu panen berikutnya. ","en":"Since she started with DINARI, Ni Made Susana Dewi already raised pigs in her home.

These piglets would be raised and sold after 3 months to be then sold as 'babi guling' ( balinese baby roast pig specialty). The rest would be used to buy feed during raising.

She lives in a polygamous family with her co-wife and their children in the K\u00f4k\u00f4 district of Koutiala prefecture (Region of  Sikasso).  Not having had the chance to go to school, she soon became interested in earning an income at her mother's side.

After four solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, she is now on her first individual loan.  She intends to use this loan to replenish her stock of calabash bowls.  Supplies are procured from producers in the surrounding villages.  Sales are made wholesale in Abidjan (capital of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and retail in the different districts of Koutiala.  Her customers are composed of retailers, women, and men.  Transactions are in cash and sometimes on credit.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to realize a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that she will use to make loan interest payments, to support her family, and to invest the rest in her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

is an enterprising woman with a strong desire to improve the quality of life of her family. She is married and is the loving mother of two children. \r\n<p>\r\nMakhsuda has been a seamstress since she was very young, learning her craft in her mother's office. With a lot of effort, she was able to open her own shop in her home. She has been successful because her customers recognize the high quality of her products.

Makhsuda and her son are especially grateful for your generosity and support.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. Additionally, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

V. Ketti Milagritos\r\n\r\nFor three years I have worked as a small businesswoman making all types of knitting by hand and by machine.  I took some short courses like computer science, sewing and cutting, and weaving at a CEO (Occupational Education Center).  \r\n\r\nAfter separating from my life partner I had to face the expenses alone for my seven year old son, my mother, and myself.  It was indispensable to have a knitting machine, but I did not have the money to get one.  When my brother-in-law saw the effort that I put into the work I made in the shop where I studied, he gave me the tool (knitting machine) to undertake this business.  That is how I started making baby clothes, quilts, layettes, and hats.  I offered them to my friends, they liked my work, and later they ordered more.  \r\n\r\nKnitting is a distraction because I do it on the week ends.  Also, it gives me time to work in my sister\u2019s bookstore.  The earnings from these sales allow me to pay for food, education, and the basic service expenses of my home.  I was also able to get a blender and television.\r\n\r\nI need the loan to buy cones of various colors of thread, buttons, elastic, colored ribbons, and some replacement parts for my machine.  I will sell the items during this Christmas season when there is more demand.       \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":438088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials for knitting with wool and thread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T07:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ketti Milagritos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.86,"local_amount":73.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669121},{"amount":32.59,"local_amount":93.11,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":94.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064583},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":82.99,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899643},{"amount":29.4,"local_amount":84.01,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933726},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661326},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694020}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T11:10:56Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":162215,"name":"Nyongle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Nyongle V. is currently in the business of selling beer and local alcohol and is requesting a loan to stock more crates of beer and bags of charcoal to sell.

Cruz decided to invest in more products and acquired stationery for her business.

Mahawak, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Food Vending (\"Halo-Halo Shaved ice dessert) businesses. Her common-law husband Roland Marijuan is 47 years old and works as a dental technician to earn his living.  She has one child who is 13 years old.\r\n\r\n Ignacia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ignacia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future education of her child and for family needs. \r\n\r\nIgnacia J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

those at risk of becoming homeless. Her passion for economic empowerment within the homeless community sparked a desire to launch a program that provides income opportunities to the homeless through the sale and distribution of biweekly and bimonthly newspapers.  The vendors are able to purchase the newspaper from the program for less than half the sales price and keep the remaining portion as income.\r\n \r\nDelphia chose to open this business because of her experience working with the homeless and at-risk population and her passion for poverty reduction.  Although her business is home-based for now and relies on volunteers, she believes the business will give the homeless an entrepreneurial mindset and have many positive impacts for the homeless population in the city.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from ACCION USA, Delphia will be able to print more newspapers for her flourishing business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information About This Loan \r\n\r\nThis loan has been made as a part of Kiva Detroit and in partnership with Michigan Corps.  Kiva Detroit is the first Kiva City, a program where Kiva works with community organizations and field partners in the United States to provide local small businesses with microloans. Michigan Corps is the first community organization to work with Kiva in Detroit, and conducts outreach through small business networks, churches, community foundations, and across many personal and social media networks.

He is married with 4 children who are all school-going. He buys the clothes in bulk from Nairobi and transports them to Kisumu for retailing. He has been in this business for over 5 years now. One of his primary motivations for choosing this business is because of the readily available market due to the high poverty levels in Kisumu town.\r\n<p>\r\nHe buys his stock every 2 weeks and sells the clothing not only in Kisumu Town but also in neighboring markets on the outskirts of Kisumu. He goes to these markets on their specific market days.\r\n<p>\r\nThe post-election violence in Kisumu Town affected him negatively as it meant he couldn\u2019t sell his clothes for quite sometime. There was, however, an opportunity for him as well in this situation since most people now can\u2019t afford to buy new clothes and have to rely on second-hand clothes for survival. He hopes to take advantage of this opportunity by taking a refinanced loan to enable him to carry on with his earlier business. His business had been making profits before the violence enabling him to frequently restock his business and pay his loan as well. His loan repayments have been on schedule and so have been the group repayments.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has been the secretary for his group and has done a good job particularly in ensuring that the group has its loan balances kept intact. The group has also been cohesive and with good repayment rates before the post-election violence. They see the refinancing as an opportunity to get back to their normal business state as soon as possible.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to being cohesive, the group has had good repayment rates in earlier loans and have been having timely meeting on their rescheduled meeting days. Solomon, in addition to his secretarial duties, has played a huge role in energizing the group through constant faith-based encouragements during the violence period.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\nDisclaimer: Kiva is working with OI-WEDCO to refinance businesses disrupted by Kenya's post-election violence.  The group above has received loans from OI-WEDCO in the past and is now working to rebuild their businesses and to get back on their feet. Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses. Lenders to this entrepreneur should be aware that this loan may represent a higher default risk, and should be willing to accept this additional risk in making their loan.<\/i>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":146114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To reconstruct and expand businesses after post-election violence","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisumu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.1 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":92,"posted_date":"2008-04-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joanes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jared","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dems","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-19T13:32:28Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":205000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":343,"local_amount":21307.58,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T03:23:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":21368.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201923},{"amount":757,"local_amount":47025.76,"processed_date":"2008-06-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":47161.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":242797},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271857},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301114},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331859},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365941}],"funded_date":"2008-04-05T13:32:28Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T04:47:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":47263,"name":"Martina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martina is twenty-five years old and a buddimg entrepreneur.

This is 27-year-old Grace D. from Tukuyu. She is single. Grace has been running a \"genge\" business since 2005. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>\r\n\r\nGrace works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Grace currently earns about 300 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase sugar, rice beans, cooking oil,chili, and and other items for her business. In the future, she plans to increase the variety and quantity of her inventory. Grace thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":256315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":319926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To cultivate Irish potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T13:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam\t  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":301837.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773301}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T15:07:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":112819,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabel S.
