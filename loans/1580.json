San Francisco is a picturesque old town where the people follow the old customs. The economy of the region is based mostly on the cultivation of coffee and bananas.\n\nThe members of this group have businesses such as catalog sales of cosmetics and lotions and shop selling items such as daily necessities, house-made sausage and  clothing. These are hard working, dedicated women eager to learn how to improve their businesses through the business training that Namaste will provide. They will receive classes in financial literacy and each will have a personal business advisor who will help her write a business plan and offer advice on how to grow her business to meet her goals.\n\nOne of the women in this group is Do\u00f1a Aurora (first from left) who is 59, married and the mother of three grown children. She is a seamstress who makes high quality garments. Her husband is a retired teacher and she is the main support of her family. She makes wedding, fifteenth birthday and baptism dresses. Her work is of excellent quality and she is well know in her area and sells dresses through the country and even some internationally.

These much-needed loans were invested in micro-businesses, including the retail sales of beauty items, cleaning supplies, clothing and tortillas. One of the clients, Ingrid, had a convenience store. The 11 ladies are pleased to report that they have finished paying back their loan on time and in the full amount and are ready to take out another one. They are wonderful examples of women who through hard work and dedication, have raised their standard of living and face a brighter future.\n\nPreviously, Ingrid, 40-year-old was featured, who is divorced and the mother of five children. Ingrid needed a loan to purchase maize in quantity for her \u201ctortilleria,\u201d or tortilla shop, that she started just when she received her loan. Today, this hard-working woman is happy to report that the loan has been a huge help to her because she has increased her business, generated more income and improved life for herself and her family.\n\nFor this new loan cycle, Esly, 33-years-old and has two children is member of the group. Esly sells various different edible items including cereals, soups and sausages, as well as snacks called \u201crefacciones\u201d and beauty products. She needs financial capital to purchase inventory for her businesses to take advantage of the holidays and special events including Day of the Dead, graduations and the end of the year. \n\nFriendship Bridge calls the combination of small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus.\u201d Each month, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares pertinent information on topics that affects the women\u2019s daily lives. Through role playing, games and drawings, the ladies learn about how to manage their small loans with information about budgeting, accounting, customer service, marketing and pricing. They learn to care for themselves and their families more effectively with seminars on nutrition, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. Finally, the members of the Trust Bank learn to have self-esteem and that they have a voice, even though they might not know how to read and write.\n\nAll of the women in the Trust Bank \u201cAbril\u201d send special greetings to Kiva investors throughout the world. They want to express their appreciation for the loans. They look forward to a brighter future as empowered women eliminating poverty!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6500,"image":{"id":1715249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy inventory for her different business, including edible products and beauty products.

Investing in a piggery is a good and profitable business, as female pigs conceive twice in a year and can produce as many as 12 piglets each time. They can be sold either to cook \"lechon\" (roasted pig) or to the town market for meat. She also sells jewelry pieces on the side. She earns a minimum of 3,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) a month. \n\nTo help her grow her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan, which she will use to buy more feeds and clean grain for her pigs, and some jewelry items as well. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \n\nLiza hopes for her piggery and jewelry businesses to grow and aims to have her own stall. She prays to have a baby soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies\n\n. * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married and the mother of three children who are all independent and have left home already.  Zebi has been working in agriculture since she was very young and she loves this activity.  Since she was born and raised in a village, she doesn't have a higher education and getting a decent job without an education is very difficult.  But as she says, she is content with working the land and getting a harvest.  At the moment though, she is having some financial difficulties, which is the reason why she has decided to turn to MDO Arvand, LLC for financial support.  Crop prices are very low right now, so Zebi cannot count on her earnings from her harvest to buy seeds toward a future harvest.  For this reason, she has decided to take a loan to buy seeds.

As a result of her previous loan for inputs, Rashila expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize; double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare.

He had always liked business and he wasn't very happy until he started his own 4 years ago. During that time, he has sold replacement parts, tire inner tubes, headlights, and motorcycle accessories. He sells things for cash [not on credit]. He works every day from 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening. David's main customers are motorcyclists, who are abundant in the neighborhoods and who offer informal transportation services.

Her income, combined with her husband's, is barely enough to cover their family's increasing needs, especially the education fees.

Before he became a Babban Gona member, Samaila would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to cater for his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. \r\n\r\nWith this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Samaila can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Samaila to generate earnings of up to $1,000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Samaila said: \u201cI would like to use

This is how Emilio feels.  He is 51 and married.  He is asking for a new loan to invest once again in his potato crops.\r\n\r\nOther loans he has used, offered by other organizations, have not offered the same benefits as this one, such as the method of payment, monthly interest rates and the capital left when the loan expires; all of these are advantages that help people dream of a better future for their families.\r\n\r\nThe use that Emilio would give this second loan is to buy potato seeds and organic manure so that he can start to grow more produce and then sell them in the local market.  This will help him generate more income and take care of his family so that they have suitable living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe change that the loan makes means that the supplies allow him to take care of the harvest and manage his agricultural crops in general.  This in turn leads to better quality produce, which is exactly what Emilio has found; the loans mean better harvests.\r\n\r\nOne of his goals is to build homes for his children so that they have suitable living conditions and also that they complete their studies so that they can grow up to become working professionals.  He would also like to continue harvesting fertile lands in his area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1715453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and organic compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T06:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T06:30:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":184.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":190.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":192.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":196.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":204.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":205.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":210.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":213.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":219.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":223.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":227.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":232.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.83,"local_amount":184.53,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":197.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579463982},{"amount":324.17,"local_amount":2315.47,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2476.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070664}],"funded_date":"2014-10-31T17:04:25Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T10:45:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":788511,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen lives in Kitale.

As a result of her previous loan for crop inputs, Rahila expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize. That is double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare.<br \/><br \/>Before she became a Babban Gona member, Rahila would have had to sell her maize for low prices soon after harvest, to meet her immediate cash needs, such as food and clothing. With this new loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Rahila can now store her maize at harvest time. She will be able to sell it a few months later, for a price up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This will enable Rahila to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

This allows Andrawus Adamu to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Andrawus Adamu said, \u201cI would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately I hope to make more money for myself and my family.\"\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1627449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to meet urgent expenses, child school fees, food and  farm loan repayment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T16:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T16:20:08Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrawus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":21353,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":21353}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-30T18:57:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Allen","image":1340661}},{"id":788560,"name":"Evans","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evans is a bold farmer dedicated to the world of the land which he inherited from his parents. He gets up very early in the morning and works until the sun sets. \r\n\r\nHe is a 34 year old veteran who only wants to serve his community with his healthy crops. He is blessed with three children who are his greatest motivation in life to persevere, because he wants to provide them a better future. \r\n\r\nEvans was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that his family faced. However, he never gave up and he has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Evans always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d  Because of how much he likes farming he has even nicknamed one of his cows which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cow. \r\n\r\nThrough his dairy cow, Evans is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps him support his family. Evans also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nEvans is very visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. \r\n\r\nEvans believes that through the loan, he will turn around his family life and be able to give his children a solid educational background. This loan will be Evans way out of

This allows Rahila to generate earnings of up to USD 1,000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Rahila said, \u201cI would like to use this additional income to educate my children and, ultimately, I hope to ensure other members of my community are lifted out of poverty.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1720963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to access a loan to meet urgent expenses, children's school fees, food, and  farm loan repayments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":9515,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":9515}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-30T17:07:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":788568,"name":"Mylene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mylene is a married woman from Palompon, Leyte.

They meet in the Santiago II central office.  This group has 8 members, and is led by a board of directors where Antonia is the president. The members of this group have a variety of businesses, including: selling wool and aprons, selling jackets, selling wool sweaters, selling traditional style skirts, selling children's jackets, and selling sports clothes.\r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit all of the small businesswomen in this group.  Antonia states that she joined Pro Mujer 4 years ago at the invitation of a friend who was a client of the institution.  Now she has a business selling fringes and braids for blankets.  She learned this business from her mother a number of years ago, because she used to help her in the family business.

Daniel, 32, started farming approximately 11 years ago, and although he began farming as a hobby, it eventually became his career. His half-acre of land, located in the Kenyenya area of Kenya, houses poultry and dairy cows.<br \/><br \/>Daniel passionately loves dairy farming. The Kenyenya area is populated, and has a ready market for dairy products. Daniel's biggest challenge is feeding his cows, which is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used in cutting hay into smaller pieces, before it is mixed with other kinds of forage. This helps the animal's digestion and prevents the animal from rejecting any part of the food. Through this loan, Daniel will double his milk production.<br \/><br \/>Daniel has faced challenges trying to obtain financing. Now he feels relieved, knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva are there, to make his dream come true. Daniel chose Juhudi Kilimo, because the interest rate on their loans is low, and is on a reducing basis. Daniel underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through the loan, Daniel's income will increase and his life will permanently change, leading to better living conditions for his family and a positive impact to the

This allows Matiyu to generate earnings of up to USD 1,000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Matiyu said, \u201cI would like to use this additional income to educate my children and, ultimately, I hope to become the most profitable farmer in my community.\"\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1626466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to access a loan to meet urgent expenses, children's school fees, food, and  farm loan repayments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matiyu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":19029,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":19029}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-30T21:45:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":785104,"name":"Reinaldo Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Al hablar de Reinaldo se puede evidenciar que es un hombre muy trabajador y servicial que todo lo que hace es en bien de su familia y bienestar de la misma.\n\nEl vive en una humilde casa en el municipio de Barbosa, C\u00f3rdoba donde convive con su esposa y sus 4 hijos por los cuales ha luchado para darles una vida digna y una educaci\u00f3n de calidad.\n\nEl se gana la vida con la cr\u00eda, compra y venta de pollos de engorde y gallinas, tiene plena fe en su negocio y est\u00e1 decidido a cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener casa propia.\n\nEs un individuo trabajador, constante y muy amante de sus hijos.\nEl solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar Pollos y gallinas para su negocio.\n\nEl tiene la esperanza de poder encontrar ayuda en las personas de coraz\u00f3n solidario.\n\n","en":"Speaking with Reinaldo it becomes obvious that he is a very hardworking and helpful man and that everything he does is for his family's benefit and wellbeing.

The land has been blessed by hands that enjoy working with it and caring for it, it's an admirable profession that women have put years and entire lives into. Without the labor of farm women dedicated to working it, the land wouldn't bear the fruits that have supported every generation. She's 45 years old, single, and has five children. Two of them have their own separate families and the younger three are students at a local school.\r\n\r\nThe work that Isabel does is planting corn, beans, and thyme to subsequently sell them at the local market to obtain income for she and her family to improve their quality of life. She has been doing said work for 20 years and it has generated good profits.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to purchase fertilizers to boost her crop production so she and her family can have satisfactory living conditions. One of Isabela's biggest dreams is to plant 4 units of corn so that she can sell much more than she does now, and that way have income to fix her house and pay for her children's schooling so that they can become professionals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1716280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra

They have formed this group to strive for their own financial independence by promoting their businesses through loans. \r\n\r\nHoineilhing is the featured borrower of the group, pictured with her hand raised. She is a courageous woman who looks after her four school-going children alone as her husband serves in the army. \u201cOur family meets once a year, only when my husband is home for the holidays and those are the happiest days for our family,\u201d she said. \r\n\r\nHoineilhing runs a grocery shop to earn income in her village situated in the hills that is very far from Imphal town. There are about 65 households in their village and most of them are engaged in agricultural activities as their main occupation. Hoineilhing buys stocks of items needed for her shop from the nearest town and earn a small profit by selling them in her village. The profit she makes is spent for her children's school fees and other household expenditures. Apart from that, her husband also sends her money to meet the household requirements but the amount barely meets their needs. \r\n\r\nSince her household expenditure increases, Hoineilhing cannot afford to buy inventory for selling anymore and her shop is on the verge of closing down.

This is the first time that she has joined Pro Mujer, and she joined at the invitation of one of the institution's promoters who visited her at her home. She currently has a business making and selling french fries and chicharrones. She learned this business from her mother many years ago and, since she helped at her family's business, she decided to start her own business.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to increase her capital and she will purchase potatoes and oil in bulk from sellers in La Paz, then make her products, then sell them to her customers. Her job allows her to generate income to support her family; she is married and has five children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the office, the training, and the loans that the institution offers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1716298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase oil and potatoes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T20:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T20:00:01Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felisa Albertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nildon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenobia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Patricia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20576,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3243.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3291.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3381.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3473.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3569.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3617.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":472.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":520.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":527.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":952.78,"local_amount":6534.84,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6583.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579575123},{"amount":2047.22,"local_amount":14041.16,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":14145.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595168948}],"funded_date":"2014-10-31T19:47:16Z","paid_date":"2015-01-17T13:04:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meghan Rishel","image":1056096}},{"id":788653,"name":"Benedetta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benedetta is a 43-year-old woman married to Pius, who adds additional income to support their family welfare.

He has been practicing crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nPeter is very visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year.

Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business since the demand for poultry products is always high.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Daniel  Ahmed can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Daniel  Ahmed to generate earnings of up to $1,000 per hectare, which is more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Daniel  Ahmed said, \u201c I would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately, I hope to ensure other members of my community are lifted out of poverty.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1631651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"meet urgent expenses such as child school fees, food costs and  farm loan repayment, thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn at low prices and increasing his income by up to 37%.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T22:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T22:10:13Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":29641,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":29641}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-31T04:30:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":788739,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is married and has four children, all of whom attend school.

Haruna joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Nata'Ala, Kyauta and Basira. Haruna is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. \r\n\r\nAs a result of his previous loan for inputs, Haruna expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize; double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Haruna would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest in order to cover his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. \r\n\r\nWith this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Haruna can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Haruna to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Haruna said, \u201cI would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately, I hope to become the most profitable farmer in my community.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1625946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To store his corn crop and sell later, increasing his income by up to 37%.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haruna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":29850,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":29850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-10-31T09:52:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":788744,"name":"Nerilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Nerilyn works hard to support her family.

Sus compras las realiza a mayoristas especializados en droguer\u00edas, con el fin de lograr seguridad en su compra y buenos precios.  Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es ampliar sus ventas, para poder comprar su vivienda, aunque su mayor desaf\u00edo sea la fidelizaci\u00f3n de su clientela, con precios competitivos y un magnifico servicio al cliente. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 medicinas variedades y jugueter\u00eda, con el firme prop\u00f3sito de aprovechar la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o y lograr incrementar sus ventas, como es su costumbre en esta magn\u00edfica \u00e9poca comercial. ","en":"Leidys, 33, owns a pharmacy in the southwest part of the city where she lives with her spouse and her three children, ages 11 through 17.\n\nShe started her business in 2012 after her husband suggested she open a business similar to the work he was familiar with, because he worked in a drug store where he learned administrative management.  To earn her own income, Leidys decided to start her own business venture selling pharmaceutical products directly in a space located in her home.  She works every day from 7 in the morning until 7 at night.  She sells in cash to her customers, who are mainly from the neighborhood.  She buys products from wholesalers who specialize in drug stores so she has security in her purchases and good prices.\n\nLeidys's long-term goal is to expand her sales so she can buy her house.  Her biggest challenge, however, is customer loyalty, with competitive prices and excellent customer service.\n\nLeidys is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She's going to buy medicine, accessories, and toys.  She's determined to make the most of the end-of-year season and increase her sales, as is customary during this wonderful shopping season.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1714471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to

His chicken seasoning doesn\u2019t just capture the taste of fried chicken, but serves as a heathier alternative to the real thing. \n\n\u201cFried chicken is delicious, but you also have to consider the health factors in consuming it,\u201d Malek said. \u201cYou can still enjoy your favorite foods, because there is always a healthier way to prepare them.\u201d\n\nFor the last seven years, Malek has worked on his signature chicken recipe. A little over a year ago, Malek started his company, Ames Fried Chicken, in Houston, Texas. His business is packaging and preparing fried chicken seasoning without using butter, oil, eggs or milk. He got his start by packaging his seasonings and selling them to various restaurants. Today, Malek is baking up his own chicken. \n\n\u201cMy chicken is a bit different,\u201d Malek said. \u201cIt has all the great taste of regular fried chicken, but far less grease.\u201d\n\nMalek came to Accion Texas Inc. to help fund the marketing for his business. In the future, he plans to hire more employees. Ultimately, he wants his business to grow into a franchise. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little over a year and I\u2019ve made so much progress with my business,\u201d Malek said. \u201cI am selling more than just chicken\u2014I\u2019m feeding people my dreams every day.\u201d\n\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1715382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married to Bonifacio and has one child. She manages her own household and works to provide income to meet their daily household expenses.\r\n\r\nLeodita makes and sells native delicacies such as \"puto\" and \"kutsinta\"(sweet sticky rice cakes). These are commonly eaten for snacks and also for desserts. She sells them personally around her town, and she also accepts orders during holidays. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. \r\n\r\nAside from selling native delicacies, she also has a piggery in her backyard. She earns a minimum of PHP 200 from her rice cakes every day and PHP 4,000 a month from her piggery business.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue with her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan, which she will use to buy raw ingredients such as sticky rice, flour, sugar, coconut milk, and also to buy a baby pig. She is positive of a good profit on her investment. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nLeodita aims to have a stall of her own for her native delicacies and a stall in the market to sell fresh pork. She dreams to own a vehicle to easily transport her rice cakes and fresh meat to the town market.

He is excited about his new business, which is selling mobile phone airtime to his community. \r\n\r\nAs the business runs, he hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva in order to provide access to mobile services for his community by processing airtime transactions on the weekends. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Usman is in his small stall. He thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1717969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to provide mobile services in his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-10-30T23:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-29T23:20:11Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.97,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Usman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":594.03,"local_amount":7000000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":7217299.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.97,"payment_id":731159914}],"funded_date":"2014-11-18T17:33:40Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T16:52:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":788791,"name":"Tropia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph, who is in his mid 40s, is married with four children, two of them are at school and two are still small.

","en":"Mar\u00eda Renee was born in Yacuiba, a province located in the department of Tarija, Bolivia. She is the youngest of four siblings. When she was fifteen years old, she got married and had a daughter. Some time later, she got divorced and moved to Argentina, where she lived for more than 30 years. During this time, she was working sporadic jobs whose income only covered her household expenses, so she could never go to school.  When she found out her mother, who was 90 years old, was in poor health and needed a lot of care and medicine, she decided to return to Bolivia. She began to work for a company selling trip insurance and take classes at night in Business Engineering.\r\nMar\u00eda Renee's current income only covers her household needs, which is why she is seeking this student loan to finish her studies and achieve her greater dream of having a diploma and opening her own consulting firm on foreign business. She concludes that this will provide the economic stability that she needs to continue helping her mother and at the same time supporting her daughter as needed.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Renee would like to thank in advance all the people who, through their own economic resources, help others and generate new opportunities for growth, such as the one she is seeking
