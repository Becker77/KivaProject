Before he became a Babban Gona member, Barnabas would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest in order to receive cash for his immediate needs. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Barnabas can now store his maize at harvest and sell it for up to 40% higher than the prices at harvest time. This allows Barnabas to generate earnings of up to 1,000 USD\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

After school, I'd stop by the workshop of a local wood carver, Salihu, to observe him and his workers as they carved different objects out of raw wood. They really caught my attention, and I visited the workshop daily. Realizing my interest, Salihu offered to train me. I was most interested, so learning the skill was not a difficult thing. Within a short time, I could finish the carved items. At a certain point in time, my parents could not afford to further my education so I decided to continue learning under Salihu and pursue a career in this field. What inspires me most is when people express appreciation for my designs. It is my dream to one day become the owner of a well-established art workshop and be able to employ many workers to reduce the alarming rate of unemployment in my country.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I thank you so much.

This is Faith. She is the Head Teacher of Mother Care Nursery & Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-Urban area of Mukono town in Mukono district with 177 students. Mother Care School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nMother Care School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Faith ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1724298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2014-10-31T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-30T05:00:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":47.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mothercare School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-29T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":609756.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624862488},{"amount":202.33,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":609756.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.67,"payment_id":681370774},{"amount":200.16,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":609756.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":24.84,"payment_id":755507050}],"funded_date":"2014-10-31T15:47:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":789081,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is a 39-year-old married male living in Masindi, Uganda.

Juana and Manuel have been married for 40 years and have four children, all of whom are adults with their own family. Juana, Manuel, and Santa formed a group to ask VisionFund for a loan. They have been manufacturing cardboard sheets for 14 years. This product is widely used throughout the country, mostly for making roofs for animal pens, but also sometimes for houses. Manuel tells us that he used to work in a factory that made cardboard sheets when he was young. He worked there for 23 years and then decided to start his own business together with his children. The family collect paper and cardboard from refuse in great quantities, then steep it in water, mix the resulting paste, and press it into 2x2 metres cardboad sheets that are put to dry. The last step is to coat them with paraffin in order to make them more resistant. All that is left is then to pack them in order to sell them. Manuel currently does not have a wholesaler that would buy his product in bulk, and the biggest problem he faces is the cost of some of the materials he needs for his product. However, he has an advantage, and that is that he know the machinery inside and out and can therefore perform maintenance and repairs on it himself. Though Manuel might be of respectable age, he still wishes to innovate and find a new market. He needs to buy new rollers and a press, which is why he asks for a loan. In the picture, the members pose in front of the fountain of one of the towns of their state.

She would like to invest in a purchase of raw materials, including sterling silver and marcasite, for her designs.\r\n\r\nNarinee has been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I have a special fascination for marcasite jewelry. The glistening stone allows me to create and design thousands of patterns. My inspiration comes from all that impresses me, like the exotic shape of a flower, the intricate patterns on lace, and small pretty animals. I am not a business woman. Sometimes I don't understand how business works. However, I choose my way to design and sell it. So I need to adjust my thinking and find a way to make art and business get along well. This is quite a challenge for me.

She has a high school education and is well respected among her neighbours, who call her a kind and hardworking woman. She has been working in agriculture for 20 years as the primary source of income for her family, and currently has 0.22 hectares of land where she grows potatoes for sale. Organic, flavourful produce is in great demand. She started her business with 5,000 KGS and thanks to her hard work now brings in around 7,000 KGS per month, which serves as the main means of covering food and everyday living expenses for her family. Her husband is a war veteran, and he and her son actively help with the business.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Mavlyuda has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase seed potatoes and mineral fertilizers to amend the soil. She plans to put profits from the loan into further developing her business and in the future wants to purchase more land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1721566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seed potatoes and fertilizer to cultivate her land and grow organic vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aravan village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-10-31T16:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-30T16:50:13Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.16,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavlyuda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3832},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3720},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3813},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3908},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4006},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4106},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4209},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4314},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4422},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4532},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4646},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4492}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.63},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":348.49,"local_amount":19360.69,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":19543.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579489361},{"amount":49.23,"local_amount":2735.21,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2760.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436560},{"amount":150.02,"local_amount":8621,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8702.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.16,"payment_id":636161402},{"amount":110.03,"local_amount":6113,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6170.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995554},{"amount":237.07,"local_amount":13170.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":13294.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500190}],"funded_date":"2014-11-02T02:57:30Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":785789,"name":"Bonswendtelgo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme AMINATA est la repr\u00e9sentante du groupe BONSWENDTELGO.

They know one another well and live in large traditional families with their husbands, children, and other relatives. They average 42 years of age and have at least six children. This group of women does commerce in a variety of goods, such as clothing and cosmetics, and they work in food service. \r\n\r\nTo expand their businesses, the group members had decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program. They are on their 6th group loan. \r\n\r\nBintou, a member of the group Benkadi, is the one sitting at the end on the right. A vendor of cosmetics, she intends to use her loan to purchase some cosmetic products (soap, ointment, lotion, cream) of various types in quantity over time to sells retail to a diverse customer base. She procures her supplies at the market. \r\n\r\nWhile the other members of the group Benkadi plan on making an average profit of 170,000 francs CFA each over the course of this cycle, Ms. Bintou plans on making 185,000 francs. \r\n\r\nIn addition to paying back the loans, the group members use part of the revenues to cope with personal expenses and to increase their business capital. They would like to see bolstered this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso, so that their inventory levels do not drop too low. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1717424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase cosmetic products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-10-31T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-11-30T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":52.12,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barakissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":266666.66,"processed_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":269754.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758581},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":134877.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319182},{"amount":257.44,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-27T10:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":134877.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.06,"payment_id":610752935},{"amount":237.42,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":134877.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.08,"payment_id":624542686},{"amount":240.52,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":134877.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.98,"payment_id":636515707}],"funded_date":"2014-11-02T14:38:29Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T14:04:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":786386,"name":"Humaira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Humaira is 30 years old, married, and a responsible housewife. \r\n\r\nHer husband is an educated man and has been running a school in his community.

The group has a savings account and participates in group activities to generate income. They have had their businesses for 8 years, have sought loans and know how to work together as a group. They form the Executive Board and this is their third loan cycle. <br \/><br \/>For this loan we introduce the president, Katia. Her work and effort have enabled her to have a business selling general merchandise (clothing, shoes, perfumes, and other items).  The loan is going to contribute to the improvement of the working conditions of the group, enabling them to invest for the end of the year and new year's seasons, increasing inventory and covering the orders that come in during this season which is very good for business. They make weekly payments which allows for flexibility and they promise to pay back completely in 12 months. <br \/><br \/>Some of the women are heads of their respective households, like Diana, who sells clothing, shoes, and sandals in the area of San Jose, and she has a large customer base. She is 27 years old and a hard-working and respected woman in her community, supporting two sons. In addition to her business she attends all the group's meetings. She dedicates 6 hours per day to her business.
