Thanks to Zulaika's hard work, today her business contains 15 different-age cows and 1.35 hectares of land, where she grows potatoes and carrots for sale. The monthly income amounts to about 20,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Zulaika requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 2 cows and mineral fertilizers to treat the soil, which will allow her to develop her business and result in an increased profit.

The other daughter wants to be like her, and she is teaching her so that she can learn a trade and work from home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":745.45,"image":{"id":1717701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To rebuild a wall that collapsed during a recent earthquake in the country.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-01T05:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-01T05:40:08Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":54.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":60.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":58.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":61.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":62.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":70.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":72.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":73.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":77.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.69,"local_amount":109.69,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":109.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146019},{"amount":127.34,"local_amount":127.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":127.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833174},{"amount":48.14,"local_amount":48.14,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":48.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200943},{"amount":141.85,"local_amount":141.85,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":141.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802601},{"amount":104.27,"local_amount":104.27,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540324},{"amount":69.1,"local_amount":69.1,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":69.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730974492},{"amount":145.06,"local_amount":145.06,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752063067}],"funded_date":"2014-11-30T23:41:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":789544,"name":"Sarom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarom is 61 years old.

Omurgul needs to build a warm barn for her livestock and prepare for the winter. She does not think that she needs to sell livestock to build the barn, and this is why she requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy cement, gravel and other building materials.

This was the highest grade they taught where she lived. She would have had to have moved to the city to continue her studies, but her family's resources did not permit this. Rosa is a single mother with a huge desire to help her children get ahead. Her 12-year-old daughter is in the fourth grade and the 8-year-old is in the second grade, while her other children are not in school yet. She rents her home since she does not have her own home to live in. \r\n\r\nRosa has run her own business making tortillas for the last six years. The need to bring home an income led her to take action, since she is the main source of income for her children. When she saw that tortilla-making helped and generated earnings, she decided to continue with it. She is also a housekeeper. \r\n\r\nRosa's tortilla stand is just outside her home, in a well-travelled area, which means that her sales are pretty good. She doesn't have to commute because the business is nearby. She begins her day at 4:00 am, preparing the maize, then goes to the mill. She starts sales at 9:00 am and finishes at 3:00 pm.\r\n\r\nRosa is requesting this loan in order to purchase two quintals of maize and a load of wood, since it is the primary material for making tortillas. The best that the loan will do is make it possible to purchase the necessary inputs for her activities. Rosa's dream is to continue to grow her sales, and thereby make better earnings in order to help her children to get ahead. She hopes to support them through their studies as much as she is able to economically, which will provide them with more stability and a different lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1717719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase two quintals of maize and a load of wood, the primary materials for her work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-01T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-01T10:40:01Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545618}],"funded_date":"2014-11-01T11:28:00Z","paid_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aesclinn Donohue","image":1310197}},{"id":783364,"name":"Scovia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Scovia is a married mother of five children and three go to school.

He has been running an auto rickshaw for the last six years. \r\n\r\nFor many days now his rickshaw hasn't been working properly because it has been used so regularly. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. \r\n\r\nTherefore Nazia has requested for a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

Therefore she has applied for a Kiva loan through its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her to purchase these above accessories and also will help her to increase her monthly sales and profit by providing better sewing services.\r\n\r\nHumaira is very thankful to

She is single with three children, all of whom go to school. She takes care of additional family members. Margret lives in a rented house and her family has access to piped water and electricity. Her monthly expenses include school fees and food.\r\n\r\nMargret operates a retail business selling new bags, clothes and shoes in a shop that she rents.

This loan will help Justiniano to improve farming production as he will have the chance to grow the crops on time. He will then earn a better living and will be able to eat better. \r\n\r\nJustiniano's dreams are to have his own business where he can sell the products that he grows. His dreams for his family are to continue supporting them so that they may achieve their dreams.

Pakistan.\r\n\r\nHer husband owns a bakery in their hometown; he sells different kinds of cakes, fresh cream cake, rusks, milk, biscuits, and juices. He purchases the inventory in large quantity from a nearby bakery and sells it from  his own bakery. Now he wants to offer additional different types of sweets to his customers but does not have a sufficient amount to buy these additional sweets. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Nazish has requested a loan so that her husband  can buy his desired bakery items to sell. His wish is to prepare these bakery items at home so that he can minimize the cost and maximize the income as well. He will start to put aside savings with the profit amount and hopes in future he will prepare all sweets by himself. \r\n\r\nNazish thanks Kiva and field partner, BRAC Pakistan.

is a responsible mother of six children.

Kishwar's husband needs to make repairs to his vehicle because the current condition of his van is not good. Due to insufficient funds, he is unable to maintain his vehicle. Therefore, Kishwar has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Kishwar's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily. In this way he can provide better transportation services to earn a  profitable income. Kishwar also plans to save some of the profit from her husband's income to meet her family's needs in the future.

His general store is very famous in the town and that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relations his sales have increased a lot but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Sumaira requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits etc. Sumaira thanks Kiva and its field partner

Her spouse and daughter actively help her with the farm work. Sonungul has a secondary education. Since she was eighteen, she has been farming which is the main source of income for her family. Thanks to her hard work Sonungul's farm now has two dairy cows and one bull. Also she has a 1.35 hectare parcel of land where she grows alfalfa. Her monthly income from the business is about 9,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, she turned to the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy one cow and one bull. Sonungul plans to invest profits from the loan into developing her business. In the future, this will help her repair her home and buy furniture. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1721605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy one cow and one bull-calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-11-01T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-01T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.46,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonungul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5113},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4429},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4676},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4804},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4936},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5072},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5211},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5355},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5653},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4699}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":170.96,"local_amount":9542,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":9587.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436565},{"amount":81.52,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4571.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751545},{"amount":83.78,"local_amount":4676,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4698.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799254},{"amount":83.2,"local_amount":4804,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4826.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.87,"payment_id":636161408},{"amount":88.44,"local_amount":4936,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4959.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513806},{"amount":90.87,"local_amount":5072,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5096.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995559},{"amount":91.83,"local_amount":5211,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5235.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.54,"payment_id":681290967},{"amount":95.94,"local_amount":5355,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5380.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500195},{"amount":261,"local_amount":15854,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":15929.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.05,"payment_id":711411152}],"funded_date":"2014-12-01T10:05:48Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:03:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":788362,"name":"Shameem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shameem is 48 years old and an active borrower with BRAC Pakistan.

He is the only one responsible to feed the entire family and manage the household.\r\n\r\nKalsoom's husband needs to purchase different types of dry fruits for reselling purposes so that he can increase the size of the business, improve his sales growth, and earn maximum profit. But due to an unfavorable financial position, he is not in the condition to purchase fruits for his business purposes. Therefore, Kalsoom has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that she can help her husband to purchase the above items for business purposes.\r\n \r\nShe is very thankful to

She shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and their children.  Her two oldest children attend school.\r\n\r\nHer need to improve her family's quality of life led her to form a communal bank with other business people so that they could obtain loans.  The members of this group have businesses selling food, selling sweaters, knitting baby clothes, selling fried potatoes, selling sports clothes, a neighborhood store, and a butcher shop.  This is their first loan cycle, and they already have a year of experience with their businesses.\r\n\r\nJessica dreams of having her own shop where she could provide her customers with greater comfort.  She wants to invest in her business so that she can expand it.  She will purchase 2 sets of tables and chairs so that she can attract more customers.

She has been looking after her children alone since the death of her husband. She is very brave, and in 1990 began selling smoked fish for a living. Owing to a slump in sales, she changed business and opened a restaurant not far from her home. Agbessi is very friendly and her customer base keeps on growing. In order to ensure that the demand for her business keeps on growing, she is seeking a loan to buy a bag of corn, fish and condiments. The profits that she generates will enable her to improve her children's quality of life.

Hashimu joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Awaisu, Bauhinia and Musa. Hashimu is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. As a result of his previous loan for inputs, Hashimu expects to reap up to 30 bags\/hectare of maize (double the national average of 14 bags\/hectare). Before he became a Babban Gona member, Hashimu would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to meet his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Hashimu can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. This allows Hashimu to generate earnings of up to $1000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income. When asked, Hashimu said: \u201c I would like to use this additional income to educate my children, and ultimately, I hope to ensure my children are educated and have professional jobs.\"\r\n  \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1629194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to meet urgent expenses, eliminating pressure to sell corn at low prices ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-01T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-01T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hashimu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":17245,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":17245}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-01T19:50:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":789591,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is 45 years old and married with two children, one of whom is in school.<br \/><br \/>She earns a living by raising livestock in the Philippines.

Gulsada has a college education in teaching. She earns the primary source of income for her family by raising animals and farming. She started 19 years ago by buying 10,000 som (KGS) worth of animals. Thanks to her tireless work she today owns two milk cows, one steer, and a large, 12 hectare plot of land where she grows clover each year for use on her farm and for sale. Gulsada sells environmentally clean products and delicious fresh milk to local residents. Gulsada's husband helps on the farm as well as pasturing animals and providing transportation services for people. Gulsada earns an average of 40,000 som (KGS) per month from the business. In order to further develop the business, Gulsada approached the Bai-Tushum bank for a 150,000 som (KGS) loan to buy two dairy cows to increase production of milk. Gulsada plans to save money to buy a new house for her family.

Pramodini owns a poultry farm at her home. \u201cI started a poultry farm since it is a good choice to exercise my skills and earn instead of depending totally on my husband\u2019s income, which scarcely meets our needs,\u201d she said. Four years ago she constructed her own poultry coop at home using bamboo and using her expertise. It was low cost and she has been using the same coop since then. She provides school fees, medical expenses, household expenses and joined the local banking within friend circles with the profit she makes by selling the fully grown chickens. There are also unfortunate business times when the chickens die, and she has a loss. Now she hopes to broaden her business by building more coops and buying more chickens to raise. She also needs to buy a stock of fodder for the chickens. With the Kiva loan, she will buy a stock of fodder and more chicken to raise them. She will sell the chickens when they are fully grown and use the profit for her daughters\u2019 educational expenses and poultry business. She is looking forward to the next loan. She says, \u201cthank you so much\u201d to the lenders. The rest of the group members are working hard to meet their business goals and strive for their own financial freedom with their best capability.

Even with savannah plains and little human activity, there exists a farm that stands tall, a farm with over 2 high-pedigreed Fresian cows, producing over 20 liters of milk. It\u2019s quite an outstanding feat, considering the harsh terrain and other handicaps, like the lack of electricity from the national grid and also having to be dependent on traditional methods of harvesting water. \r\n\r\nKiva lenders, meet Charles, the man credited with the success story of the farm. He is a loving husband and has been farming for the past 10 years. Charles passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that he knows his cows, each individually, because he works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. He and his wife have even named one of them \u201cLelmet\u201d. Because he loves the cows, he runs his operation by four simple rules that have kept him and his herd happy. The rules are: breed them well, feed them well, clean them well and milk them well. \r\n\r\nHis primary source of income has been milk, eggs, vegetables  and some personal business that he engages in to make ends meet. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve. He is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Juhudi Kilimo serves poor smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to the farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like dairy cows, motorbikes, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. Charles source of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kericho area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Charles is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Through the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Charles is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. All that Charles waits for is your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":726.8,"image":{"id":1722276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

life. They are engaged in different occupations, namely embroidery, weaving, tailoring, and grocery retailing to sustain their livelihood. The featured borrower, Santibala, is a 39 years old, married and pictured with her hand raised with the other members of the group. She lives with her husband and two school-going children in a village that is around 20 kilometres from town. Her husband works in a brick field (one kilometer away from their house) as a daily wage earner to support his family. Santibala makes beautiful embroidery wraparounds and shawls to sell. \u201cIt has been more than 15 years that I have been doing embroidery work,\u201d she said. She can embroider two shawls or wraparounds per week and sells the end products in the market at the rate of 300 INR each. Embroidery fabrics are very popular among young girls and women and are worn during occasions and at work places. She does the household chores and when she has free time, she does embroidery work at home. The income she gets from the embroidery work is used for paying monthly school fees for the children and for buying the necessary articles for the household. She now aspires to sell embroidery fabrics with higher costs ranging from 500 INR to 800 INR to increase her income. With the Kiva loan, she will buy better quality beads, threads and fabrics for her embroidery to sell the products at a higher price. She wishes to save some of the profit she makes for school admission fees for the new session for her children and the coming festive season. She is excited to take the loan and give her thanks to the lenders for their beneficent support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1722252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy different shapes of beads, colourful threads and fabric for the embroidery that she sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-11-01T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-01T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shantibala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruhini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunibala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deviya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-05T12:03:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":786064,"name":"Maria Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria de 39 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la venta de productos pl\u00e1sticos, ollas, sartenes de aluminio, etc. asi como los que muestra en la fotograf\u00eda, su negocio est\u00e1 ubicado en el mercado municipal desde hace varios a\u00f1os, vive en casa propia con su esposo y sus tres hijos, ella esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de mas productos por mayor para poder continuar con sus ventas y as\u00ed tener mejores ingresos.","en":"Mar\u00eda, 39, sells plastic products, pots, aluminum frying pans, and similar items such as those seen in the photograph.

He is a hardworking man and aggressive with the principle of truth on his lips; he is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. Kapsowar area constitutes wrenching statistics of people living in hardcore poverty but beyond the numbers you will see bright, vibrant and open faces searching and yearning for the opportunity to live a life of dignity and respect. They have the conviction that it\u2019s possible.  \r\n\r\nArmed with this conviction, John has kept hope and has been toiling on his farm for the past 7 years. His primary sources of income have been milk, poultry and some \u201cside hustles\u201d he does to supplement the meager income he earns from farming. John is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. Juhudi Kilimo serves poor smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to the farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like dairy cows, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. \\\r\n\r\nThrough this loan from Kiva lenders John will buy not just an ordinary cow but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan, and will also go towards the education of his children. He will also benefit from the cow manure which will be used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan he will also be able to build a bio-gas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. This loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions. John waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":720.39,"image":{"id":1722300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-01T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-01T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6262.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6445.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.48,"local_amount":11054.21,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":11229.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194520},{"amount":120.08,"local_amount":10578.39,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10746.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262339},{"amount":125.72,"local_amount":11075.39,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11251.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600650},{"amount":130.46,"local_amount":11862,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":12050.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.19,"payment_id":681377503},{"amount":43.68,"local_amount":4119.05,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4184.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.08,"payment_id":711505510},{"amount":159.94,"local_amount":14774.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":15008.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.76,"payment_id":731022343}],"funded_date":"2014-11-30T03:48:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":789642,"name":"Mahina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahina is a young and successful girl.

Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Alfred access to a loan facility that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Alfred\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.

Before she became a Babban Gona member, she would have had to sell her maize for low prices soon after harvest to meet immediate needs such as food and clothing. With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, she can now store her maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40 percent more than the market price at harvest. This allows Mary to generate earnings of up to $1,000\/hectare, more than four times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.

She has a clean credit history, she hasn't even had any consultations carried out.\r\nIt is a small-scale occupation, and the income generated from the business is intended for reinvestment, which is her priority. Later, some costs of the business will be covered. \r\nShe started her business with her own capital, and she shouldered the costs of her first manicurist course, then she purchased her first nail polishes. Currently, she has a register of established clients; however, at the moment she needs to invest in her working capital, and acquire the funds to improve the quality of her services and to increase her revenues.\r\nYuliana and her family have outfitted one of the rooms of their house for the nail salon, which offers nail painting services, the application of acrylic, gelatin, resin, and encapsulated nails, as well as other techniques such as 3D, nail extensions, upkeep, and others. Her aspirations are to continue preparing herself in a beauty centre to deepen her knowledge and services in the area of esthetics."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":512.71,"image":{"id":1717853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

from poverty and malnutrition. Most of the people make their livelihood by working as labourers in the agricultural fields belonging to farmers in neighboring and more distant villages. \r\n\r\nRobert has been practicing farming on a small inherited piece of land for the past six years. To afford a decent and comfortable life for parents and siblings, he has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from his farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, he has been engaging in other small personal businesses. \r\n\r\nThe Kapsowar area has high demand for poultry products. Like many farmers from his region, Robert finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and he stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d His biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. He lacks funds to increase his poultry farming, so he is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing from a marginalized community, he finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, he feels relieved knowing that his dream will be achieved, and he will be able to buy more poultry. With the loan, he will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to his neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary man, he intends to accumulate more profits and expand his poultry business to other markets. This will increase his income and improve his living conditions. The extra income he will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan, permanently changing his living conditions, and securing the future of his school-going siblings who depend on him for school fees."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1722349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-01T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-01T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.23,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.36,"local_amount":10487.7,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10950.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262341},{"amount":83.25,"local_amount":7364.5,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7689.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.67,"payment_id":681377505},{"amount":135.16,"local_amount":12147.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12683.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.56,"payment_id":731022344}],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T01:54:25Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":789690,"name":"Alamjan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alamjan is a 48-year-old woman.
