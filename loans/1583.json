He also practices tea leaf farming and does other small activities in order to supplement the meager income he earns. \r\n\r\nBack in 2000, Erick practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was raising a maize crop of only half an acre per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for his survival. He kept up with maize farming for years without turning a profit, until 2012 when he switched to tomato farming, and then there was light at the end of the tunnel for Erick. \r\n\r\nToday, Erick is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs, and exposure visits. \r\n\r\nTo capitalize more on his returns from the booming tomato farming, Erick is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES in order to build a greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Erick conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. \r\n\r\nYour lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Erick's goal, which is to expand the greenhouse.

years old, a widow, and the mother of four. Holiskhon has received secondary education. She is retired. As a supplementary source of income for her family, Holiskhon has been growing farm produce for some 20 years. Thanks to Holiskhon's persistence and hard work, her farm at present includes a land plot of 0.63 ha [1.5 acres], where she grows potatoes, cabbage and corn to sell to wholesale buyers. Her vegetables, organically grown and very tasty, are in high demand. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, she has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 130,000 KGS to buy seeds.

The predominant type of dairy farming, traditional subsistence farming, is done mainly on a small scale for survival. Samwel has kept dairy animals for 15 years on his farm in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nSince Samwel had children, his personal and financial obligations have skyrocketed. He has different ways to make money, but keeps coming up short. He decided the best way to grow economically was to improve his farm's productivity. To increase milk production, he could either buy more cows or replace the existing cows with more productive breeds. The latter makes more economic sense. Traditional breeds are well-adjusted to the environmental conditions and disease-resistant, but their milk production is very low. Cross-breeds and Friesians are more productive, and can survive in the same environment as the traditional breeds, but they come at a price. \r\n\r\nSamwel is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase a productive dairy cow that will bring him more income. He will use the additional income to pay for his children's education and to meet family expenses. His future plan is to keep growing his income-generating asset

To be able to cover those needs, Nara is engaged in breeding livestock (a cow, calves, hens, and a pig),  and in the cultivation of wheat and fruit trees. She sells the agricultural products in the local market, which is a very important source of the family's income.  \r\n\r\nNara currently needs to make some investments in her agribusiness in order for it to function in a sustained way. She needs a loan of USD 1500 to purchase a cow. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during recent times, Nara was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nSo she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Nara  relies on the good will of the lenders and will be thankful to them for helping the family to maintain their

She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal, household needs.\r\n\r\nDivina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also has a tricycle unit for transport service, which her husband drives for added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 500 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as canned goods, sugar, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. Part of the loan will be used to repair her tricycle unit. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are her source to meet the daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nDivina hopes to maintain and grow her business so she can have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1722449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Being still young and full of energy, he has been practicing farming for the past five years, and has been making profits. His farming involves feeding and attending to his animals. His primary source of income is selling eggs, maize, vegetables and some small business he does to make ends meet. When asked what\u2019s the most enjoyable bit about farming he answered, \u201cI get food to eat and to sell\u201d. Evans has extensive land and has planted enough Napier grass. He has always wanted to buy a good dairy breed of cow, but the challenge he has been facing is a lack of finances. That is why he is seeking funds to make his dream a reality. Through Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, he will make his dream a reality because these institutions are all about helping small-scale farmers better their livelihood. He underwent training with Juhudi Kilimo and has learned that microfinance helps the poor access financing and helps them in their projects. He says that through the loan, he will increase his milk production and therefore increase his income level. Profits from the loan will be used to repay the loan and secure the future of his young

Sovetkan has a high-school education and for more than 20 years she has been growing crops and raising livestock.  Thanks to her hard and persistent work, she currently owns 1.11 hectares of land and rents 2 additional hectares.  She uses that land to grown wheat, rye, and saffron for use at her farm and for sale.  Also, she has two milk cows, two calves, two steers, 18 sheep and one horse. Everyday, Sovetkan is able to sell delicious and organic milk.  Her monthly income is 17,000 som (KGS).  To further grow her enterprise, Sovetkan turned to the bank of Bai Tushum for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to purchase steers for fattening and resale.

She and her husband work hard to meet their everyday needs and to support her children's schooling. \r\n\r\nCorazon operates a tricycle. She sells rice and charcoal as well. Her  husband drives the tricycle that carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Palawan, a tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes, and to other destinations within their community. They even transport from one town to the other. She earns a minimum of Php 1,500 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 25,000 loan, which she will use for repairs and maintenance of her tricycle, and to buy rice and charcoal to sell. She is positive that this will boost her income, as tricycle transportation, and rice and charcoal are necessities.\r\n\r\nCorazon plans to buy another tricycle unit to improve her income. She prays that her children will lead a godly and better life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and were she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Joseph is 37 years of age and one of the most hardworking men in his village of Kapsumai, in the area of Kapsowar in Kenya. He has a wife and four children and wanted to lay a good foundation for his family and grandchildren to come. That is why he started farming and has been practicing mixed farming for the past six years. \r\n\r\nHis primary sources of income have been eggs, crops, and some personal business that he does so as to accumulate more wealth. Joseph is very passionate about dairy farming and, as he always says, \u201cdairy farming is close to my heart.\u201d He has nicknamed his dairy cow \u201cChelenge.\u201d (Blemish). \r\n\r\nDairy farming in Kenya has seen an upsurge in growth, and milk prices in the recent past have skyrocketed. This has translated to increased earnings for farmers. Joseph, being a very hardworking and visionary farmer, will want to take advantage of the ready market; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to buy a good-quality breed of dairy cow. \r\n\r\nJoseph has already decided what type of dairy breed he requires and, because of his immense knowledge on preparing hay, his cows will have plenty of food and will produce more milk. Joseph projects that the cow he acquires through the loan will be producing more than 10 liters a day. Because there is a ready market for milk, he does not worry too much about competition and marketing the milk will not be a challenge. He will be selling it directly to the market as well as to big dairy-processing firms, which will result in increased earnings. Additionally, Joseph has planned that instead of selling the milk in its raw form, he will be packaging the milk, and this will also improve his income. \r\n\r\nProfits from selling milk will enable Joseph to be very successful. He also plans that through accumulated profits, he will be able to construct a bio gas digester to produce energy that he will use in cooking and other domestic chores."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1722507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-02T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-02T13:40:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.57,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3000.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3088.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3178.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3271.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3465.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3671.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3778.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3888.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4002.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4119.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":7160.02,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7178.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194527},{"amount":40.03,"local_amount":3573.1,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3582.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823878},{"amount":39.44,"local_amount":3520.29,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3529.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262346},{"amount":41.5,"local_amount":3704.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3714.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264450},{"amount":44.33,"local_amount":3957.12,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3967.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600657},{"amount":44.15,"local_amount":3941.24,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3951.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459132},{"amount":37.47,"local_amount":3452.06,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3461.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.2,"payment_id":681377512},{"amount":45.61,"local_amount":4230.16,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4241.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.78,"payment_id":696587239},{"amount":94.69,"local_amount":8861.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8884.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.59,"payment_id":731022350}],"funded_date":"2014-11-30T23:22:13Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":789786,"name":"Marilou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilou is 47 years old and married.

in the highlands of Guaemala. It is located at the base of the volcano of the same name. San Pedro is among the most visited towns on the Lake and many come here to study Spanish or simply to socialize with other travelers. The population, called \u201cPedranos\u201d are mainly Mayan Tzutujil and hold fast to their centuries old traditions and culture. \r\n\r\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cXejuyu\u201d meaning \u201cUnder the Grand Mountain\u201d was formed by seven women of the town who are motivated to improve their own lives and those of their families. \r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n is a member of the Trust Bank with nine children, some of whom are adults. Two of her younger children are about to graduate at the end of the year and she is quite pleased about this. This 55-year-old motivated woman has a coffee business as well as a textile business. She began her coffee business selling ground coffee, several years ago in order to pay for the basic expenses of her large family.  Concepci\u00f3n is also a talented seamstress and sews the beautiful blouses of San Pedro. She is requesting her second loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase coffee sacks for her successful coffee business, as well as a variety of supplies including thread and fabric for her textile business. At this time of the year, her textile business is expanding and she wants to be sure to have plenty of supplies on hand.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n and her friends in the Trust Bank are learning to find their voice and gather important life skills through the educational component of their monthly meetings. They learn about topics that affect their daily lives from a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. Taught in their own indigenous language using drawings, games and role playing, the women learn about their rights as women. They learn to use their loans wisely with new information about effective business management practices including budgeting, marketing, customer service and accounting. The ladies also gather information about health, hygiene, nutrition and the use of medicinal plants. Friendship Bridge calls the effective combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":1721457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is 43-year-old Ibrahim. He is married and has four children aged 20, 16, 14 and 10 years. In 2003, Ibrahim established his powdered milk business. He began his business in order to enable him to settle his domestic problem. His business is located at the city centre and his main customers are women. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 1,500,000 SLL every month from this business.

based in Kapsumai, a rural village in Kapsowar. He has one lovely angel-looking boy. Philemon has been practicing farming for the past six years and has never looked back. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. \r\n\r\nMost of the small holder farmers in Kapsumai village own approximately half an acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Philemon has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. Kapsumai village is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition; this has hampered Philemon from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Philemon sells vegetables, milk and tomatoes which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price. Philemon is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely way so he can overcome the challenge of facing losses. Through the loan he will deliver the products timely to the market and this means he will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. Philemon plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan fully and invest in a solid foundation for his family to come."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1722910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to deliver his products to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-02T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-02T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philemon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":786682,"name":"Blanca Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca, administra un negocio el cual consiste en atender una tienda y elaborar venta de tamales, el cual fue fundado hace 12 a\u00f1os, trabaja todos los d\u00edas, la venta de tamales la realiza todas tardes; viven con su esposo de 43 a\u00f1os de edad y sus hijos, todos trabajan juntos y subsisten con los ingresos que genera el negocio.\nInvertir\u00e1 en elote, granos b\u00e1sicos, aceite, gallinas indias, bebidas, golosinas, etc., tendr\u00e1 un mejor inventario para atraer nuevos clientes, tener una mejor rentabilidad y cumplir con sus compromisos.\nSus proyectos son tener una casa propia para que sus hijos tengan un mejor entorno.\n","en":"Blanca runs a business which is a store.

So far, he has been involved in this career for around twenty years. The average income that he is able to make is USD 2.00 per day. \r\n\r\nBecause the earning that he can generate from farming is very little, he has now come up with a business idea. He wants to open a grocery store to serve people in his community. Therefore, Douen would like to apply for a KIVA loan and he will use this loan as a capital investment to open a grocery store. With the support from this loan, he hopes that he can get more income and improve his standard of living. He would like to thank all lenders for their financial support towards poor people. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":504,"image":{"id":1722827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to open a grocery store.

Evans enjoys poultry farming and dairy farming above all other activities. The main challenges he faces with this type of farming are disease outbreaks and expensive dairy feed.\r\n\r\nEvans is asking for a loan to buy a quality breed of sheep. To him, raising sheep is an enjoyable and lucrative farming experience. He understands the challenges that come with sheep farming and the market uncertainties. This knowledge has influenced his strategic plans to incorporate a few measures beforehand. Sheep farming is very profitable and Evans will benefit from sheep wool which fetches high prices in the local and international markets. \r\n\r\nHe plans to use the income from this investment to repay the loan and to pay for his child's education.

Kenya. Like many smallholder farmers in Kenya, he owns a tiny inherited plot of land to live off of, just under half an acre, and has always struggled to support his family. His primary source of income has been crops and some small personal business he engages in to supplement his meager income. \r\n\r\nLeonard passionately loves sheep farming, but one challenge he has been facing is a lack of funds to buy a sheep. He is kindly seeking a loan to buy a superior breed of sheep. From the loan, he will get sheep wool, which fetches high prices in both the local and international market. He will also get sheep meat that he will sell to his neighbors and to the local market. \r\n\r\nFeeding the sheep will never be a challenge for Leonard because he has planted forage on his farm and will be supplementing this by cutting plants at the river bank for fodder. This will assure him of increased wool production.\r\n\r\nThis loan is going to impact the life of Leonard positively. Leonard is already thinking ahead, and with the loan, he plans to increase his wool production and sell to the international market. Other than wool from the sheep, he will benefit from the manure, which will improve his farm fertility and result in high productivity. All that Leonard waits for is for your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1722969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He works making artisanal cheese. \r\nHe is enterprising, steady, responsible, and hardworking. He works in the community of Batallas, 60km from the city, which is close to the sacred lake Titicaca and which has a very cold climate but where the suns rays strike the earth with great force. \r\nFrancisco has a dark complexion, is of medium hight, and has black and gray hair. His mother tongue is Aymara and he speaks Spanish for work. He lives his life with his wife who is a farmer. They live together in an adobe house that has electricity and water. Together, they make artisanal cheese and dairy products. Their place is tranquil. The scent of cheese is in every corner of their house. The process he follows is: he begins by testing the cheese so that he knows how it will perform. After testing the milk, he begins the transformation by cooking it at a temperature of 70 degrees for about 30 minutes. Then, he leaves it to cool and adds rennet and salt. \"Once it's at the right temperature, the whey is removed and it is drained for a time until it is completely dry\", he explains. Later, the curd is put into molds. Here the cheese takes form and later he decides in what quantity to sell it, either in 150g, 300g, 500g, or 1kg. \"Later, we refrigerate it. For this, it must be at a temperature between 1 and 4 degrees centigrade\", he explains. \r\nThis is his first loan from the institution and he has 25 years of experience in this trade.

from an agricultural institute, but he is an accomplished farmer from the Kericho area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. He is a family man, and he has two lovely children, whom he really loves and cherishes.\r\n\r\nHillary and his wife work as a team, supporting each other, and have practiced mixed farming for the past five years. Hillary often says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of the liking that he has for farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cKamwana,\u201d which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. From his dairy cow, he is able to get between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day, and this helps him support his family.\r\n\r\nHillary also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming inputs; that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; and therefore, using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels.\r\n\r\nHillary is very visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year.

He is a hardworking man who works 7 hours a day and 6 days a week. \r\n\r\nHe started his business in the year 1999 in a rural setting, and has seen it grow from one level to another through his hard work. The business is carried from Nyakabingo, Kakanju. \r\n\r\nHis customers are factories and coffee traders in western Uganda, and their continued support and his tireless efforts have helped his business to grow. He started this very business to be able to have a source of income to care for his family's needs.  \r\n\r\nWilson's major challenges in the business are limited capital and competition from other coffee traders, but he is ready to grow through his hard work. He hopes that the prices may stabilize well in the future and that he can grow his business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1723019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy coffee for trade.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2014-11-02T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-02T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":790129,"name":"Maricel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricel, 31, is married with three children and two of her children are in school.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain underserved by financial institutions. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers. \r\n\r\nMeet Justus, an ever-smiling, hardworking and honest father who is 39 years of age. He hails from the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. He is the proud father of 4 lovely, school-going children. He loves and treasures his children and will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. His primary source of income has come from selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming. Through these ventures he has been able to earn a decent income. \r\n\r\nHe is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for 10 years, and throughout he has never regretted going into farming. Although this humble dad has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses\". He faces financial challenges, and because the Nandi Hills area has proven a ready market for cereals, he is kindly seeking a loan to buy cereal for re-sale and thus improve his income. \r\n\r\nJustus' upbringing was challenging, and he has faced many economic problems. Still, this ever-smiling dad has been making great improvements, and he believes that through your loan he will be able to realize his goal of improving his living conditions and transforming his life. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, Justus has received training and proven to be honest and disciplined with finances. He intends to fully repay the loan with the profits from his business. Justus is quite visionary and - with his accumulated profits - hopes he will be able to open a large cereal selling shop that will boost his income and completely turn his life around.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1723029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals for re-sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-02T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-02T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.86,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.4,"local_amount":8122.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8343.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194531},{"amount":41.55,"local_amount":3612.93,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823885},{"amount":45.93,"local_amount":3993.54,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4102.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262351},{"amount":45.98,"local_amount":3998.41,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4107.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264454},{"amount":48.34,"local_amount":4203.75,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4318.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600662},{"amount":289.94,"local_amount":26069.3,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26780.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.86,"payment_id":681377516}],"funded_date":"2014-12-02T16:03:42Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":786706,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":408.2,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes to sell.

She is a very brave woman who has had to take charge of her three children because her husband passed away a while ago. She has had to work in various jobs, as a domestic worker, as a merchant. But, as she says, thanks to God, she has been able to make ends meet. Her children aren't studying at this moment in time because they prefer to work in the fields so they can contribute, though it may be only a little, for the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe has worked in different jobs, but she has now decided to start a new business that will take better advantage of her talents in the kitchen. She'll have a pupusa [thick corn tortilla with various fillings] business, located in her mother's house. She sees in this opportunity what she needs for her children to return to school.\r\n\r\nPedrina plans to invest in the purchase of the main ingredients to start her pupusa business, which are beans, corn, and pork, among other things. There are a few things that she already owns, such as the kitchen where she'll make the pupusas, also chairs, and tables.

As a young boy, he watched women in his village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led him to join the Marindi self-help group. For the past eight years, he has bred more than two dairy cows, developed his farm, and planted and sold a variety of crops. He says the secret to his success is thinking of farming as a way to make money, not just as a traditional way of life \u2013 adopting new technologies and methods, crop diversification, record-keeping and good planning also helps. Dominic was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that his family faced. However, he never gave up and he has been practicing farming. Dominic always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming; it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much he likes farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cBoxy\u201d, which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. Through his dairy cow, he is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps him support his family. Dominic also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, he will be able to buy high quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. Dominic is a visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through the lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Dominic believes that through the loan, he will turn around his family life and be able to give his children a solid educational background. This loan will be Dominic\u2019s way out of

62 years old, married, and the \"mother-heroine\" of nine children [\"mother-heroine\" is an honorary title awarded for bearing and raising a large family].  All her children are now adults and all, except her youngest son, have left the home to live independently.  Bubu already has 24 grandchildren.  She started her own animal husbandry in 1991 in order to provide a source of income for her family.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns four cows, ten sheep and six goats.  She prepares the hay and animal feed by herself.  She makes close to 3,000 som (KGS) per month from her animal husbandry business.  This is definitely a very small income, which is not enough to provide a decent living.  Realizing that she could make more money while still raising livestock, Bubu has decided to turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy livestock.  She is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further expanding her farming business, which will in turn enable her to increase her family's income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1722119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

In his own youth, Qurbonali had the opportunity to attend an institution of higher education and to graduate from university, which is why he can now work in his own special field.  He now wants his daughter to receive an education, so that she can also find a good job and build a career.  However, the family's tight financial situation makes it difficult for his daughter to pursue her studies.  Qurbonali doesn't have the money necessary to pay for his daughter's tuition.  He is taking a loan to pay her yearly tuition fees, so that she can continue to study.  He thanks you in advance for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1722110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his daughter's yearly tuition fees, so that she can pursue her studies.

","en":"Oyjamol is the caring mother of 4 children, and is always striving for the good of her children.  Her husband is a chauffeur, but his income is not sufficient to secure all of the necessities for the children.  For this reason, Oyjamol decided to start her own business sewing and selling women's clothes.  She studied the local market and concluded that, because demand at the local market is high, her business will grow.  She began sewing women's clothing when she was still in her youth.  She participated in and received a certificate for the course \"Bring it On\", which was organized by the Association of Business Women.  She is asking for a loan of 2,400 TJS to purchase a sewing machine.  She awaits your kindness and is counting on your charity.
