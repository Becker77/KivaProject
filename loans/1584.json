Five years ago she took charge completely as her mother was very weary. The business is selling breakfasts in the morning, desserts at lunch time, and tea in the middle of the afternoon. At 8 am she goes round to all the sellers in the area and leaves them a cup of tea or coffee with bread and a slice of cheese. Then at approximately 11am she follows the same route to pick up her dishes. Later after lunch she goes to the same places selling desserts like jello, chantilly cream, and soft drinks. Then at 6 pm she does the same as in the morning,\r\n\r\nMarina follows this schedule every day of the week as work never stops in this part of town. It means that her business is profitable and successful. Her stall is located in a difficult to access corner inside the market. It has no roof.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan since she took over the business from her mother. Marina's dream is to improve her stall or perhaps even change it either by buying another one or exchanging it.

shelter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1718616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"As I was growing up, I used to carve some in school, but little did I know that I would one day become a woodcarver. I moved to Accra to live with my dad. At the time, my father was into carving and had been asking to me to join him in his workshop, but I wasn't interested. I once visited him at work and he asked me to help with some masks. To his surprise, I finished earlier than his apprentice and did a good job. My dad sold the masks and gave me a commission. That convinced me. I quit my job as a gardener and started assisting my father. Eventually, I went to a master carver to learn how to carve other items and also to improve on my skills. In my designs I look out for accuracy and good imagination and creativity. I get inspiration from my environment and the people around me. My hope and plans for the future include establishing a workshop in my hometown and starting a tree farm and a fish farm to help the youth there have a source of income.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so thankful to you all for your assistance through this microcredit.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Sinclair's hand-carved African wood masks and sculptures on the NOVICA site:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8792\">http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8792<\/a>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1723406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase materials for his workshop, including wood, sand paper, stains, and polish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Accra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.55 -0.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T10:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T10:00:14Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sinclair","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18,"local_amount":18,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-31T10:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595290458},{"amount":18,"local_amount":18,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610681810},{"amount":27,"local_amount":27,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636433566},{"amount":49,"local_amount":49,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649702170},{"amount":24,"local_amount":24,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665191256},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681497862},{"amount":28,"local_amount":28,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696704520}],"funded_date":"2014-11-03T13:18:52Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T16:14:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Kuperberg","image":null}},{"id":790396,"name":"Marilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilia is an artisan from Brazil who specializes in leather jewelry.

Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 3,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nJosephine hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a better life. She strives to hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1723856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband is Jose and they have children. She has been operating her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store for more almost seven years, and she profits well from this. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php1500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Belen would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 50,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nBelen desires to become a successful businesswoman through all her hard work. She dreams for her family to be always happy and healthy. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells school supplies. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 1500 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a Php 42,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings is their source to meet their daily expense and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they can have a better life. She strives to hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life.

A tear comes to the eye knowing what happened.  The thing that impacts you the most is how this woman, who has a giant heart, reacted and continues struggling to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a displaced woman because of violence.  She has 7 children, ages 10, 14, 18, 20, 24, 28, and 13.  Her 14 year old son (see photo) suffers from a terminal intestinal disease.  He has struggled for five years with this disease, which has kept Carmen from working and struggling for a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story does not end here.  Her oldest daughter went to Ecuador and left her ten year old son.  Ever since her daughter went away, her son grew up calling Carmen mother.  She adopted her 13 year old son from a companion because he was going to be left on the street.  She welcomed him into her loving heart.\r\n\r\nThis woman, in spite of her problems and her financial situation, does not give up.  She wants to request a loan to start her business of selling fast foot at her house.  She is looking to improve her quality of life.  She does not like going from house to house asking or begging for money in order to live.  She wants to work and struggle to get ahead with her family.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan will be to buy a food cart (see photo), supplies, tools, and raw material to make soft drinks, bread, meat, and salads, etc.  Carmen asks that you help her by supporting her project.  She wants her children to live well and not be in need.  She wants them to go to school because poverty is not an excuse to give up.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":801.73,"image":{"id":1719381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to start a business of selling fast food.

Married to Leonilo, a fish vendor, and has three children, one is in high school, one in the elementary level, and the other one not of school age yet. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs, and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nMelody has operated a general store for five years already. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells fish.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum net income of Php 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda, and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings is their source to meet their daily expenses, and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nMelody hopes to maintain and grow her business so they could have a better life. She strives to hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1723953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Even with savannah plains and little human activity, there exists a farm that stands tall, a farm with more than three high-pedigreed Friesian cows, producing over 30 litres of milk. It\u2019s quite an outstanding feat, considering the harsh terrain and other handicaps, like the lack of electricity from the national grid and dependence on traditional methods of harvesting water.\r\n\r\nMeet Denis, the man credited with the success story of this farm. He is a loving husband and has been farming for the past four years. Denis passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that he knows his cows, each individually, because he works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. He and his wife have even named one of them \u201cToleltol\u201d meaning the brown one. Because he loves the cows, he runs his operation by four simple rules that have kept him and his herd happy. The rules are: breed them well, feed them well, clean them well and milk them well. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that he engages in to make ends meet. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses, but he is hopeful that he will improve. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. Juhudi Kilimo serves poor smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to the farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like dairy cows, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. Through this loan from Kiva lenders Denis will buy not just an ordinary cow but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan, and will help with the education of his child. He will benefit from the cow manure which will be used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan he will also be able to build a bio-gas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. This loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions. Denis waits for your kindness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1723925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T14:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T14:50:14Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4325.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4452.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4582.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4716.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4854.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4995.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5141.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5292.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5446.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5606.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5769.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5938.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6112.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6290.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6474.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Henry Goodman","image":null}},{"id":790791,"name":"Dickson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a father to 2 children, the great desire to see them all grow up to be professionals is what fills Dickson with enthusiasm and inspiration. Dickson is 25 years old and works tirelessly to raise animals. Through these humble tasks, he aspires to offer all of his children a university education. Dickson learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to his parents. He has a tiny plot of land to live off \u2013 just under half an acre \u2013 and has always struggled to support his family. \r\n\r\nDickson has developed the farm in the sloping undulating terrain by successfully adopting suitable soil and water conservation methods such as stone pitched bench terracing and digging rain water storage pits. For over five years his income source has been from selling milk, poultry, and vegetables. He supplements the meager income by doing other personal  business. Dickson passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. He is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Milk, poultry and vegetables are very perishable, and these products require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. \r\n\r\nKitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Dickson is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Farmers like Dickson will use the motorbike to transport passengers and farm goods to and from the market. They are suited for areas with poor road networks which are inaccessible by cars. They are also very cheap to acquire and maintain. \r\n\r\nInvest in Dickson\u2019s future and you won't regret it. He is full of promise.

I will do all things that contribute to the well-being of my family,\u201d said Phakhochong, 40 years old. \r\n\r\nShe is pictured with the other members of the group and featured with her hand raised. Her husband sold firewood and charcoal for sustenance of the family, which was not reliable due to the inaccessibility of vehicles in the area and lead to failure in his business. \r\n\r\nShe joined the Choi Aan group in the year 2010 with the hope of achieving financial stability and started earning money by running a tea stall in her native village, which consists of around 65 households. She makes tea and roti (pancake) to sell to customers and also sells other grocery items in the tea stall.\r\n\r\nThe tea stall has been the main source of income for the family. She supports four school-going children from the income she earns from the tea stall. The income was sufficient for their family until they had to pay the fees of a minor operation for the eldest one. Since then, they were short of finances every now and then, and she could hardly manage to buy materials needed for her tea stall. She cannot pay for the children\u2019s school fees regularly after that. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to revive her tea stall and her family's financial condition by buying more inventory for the tea stall so that she can sell more items to attract customers. With the Kiva loan, she will buy more stock of inventory to sell. She will provide school fees and the articles required for the household. \r\n\r\nShe sends good wishes to the lenders for their kind act. The rest of the group members are hardworking. They are engaged in similar business, including a grocery store, poultry, a vegetable business, livestock, weaving and a piggery, to become self-reliant."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1722378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy inventory for her tea stall to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T14:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T14:50:18Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengboilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jangneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoineilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phaljahat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimhat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phakhochong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":105000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T01:40:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":790794,"name":"Rachael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rachael is a single woman and owns a house that has piped water, but not electricity.

The income sources of Godfrey are very perishable and they require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Godfrey is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Through the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nGodfrey is very determined to succeed, and because he is much disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey\u2019s dream is to go back to school and he hopes that through your loan, you will help him realize his dream.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1723968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to deliver his fresh poultry products to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T15:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T15:00:07Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2933.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3018.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3107},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3197.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3291.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3387.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3486.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3588.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3693.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3801.14},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3912.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4026.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4144.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4265.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4390.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4518.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4650.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4786.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4926.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5070},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5218.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5370.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5527.74},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5689.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.32},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.85},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.71},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":790781,"name":"Lia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lia is a 50-year-old woman from Ambrolauri district.

The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. She will sell various kinds of harvested fruits and vegetables and will get her own customers from selling the fresh products door-to-door with the help of her son.

John has been able to provide nutritious food for his family. After his wife lost her formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family fell to John.

This challenge has not made him give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" he said. \r\n\r\nJohn is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow. The dairy cow that he plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase his business enterprise. \r\n\r\nJohn is very visionary, and he intends that in the near future, he will start adding value to his milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. He will also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure his family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, he will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.

He has a wife and child and  lives on a small piece of land. His primary source of income has been eggs, crops, and personal business. He has farmed for 5 years and has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture, particularly the Maasai tribe where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Rovin wants to take advantage of the market. His products are perishable and require timely delivery to the market. Making delivers to the market on time is difficult. The Kitale area has a poor road network and feeder roads. This hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Rovin seeks a loan to buy a motorbike.   The motorbike will help him to deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nRovin has faced financial challenges  but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Rovin chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low. Rovin received training through Juhudi Kilimo and during the training season, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits, Rovin plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees.

When she was young there was no school near the community where she lived and her family didn't have the money to send her away to study, so she had no access to education. Her husband is a farmer and together they have three children who are all in school. They all live together and only her children are dependent upon her.\r\n\r\nMaria has been making hammocks for 15  years. She learned how to do this by going to a workshop that was held in her community 15  years ago. She decided to do this work because she enjoys it and it also doesn't require much physical effort, and she can do it in her home. \r\n\r\nMaria is also a cook. She works at the local school where she is in charge of preparing meals for the school children. The school is only a two minute walk from her house.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy materials for making hammocks, including nylon, silk and ordinary yarns and also to buy fertilizer and pesticides to apply to her husband's corn field. She hopes they get a good crop of corn which the family will use for their own consumption, and then sell whatever is left over. Maria is also thinking of making other types of handicrafts so she can have more to offer her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1718776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy nylon, silk and ordinary yarns as well as fertilizer and pesticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T15:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T15:40:08Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.24,"local_amount":58.24,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":58.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545880},{"amount":25.75,"local_amount":25.75,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624834015},{"amount":11.14,"local_amount":11.14,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":11.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636202104},{"amount":34.46,"local_amount":34.46,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650537810},{"amount":127.57,"local_amount":127.57,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":127.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666803889},{"amount":42.84,"local_amount":42.84,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":42.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482719}],"funded_date":"2014-11-05T01:50:06Z","paid_date":"2015-07-26T12:14:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":790859,"name":"Anecita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anecita, 49, is a married woman with four children.

The filter is guaranteed for two years, though most find the filter works for three-five years.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1723958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to purchase a TerraClear water filter so she can have access to safe drinking water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Parksan District, Borlikhamxai Province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":393,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T16:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T16:00:12Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kheuavan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounmee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xiengnou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounmee","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sone","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounchan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonexai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"San","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounkuam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tiem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seekone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanthee","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Somlid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donechan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ting","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sao","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LAK","disbursal_amount":11270000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11270000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.41,"local_amount":1150000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1169815.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579772288},{"amount":145.41,"local_amount":1150000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-25T11:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1169815.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":597066577},{"amount":290.82,"local_amount":2300000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2339630.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611965609},{"amount":145.41,"local_amount":1150000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1169815.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637757935},{"amount":145.41,"local_amount":1150000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1169815.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649742437},{"amount":145.41,"local_amount":1150000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1169815.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665232107},{"amount":407.13,"local_amount":3220000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3275482.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":698012184}],"funded_date":"2014-11-04T16:51:59Z","paid_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":790874,"name":"Samina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samina is a 35-year-old mother of three children.

This is because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. \r\n\r\nEven though some people in the village, including Khamluen, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users since they spend less on bottled water. Khamluen and other filter users also buy less charcoal fuel used to boil water and spend less time foraging for firewood. Khamluen's filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most users find the filter works from 3-5 years. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":1723889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to purchase TerraClear water filters so they can have access to safe drinking water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Parksan District, Borlikhamxai Province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":393,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T16:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T16:00:13Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khamluen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khamsing","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khammai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Somphong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Done","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Auan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Failin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khamchan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samlerng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Som","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sounthavong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wieu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounhom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xaeng","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thongdaeng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Authai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Onpaeng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Done","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sing","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Say","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Aphixad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Khem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LAK","disbursal_amount":13720000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13720000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":352.04,"local_amount":2800000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-25T11:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2832183.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":597066583},{"amount":352.04,"local_amount":2800000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2832183.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611965615},{"amount":176.02,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1416091.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637757941},{"amount":176.02,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1416091.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649742443},{"amount":176.02,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1416091.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665232113},{"amount":492.86,"local_amount":3920000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3965057.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":698012190}],"funded_date":"2014-11-05T11:28:59Z","paid_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peggy","image":1683516}},{"id":790855,"name":"Khouloud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khouloud is a 30-year-old single lady who is the sole breadwinner for eight members of her family.
