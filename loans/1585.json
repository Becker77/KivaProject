She is aged 46 and a resident of Coron, Palawan, Philippines. She is married to Rogelio, a carpenter, and has three children. She manages her household while operating a business. She works hard, to augment their income in order to meet their daily household needs and to send her children to school. <br \/><br \/>Cecilia has been operating a variety store for five years, already. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities, directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go, to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1000 a day. <br \/><br \/>To help her grow and continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy grocery items, such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda, and other groceries. She is positive that it will boost her income, as she expands her business. Her earnings are the family's income source for meeting their daily living expenses and sending her children to school. She is thanking God and you, in advance, for the financial help that will be given her.<br \/><br \/>Cecilia hopes to maintain and grow her business, so they could have a better and comfortable life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible, and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

","en":"Anargul is 40 years old, married and raising 4 children together with her husband. Anargul has a secondary education and, to provide the primary income for her family, is involved in animal husbandry and farming. Thanks to Anargul's hard work, today her business contains 3 cows and a 1.0 hectare land plot, where she grows corn for the household consumption and sale to local residents. The monthly income amounts to about 15,000 som (KGS). Her husband and children actively help with the business. They try to invest their savings into the development and expansion of the business. However, because they just finished their house construction this year, they have a need to work on its exterior trim, and this is why Anargul requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy doors, cement, planks and other building materials.

","en":"Fatima is 48 years old, married and a mother of two children. Fatima has a secondary education and, together with her husband, has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for 18 years already. Fatima grows potatoes, cereal crops and sainfoin on her 1.0 hectares of land for the household consumption and sale. Fatima's business also contains 2 cows, a bull, 5 sheep and a horse. Fatima's business yields her a profit of 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Fatima requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock and, since the livestock headcount will increase, to build a barn for the livestock.

Nilufar desperately needed an additional source of income, so she started a new business a month ago - she sells children's clothing. Nilufar rents a market stall at the local market. Currently she sells winter clothes, such as snow suits, warm sweaters etc. She manages her business on her own. Nilufar wants to expand her inventory and is requesting a loan of 10,000 somoni to purchase more clothes and increase the variety of items she can offer.

On his days off he also goes out with his father to sell fruit, vegetables, dairy products, and seafood, which is a way for him to supplement his family's income.

households are adopting entrepreneurship measures, including Emilsen. Emilsen is 37 years old, and has had to be responsible for her two daughters who are 15 and 10 years old, and for her youngest son who is 8 years old. Looking at her situation, she saw a great idea to get ahead that was in her house, which was to implement an internet, printing and scanning service, with which she has covered her basic needs. Also, in her free time, she works at her sewing machine repairing clothing.\r\n\r\nFaced with the warm welcome from the public for her services, Emilsen wants to request a loan that she will use to purchase a CPU and a processor. This loan will allow her to assist her clients more, earning more income that will be helpful to pay her quotas and to save, to continue expanding and have more computers. Her priority is to improve the conditions of her home, and to pay for her children's education.

His father is a carpenter and his mother is a housewife. Despite their financial limitations through the years, they managed to educate their eight children, of whom five are already professionals and three are still studying.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished high school, Carlos decided to go to vocational school and study Industrial Mechanics. Later, after finishing his studies, he began to work at a welding shop and is going for a specialization in the field in which he works. That is why he decided to take training in soldering and welding processes; however, he can't cover the cost of his studies, so he has applied for an educational loan.  \r\n\r\nCarlos is grateful to the people who, with their financial resources, enable him to continue studying and achieve his dreams of becoming an excellent professional. He hopes to start his own mechanic shop and give other young men the opportunity to have a job, as well as give back to his parents for all their hard work.

It is a way to give her family food.  Her three daughters live with them.\r\n\r\nShe has worked as a domestic employee for ten years.  She provides her service in a woman\u2019s home in the area.  Because of her humility and honesty she has kept the job.  Her home is five kilometers away, and her work schedule is from seven a.m. until four p.m.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy fertilizers and compost for her corn crop.\r\n\r\nHer wish is for her family to prosper and have a better quality of life.  She wants all of her daughters to become successful professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1719563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy fertilizers and compost for her corn crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T17:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T17:50:15Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anagil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536695}],"funded_date":"2014-11-09T01:21:40Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:20:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":791006,"name":"Hatixhe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hatixhe needs your help again; she is seeking 100,000 Albanian Lek to make some more repairs to her house, seen in the background of this photo.

","en":"Altynkan is 45, widowed, and has three children.  She has the equivalent of a high school education, and has grown crops and raised livestock for the past 10 years.  She's very skilled at what she does, and has had her share of success running her business.

For now he is getting his high school diploma from the local school. He lives with his wife, who is a homemaker. They have two children who are ages seven and two. The older one goes to school and the youngest stays home with his mother.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been working as a radio host for seven years now. He decided to work in radio thanks to a friend who helped him get started. He didn't let this opportunity pass him by so he is still working while at the same time earning his degree. Classes are from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm, and then he goes to work at the radio station from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm. The station is near his home so he doesn't have to travel far: it is about a five-minute walk.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan he is requesting to buy four wooden doors and windows, because his family feels unsafe living with the current doors, which are damaged. This loan will allow him to live more safely with his family and they will all have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn the future Jos\u00e9 wants first of all to go on to college so that he can earn a degree and find a better job. He also wants to continue remodeling his home and expand it. He says he will achieve all of this by working hard and requesting other loans in the future to keep building. He also wants the best for his children, so that they become upstanding people in society. He wants them to go to school, study hard, and get a college degree. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1719539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy four wooden doors and windows for his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T18:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T18:40:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":791027,"name":"Shahbana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahbana, age 34, is a married woman.

Peter is married with 2 children and a resident of Kishanda cell, Nyakinengo, Rukungiri district.  \r\n\r\nHe didn\u2019t acquire enough education and he decided to engage himself in productive agriculture of cattle trade and poultry to be able to support his family. He later found out that the money from poultry was not enough to meet all his family's financial needs and decided to join Kishanda Tukore Namani group in order to borrow loan funds. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan was to buy more poultry birds and also buy their feed. He is optimistic they will be ready for sell during Christmas time when the demand is high, therefore increasing his income. He and the group members are grateful for the support offered by Ugafode and Kiva funders.

The nearby villages also suffer from dirty and unsafe drinking water. \r\n\r\nKhamvan is excited that he, like his group members, was able to purchase a water filter. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter; this is because the filter removes bacteria and other water borne diseases. The water filter also increases disposable income to users like Khamvan due to the decreased cost of purchasing charcoal, by decreasing time spent foraging for wood, and decreasing  the amount of money used to  purchase bottled water. The filter is guaranteed for 2 years, though most find the filter works from 3-5

She doesn't have a refrigerator for her business, though, which forces her to buy deli meats at retail prices and stock her business on a daily basis. This takes a lot of time and costs a lot in transportation. Sometimes her products even go bad because of the intense heat in the area.\r\n\r\nThis is her first sequence of loans with the institution in the three years she's been in the business. Her dream is to have her children become professionals. She will use this loan to expand her business by investing in the purchase of a cooler with a showcase so that her products stay refrigerated and can be seen by her customers.

His parents are currently working in the Russian Federation; his father is a driver for a grocery store where his mother also works as a cashier.  While studying in secondary school, Anzarbek worked as a fare collector on a bus in his free time.  At the moment, he's enrolled at a university as an economics major, and dreams of finishing school and becoming a specialist in his field.  As he comes from modest means, he lacks the money to pay for his tuition in full, and has turned to Arvand for a loan.  The money from his loan will not only go towards his tuition, but will be used for school supplies as well.  Anzarbek is happy that he has the opportunity to get a loan for his education through Arvand, and is thankful that they're able to help people with low income from rural areas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1724184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay for his university tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She and her husband are working hard to provide for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan. It will be used to buy additional supplies and merchandise, such as clothing, footwear, undergarments, and cosmetics. The more items she has on display and available on hand, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from this business will definitely help her to sustain her child\u2019s education and daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nGemma hopes that her business will continue to become successful and she dreams of going to another country someday. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Ronaldo, a taxi driver, and has four children, two of whom are in high school, one in elementary school and one already working. Olivia manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment the family's income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nOlivia has operated a variety store for five years. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Olivia earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells frozen processed foods. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Olivia earns a minimum net income of PHP 800 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Olivia is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery items. She is positive that her income will increase as she expands her business. Olivia thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nOlivia hopes to maintain and grow her business so her family can have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. Olivia faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1724780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
