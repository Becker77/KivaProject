","en":"Yrysbubu is 42 years old, a widow and a mother of three. She has a high school degree. Since 2004 the main source of income for the family has been farming, which Yrysbubu started with 10,000 som (KGS). She now owns 3 goats, as well as 1.5 acres of land where she grows corn and tobacco. Her hard work provide the family with 10,000 som (KGA) a month. This is nowhere near enough to have a decent life and raise children. But Yrysbubu does not despair and is looking for new ways to expand her business. She has now turned to \"Bai Tushum\" bank for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS), so she can purchase four cows.

He is applying for a loan, part of which he will use to buy fertilizer and other supplies for growing coffee.

He wants to make the most of the excellent land and climate here to maximize his yields and says that he has many years of experience behind him to succeed.

She did not go to school because her parents did not think that it was useful for her to study, and preferred to teach her to work so that she could help with the household expenses. She lives with her partner and is the mother of 7 children, whose ages are 20, 18, 16, 11, 9, 6, and 1. Only four of them live with her. Her partner works in agriculture, while Salvadora has worked for more than a year selling tortillas. She learned this work from her mother, who has done it all of her life, so that she can help her husband financially and pay for her children to study and to have a better quality of life. Salvadora does not travel to work, as she works from her home. She works from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm every day. The loan that she is requesting is to buy corn, lime, and enough firewood to be able to make enough tortillas for all of her customers in the community. In this way she will have more income, and be able to pay more of the bills. Salvadora's dream is to improve her tortilla business, to enable her children can study so that they can have a better future, and to repay her loan without difficulty. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1719726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy corn, lime and enough firewood to be able to make enough tortillas for all of her customers in the community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T23:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T23:30:12Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvadora Del Transito ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":30.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":60.42,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":60.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579545635},{"amount":28.69,"local_amount":28.69,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":28.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146044},{"amount":32.19,"local_amount":32.19,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":32.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769570},{"amount":33.52,"local_amount":33.52,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":33.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833198},{"amount":32.36,"local_amount":32.36,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":32.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200964},{"amount":34.12,"local_amount":34.12,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":34.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536702},{"amount":35.4,"local_amount":35.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":35.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802620},{"amount":143.3,"local_amount":143.3,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":143.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482728}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T14:13:14Z","paid_date":"2015-07-26T12:14:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorna Gladman","image":733132}},{"id":791129,"name":"Haladu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Haladu is a maize farmer from Katsalle village. \r\n\r\nBefore he became a Babban Gona member, Haladu would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest, to cater for his immediate cash needs.

He began working early and believes that it is going well for him because of the dedication he shows each day as he fights to pull himself and his family ahead. \r\n\r\nMichael is very grateful to Kiva lenders because this loan will help him to buy seasonal clothing for his business. This will help him to increase his earnings and eventually he will buy his own house so that his loved ones will be more comfortable."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1720285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy clothing to improve his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2014-11-03T23:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-03T23:40:06Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3510,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.55},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.86},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":332},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":344.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Craven","image":1668972}},{"id":791559,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is 55 years old and married with six children, one of whom is in school.

left home.  Now she lives with her husband. The source of the family's income is animal husbandry. Sudaba has been breeding cows for 38 years. She learns a lot from day to day about this area and her monthly income is 200 AZN.\r\n\r\nHusbandry has spread in Azerbaijan because people have a high demand for milk and meat. She fattens cows and then resells them for a profitable price. Additionally she makes dairy products for sale from milk. Local people buy milk from Sudaba every day because the products she sells are always fresh and tasty. \r\n\r\nShe needs money to cover her family's need to pay for her husband's medicines.

The climate here greatly favors high-altitude cash crops and dairy farming, both of which he practices. He also keeps poultry for eggs and grows vegetables for both sales and his family's consumption. However, the income Jacob makes from farming is not sufficient to sustain his large family. This has forced Jacob to look for other sources of income to supplement the meager income he earns. \r\n\r\nJacob is seeking a loan to purchase farming equipment. He spends most of his time doing \u2018general farm work', as he put it. His biggest challenge is the unfavorable tools he owns. Poor farmers in Africa usually do not have the right tools for their work. This makes work hours on the farm longer and harder. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help to improve Jacob's farm machinery, and hence indirectly protect the investment he makes in his farm. Because they are modern and new, the tools you are financing give farmers confidence in the quality, reliability and safety of the implements they employ. Your loan will help Jacob to acquire tools that improve productivity and yields, plus reduce work time and physical effort. \r\n\r\nYou will have also helped Jacob's family's health, since there are health implications from using ineffective traditional tools. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, \u201cHow will this loan benefit your family?\u201d Jacob replied, \u201cIncreased food security in my household.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1725104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farming implements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-04T01:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-04T01:00:18Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2580.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2655.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2813.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2895.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2980.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3067.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3157},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3249.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3344.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3441.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3542.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3646.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3752.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3862.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3975.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4091.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":791638,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is an ambitious man and looks to a future when he is the leading supplier of milk in his area.

Lembi is the featured borrower of the group pictured with the group members. To sustain her livelihood, she makes pretty embroidered shawls and wraparounds to sell and supply in the market. One embroidered fabric is sold at the rate of 350 INR and she makes  a little profit out of one wraparound skirt. She lives in a remote village and sends her two sons to a boarding school with the hope of better education facilities in town. In the previous years, she availed a loan from WSDS to buy an embroidery machine, which became the main income-generating source for the household. She is able to provide boarding school fees for the two sons from the income she gets from selling embroidered fabrics. Her husband was a daily wage earner and recently he has been doing poultry farming for job satisfaction, thinking it will be much more productive. Most of their income is used for buying fodder since they are at the initial stage of their poultry farming and no income is derived yet. She is short of money to buy materials needed for her embroidery, leading to a decrease in her production due to inadequate materials for production. They have been facing difficulties paying the household expenses and boarding fees of the children. She now aspires to buy more stock of embroidery materials to recover from her financial deficit. With the Kiva loan, she will buy more fabrics, beads and threads to make charming shawls and wraparounds to attract more customers. She is very happy and sends her thank you to the lenders. The other members of the group are working hard to support themselves. They are engaged in embroidery, weaving, a petty shop, tailoring and vegetable vending to generate income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1724991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy embroidery materials including fabrics, beads and threads to make pretty wraparound skirts and shawls to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-11-04T01:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-04T01:20:04Z","loan_amount":3025,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tondonbi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Indubala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shakhitombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Radhamukhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunitibala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prabha Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guneshwari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memma Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lembi Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibe Devi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":185000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":185000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-17T22:38:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":791631,"name":"Stella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stella is a hardworking woman who runs a retail shop selling general merchandise. \r\n\r\nStella also does farming to add to her income. \r\n\r\nShe would like to build a permanent house and trade wholesale only to not be affected by inadequate capital plus constant price fluctuations.

progress. However, David is a man who never gives up despite the weather or situations that happen. He always manages to meet the requirements of his family. He gets up very early in the morning to go to his farm where he works. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely 58-year-old wife. They have been blessed with three children. On the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for 30 years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business to supplement the meager income they earn. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, David is seeking a loan of 35,000 KES to grow his horticulture business. (Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector.) It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford David access to a loan facility that will help him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, David\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.

When asked, Nuhu said: \u201cI would now be able use this extra income to expand my farmland, and eventually, I hope to become the most profitable farmer in my community.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1633282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to meet urgent expenses like child school fees, food and farm loan repayments, eliminating pressure to sell corn at low prices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-04T02:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-04T02:00:07Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuhu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":15252,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":15252}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-05T14:18:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":788064,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"M\u00e3e de 3 filhos menores e todos com acesso aescola, tem 37 anos de idade, estudou ate 3\u00aa classe, vive maritalmente, \u00e9 negociante ambulante a v\u00e1rios anos, conta com ajuda do esposo trabalhador de uma empresa de seguran\u00e7a e esta a repetir o credito pela 3\u00aavez.\nVai usar o valor na compra de telem\u00f3veis de v\u00e1rios tipos e referncias, lencois e bijuterias para ampliar o seu negocio.\nO seu maior desejo \u00e9 crescer no negocio, construir uma casa melhor para sua fam\u00edlia e desenvolver tal como as outras pessoas que conseguem se dar bem na vida atravez do negocio.\nDiz ter o negocio num bom ritmo, embora algumas vezes seus clientes n\u00e3o tem honrado com o compromisso, mas mesmo assim se sente feliz com o mesmo\n","en":"Isabel is the mother of three underage children, all of whom attend school.

Eldoret area of Kenya. This charming father of seven lovely angels has been engaged in mixed farming for the past 15 years. He commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in his village. His main source of income has been eggs, milk, and a variety of food crops that he plants. Taking care of his poultry is an activity he finds very enjoyable. Feeding his poultry is his hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Eldoret. \r\n\r\nBenjamin has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. Being a visionary man, he has always wanted to increase his poultry. He is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for marginalized communities is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising men like Benjamin will achieve their dreams and goals. Benjamin believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, he is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, he will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve his living conditions and to repay the

she owns. She's a single mother of two daughters, one of whom is in college and the other is in high school. Both of them are under her responsibility. She tried to be a homemaker, but she had no luck and the marriage fell apart. She has worked as a secretary for a long time. However, since she has been having a difficult time providing food and education for her daughters because of the low salary she earns monthly, she felt compelled to start a business. She saved a few months' salary and started a business making bricks for construction. One of her neighbors told her about Hluvuku and how they provided loans in the village of the district of Marracuene. She went to apply for her first loan so that she could increase turnover in her business. She currenty owns a successful business and she never lacks customers. She gets help from a few seasonal workers. She recently got a loan for 20,000mt and with this amount she will purchase formwork supplies such as planks, formwork sheets, and plumb-bobs. She will rent out these supplies. Her biggest dream is to become Hluvuku's best customer and get other loans in order to open a warehouse to sell construction supplies. That way she'll ensure her daughters' college education. Her biggest challenge is not having a means of transportation for carrying and delivering her merchandise."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":493.42,"image":{"id":1719969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

With the help of this loan amount she will financially assist her husband to get these tailoring accessories listed above to fulfill his business needs so that he can earn more profitable income.\r\n\r\nYasmeen is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for this financial assistance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1725217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

With the goal of creating her own source of income, for 28 years she moved to Puerto Cabezas to sell food and steel accessories. She has been part of a group for two years.

and lack of capital. This is true for Mercy, 24, who is based in the Eldoret area of Kenya and is a mother of five adorable lovely children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years, and she has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal businesses she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking Sirikwa (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. \r\n\r\nThe dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will produce between 10-15 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Mercy is very ambitious. In the near future she intends to start adding value to her milk business by packaging the milk before selling, and she also plans to start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to

Eldoret area of Kenya. Pamela, aged 29, and the mother of three boys and one girl, has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary source of income has been selling eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. \r\n\r\nPamela, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early-riser and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nPamela is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. Through the loan she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a Kiva field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to repay the loan fully and to improve her living

He makes a living growing crops and raising dairy animals for commercial end. He carries out these activities on a small farm that he has been running for over 6 years. He has only one child with his lovely wife Lilian. \r\nThe village Hillary hails from is situated in an extremely remote location called Moiben. Here, animal-powered transportation is very common. Although this may seem primitive in comparison to modern transportation, animals in the area allow great advancements through facilitation of trade. \r\nHillary is seeking a loan to purchase a motorcycle. He already owns one but he is planning to buy more to fulfill the demand for a modern form of transportation. Frequently, trips between 0 and 5 kilometers in rural communities are undertaken for farming purposes and domestic needs. The animal-drawn transport equipment available are limited and have design deficiencies which limit efficient usage.\r\nWith your loan, Hillary will purchase an Indian motorcycle that will be used to ferry passengers and goods within and beyond the village. They are faster, cheaper, easier to maintain and more economic on fuel. Besides, ownership of animals with their transport devices are only attractive when animals are also engaged in other activities.\r\nThis loan will benefit Hillary's family by reducing the high costs they spend on transportation every month. Returns from the investment will go to his child's education and family welfare."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1725079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a motorcycle for farm transportation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-04T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-04T04:30:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bethany Katerberg","image":604977}},{"id":791759,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina works hard to support her family.

She has been doing this for ten years from her home, which is why there is great demand for her products and her clients order more of her products every day. She has lived with her partner and their four children, aged 17, 14, 12, and 1, for five years. Ana knows that the peak season for selling chickens and hens is near, which is why this enterprising woman wishes to invest in her business in order to buy a greater quantity of chickens and hens. In this way she will have enough to meet the demand for chickens and hens in the peak sales period, but Ana does not have the necessary funds, which is why she is requesting a loan from FUSAI to invest in buying hens and broiler chickens.

The strength that Beatriz has is making quilts, pillowcases, pillows, potholders, towel for bathrooms, tablecloths and keychains.\r\n\r\nThey are original designs and with very good finishes which is why she has a portfolio of repeat customers. She started business five years ago, but officially began offering her products for three years. She sells to schools especially at Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.  She also offers her wares via a friend to the inmates of the prison.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to buy a machine that will allow a faster and more professional finish and purchase of raw material for making Christmas orders, which is considered high season. Beatriz lives in an area where adequate sources of employment do not exist.  Many of the women in the area decided to start their own productive activity that allows them to contribute to the household or your children's education. Her dream is to enlarge her workshop, have more machines and employ women in the area."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":653.17,"image":{"id":1711054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking
