near the Great Rift Valley. He owns a small piece of land together with his lovely 41-year-old wife, and they have been blessed with four children. \r\n\r\nOn the land, they have kept dairy cattle and grown vegetables for five years. Their main income sources are milk and crops. They recently ventured into a small personal business to supplement the meager income they earn through farming. \r\n\r\nFrom Kiva lenders, Richard is seeking a loan worth 65,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to grow his horticulture business. \r\n\r\nHorticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford Richard access to a loan facility that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Richards\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1725318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand his horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-04T05:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-04T05:30:07Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":791796,"name":"Wumpini  Pishigu No.2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fuseina is a 46-year-old woman from Pishigu No.2 in the Northern region of Ghana.

He owns a 15-acre piece of land that is home to his family. With the support of his wife of 6 years, Geoffrey does mixed farming. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs, and tea produced at the farm enables him to provide a decent living for his family of 4 children. He also uses the income from farming to pay for his children's education.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey is seeking a loan to purchase a dairy cow to add to the three cows he already owns. Dairy farming is a good, sustainable source of income for farmers like Geoffrey. As time goes by, children grow, and family expenses also soar.

He is a super incredible farmer! He certainly ranks among the top successful smallholder farmers on Juhudi Kilimo's client list. Born in 1980 into a humble family, Nelson's upbringing was difficult. He never finished high school because of mounting school fees in arrears, but he never gave up in life. He started practicing mixed farming and married a lovely wife who is 26 years old today. Together, they were blessed with 3 children.\r\n\r\nNelson practices farming on a 1-acre farm that is owned by the family in the village of Cheplanget. On the farm, he grows passion fruit, beans, millet, vegetables, soybeans, and maize. He also keeps more than two highly productive dairy cows for milk production. The 34-year-old farmer sells his produce in bulk 5 kilometers away from his home. His key clients are the Cereal Board, institutions, and local people. He is such a good farmer that the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture picked his farm to be a model farm for other farmers. He is also the chairman of Cheplanget Group, a group he formed to help members, who are smallholder farmers, save money and use their savings to access loans from financial institutions.\r\n\r\nNelson is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to build a greenhouse. He needs greenhouse technology to continuously improve the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of his major farming systems. A greenhouse will provide a favorable environment for his plants and protect them from adverse climate conditions such as wind, cold, precipitation, excessive radiation, extreme temperature, insects, and diseases. With your assistance, Nelson will have year-round production of crops and off-season production of vegetable and fruits. He will also save on the use of natural resources such as water. With greenhouse technology, the water requirements of crops are very limited and easy to control.\r\n\r\nNelson has a great credit history. In 2010, he took a loan of 100,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) and successfully serviced it. He stated that this loan will change his life. Profits from this investment will be plowed back into the business to fuel further growth. There still remains so much space on his land for future growth. If ever there was an opportunity to invest a $25 loan in someone's future, this is it! You won't regret it!"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1725353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-04T05:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-04T05:50:05Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3785.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3895.71},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4009.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4126.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4247.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4371.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4499.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4630.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4766.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4905.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5048.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5196.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5348.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5504.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5665.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Supryia Ray","image":null}},{"id":788320,"name":"Mercedes  Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en casa propia con su grupo familiar, ella es empleada de una empresa privada, con lo que gana en su trabajo logra cubrir algunos gastos de la casa, ella quiere mejorar su vivienda colocando puertas y balcones, pero no tienen de suficiente capital por esa raz\u00f3n solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar laminas, hierro, balcones, vidrios para ventanas y pago de mano de obra, para ella y su familia puedan vivir c\u00f3modos y seguros.","en":"Mercedes is 38, she lives in a house she owns with her family, she is an employee at a private company.

Her business is the sale of cosmetics. \r\n\r\nShe is resourceful, independent, tenacious, responsible, hardworking, and a good mother. She carries out her work as a traveling salesperson in the rural community of La Angostura, a site characterized by agriculture. There, they grow grains, tubers, vegetables, legumes, and fruits, which are mainly destined for domestic consumption. \r\n\r\nMileni is olive-skinned, of medium height, and has fashionably-styled brown hair. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish for business (she is seated on the right with a light blue top). Because of her need to expand her business, she formed a communal bank of people with similar businesses, like knitting baby clothes, selling fried foods, selling sweatshirts, running a neighborhood shop, and running a meat market, in order to request a loan.\r\n\r\nShe lives her life on her own, together with her three children. The two older children go to school, and they all live in a brick house that has running water and electricity. They do not have a sewage system, and they live on a dirt road. \r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of cosmetics: products used for personal hygiene and to improve the appearance, especially of the face. She makes her sales as a traveling salesperson, visiting nearby communities and provinces with a suitcase and several catalogs to offer her products in shops, offices, etc. Her two years of experience in the field and her family's needs demand the expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nThis is her first lending cycle with the institution. Her dream is for her children to become professionals; she would like to give them a better quality of life by expanding her business and purchasing cosmetics at wholesale. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Mileni is requesting a loan for the purchase of cosmetics at wholesale in order to expand her business so that she can pay for her children's educations.

She has a business selling mobile phones. She is a good mother and is independent, hard-working, steady and very responsible. She works in a market in the \"plan 3000' area which is characterised by the constant growth of its population due to nomadic tribes from places such as 'Los Ayoreos' and miners who have relocated from the west of the country and have made this place their home, generating a steady trade in the whole area.\r\n\r\nRosario has a dark complexion and long dark hair, is of medium height, and dresses fashionably. Her native tongue is Spanish and she knows Guaran\u00ed because of her family background. She is on the right in the photo.\r\n\r\nBecause of her family and  business needs, she set up a communal bank of people with businesses such as a video shop, food sales, plastercraft, soft drinks sales, a bookstore, bakery and butcher's, in order to ask for a loan and prosper from their businesses.\r\n\r\nShe spends her life with her partner, who works as a salaried driver, and their two children. The oldest goes to primary school. They live in their own house which is made of brick and sheet metal and has water, electricity and sewage services.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling mobile phones from a small mobile kiosk. She works from Monday to Saturday because she devotes herself to her children on Sundays. Her kiosk is a small display counter where she has all her products on display and she sets up near the market where there are a lot of people passing by and buying.

The group of women in the area keeps some savings and participates in group activities to generate income. They have been working with these activities for eight years and requested loans, so they are familiar with group work. They formed the board of directors, where Kattia is the president, and wrote the fourth loan request from Banco Mujeres Esforzadas.\r\n\r\nThanks to her hard work, she has been able to have a stable economic activity. She is a businesswoman who sells clothes, shoes, and perfumes, among other things. With this loan, she will be able to improve her group\u2019s working conditions, by making it possible to invest in increasing their stock levels and fulfill their orders, now that the Christmas and New Year celebrations are coming. The summer break lasts until April in the Pacific Coast region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThey collect the payments weekly, which allows them to have a larger payment margin, and they commit to paying off the loan within twelve months.\r\n\r\nSome of the women are heads of household. This is the case of Kattia. She has a ten-year-old daughter and sells clothes and shoes in the area. She has recently started to sell steel jewelry, which she will bring to San Jos\u00e9 from her trips to the border with Panama. She is 35 years old and is a hardworking woman, respected by her community. Besides working in the afternoons, she spends time with her daughter and attends the group\u2019s meetings.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to improve the conditions of their businesses through a loan that is appropriate to their needs. Also, to contribute to the development of the area and of course to the improvement of their families\u2019 living conditions.

She also has been operating a market stand for years that she earns well from.  Having a big family requires more effort to provide for their needs, especially those of her children, so Lilia and her husband have had to work hard to increase their earnings with the goal of providing their children with a better education. \r\n\r\nLilia is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan to purchase more quantities of meat products and other items needed to expand her inventory.

businessman, and they have three children. She manages the household while operating her business, working hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nLilia has operated a general store for 14 years already. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also buys \"taho\" (cooked soya beans) from a wholesaler, selling it at a profit by the cup.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 2000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store, Lilia is requesting a Php 25000 loan to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery items. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nLilia hopes to maintain and grow her business so they can have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1726053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items, beverages and toiletries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-04T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-04T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":191.7,"local_amount":8333.35,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8577.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535896},{"amount":114.99,"local_amount":5000.01,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5146.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134242},{"amount":153.32,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6861.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757010},{"amount":114.99,"local_amount":4999.96,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5146.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200149}],"funded_date":"2014-11-05T01:50:35Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":792280,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a videoke machine rental business in the Philippines.

Having started this business with a purchase of 2 sheep, today, thanks to hard work, Sabira has 2 cows, 1 horse and 10 sheep in her business. She grows barley on 1.50 hectares of land. The business yields a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS). After deciding that this is a profitable business, Sabira requested a loan in the amount of 20,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a dairy cow.

All her children go to school and also help her at home.  Maksatkan has a higher education but she's been involved in agriculture for many years already, growing crops and raising livestock.  She is a very nice and friendly woman.  She is also very sociable and hardworking.  She currently owns six cows, five horses and 10 sheep.

Meet Julius, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 60-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of his family, with a wife and children, he farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kapsowar, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. For the past 10 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been selling milk, eggs and tea. He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. \n\nJulius passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter and another quality breed of dairy cow.\n\nThe chaff cutter will assist Julius in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to feed his cow. Also, it will aid the animal\u2019s digestion and prevent the animals from rejecting any part of their food. Julius also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-25 litres of milk a day. This will enable he will be making USD 11 per day. \n\nBefore Julius joined Juhudi Kilimo, a Kenyan microfinance institution supporting smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, he now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d. \n\nAn increase in income will allow Julius to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Julius fears that his dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide its reliable market channel, credit facility and services that he requires to grow his dairy enterprise."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1722337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a chaff cutter and another quality breed dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-05T00:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nanette S."}},{"id":789655,"name":"Augustine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Augustine is 43 years old and married with four children, and all are able to acquire education.

The unprecedented population surge in Kenya has left the country with nearly 43 million people, and the population continues to increase steadily. This has led to competition and depletion of land and natural resources. In many parts of the country, available land is shrinking, either due to urbanization or cultural land-dividing traditions. For many families struggling to make ends meet, the sale of their land is viewed as the only option. \r\n\r\nKiva Lenders, the picture above presents to you Patrick, a farmer who is struggling to survive. He hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya, an area that is blessed with good climatic conditions and favorable weather patterns that favor farming. Patrick is blessed with a beautiful wife and two lovely children and has been doing farming for the past three years. He was raised in a humble family, and he never got the opportunity to go to college because of a lack of funds for tuition. As a result, he never got any formal employment but didn\u2019t surrender to that. He started farming, and through farming he has been able to take care of his family and also his parents. \r\n\r\nPatrick's income comes from selling vegetables, milk and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Nkubu area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Patrick is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will be able to deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Patrick is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans, through accumulated profits, to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. Patrick\u2019s dream is to go back to school, and he hopes that through your loan, you will help him realize his dream."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1726095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-05T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-05T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6369.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6555.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6747.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6944.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7147.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7356.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7571.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7792.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8020.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8254.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8495.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":8744.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Irwin","image":672153}},{"id":792321,"name":"Rom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rom, 47, comes from Prey Chhor District, Kampong Cham Province.

She is a smallholder farmer, who lives in Cheborgei village in the South Rift area of Kenya. She lives together with her four kids and Stanley, the husband she was married to ten years ago. Beatrice used her secondary education to venture into agribusiness. Starting with nothing more than a rundown four acre piece of land, today Beatrice owns three cows, ten poultry and a cultivated fertile tea farm with more than twenty trees. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is seeking a loan to construct a cowshed for her dairy animals. A byre will help her manage her dairy farming activities better and control the cows' movements. The shelter will also offer protection to the animals against harsh weather.

Even with the savannah plains and little human activity, there exists a farm that stands tall: a farm with over three high-pedigreed Friesian cows, producing over 30 litres of milk. It\u2019s quite an outstanding feat considering the harsh terrain and other handicaps, such as the lack of electricity from the national grid, and also the dependence on traditional methods of collecting water. \r\n\r\nKiva lenders, meet Isaac, the man credited with the success story of the farm. He is a loving husband with two children and has been farming for the past 10 years. Isaac passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that he knows his cows, each individually, because he works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. He and his wife have even named one of them. Because he loves the cows, he runs his operation by four simple rules that have kept him and his herd happy. The rules are: breed them well, feed them well, clean them well, and milk them well. His primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business that he engages in to make ends meet. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs, and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve. \r\n\r\nIsaac is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Juhudi Kilimo serves poor smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like motorbikes, dairy cows, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. Isaac's source of income is vegetable, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Litein area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Isaac is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nIsaac is very determined to succeed, and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. \r\n\r\nLenders, if there is someone you should invest in, that person is Isaac \u2014all he is doing now is waiting for your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1726106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to deliver fresh products to the market on time","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-05T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-05T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5661.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5827.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5997.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6172.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6353.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6538.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6730.06},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6926.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7129.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7337.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7551.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7772.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.62,"local_amount":7610.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7619.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194551},{"amount":130.81,"local_amount":11627.79,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":11642.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823921},{"amount":143.97,"local_amount":12797.43,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12813.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264475},{"amount":519.92,"local_amount":47964.45,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":48024.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.68,"payment_id":681377533}],"funded_date":"2014-12-05T02:51:20Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":792335,"name":"Gilobert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gilobert has a beauty salon, which has been running for two years now.

The Litein area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Vincent is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Through the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nVincent is very determined to succeed, and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents.
