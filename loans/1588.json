He was born in Lebanon and is a Palestinian refugee who lives and works in a Palestinian camp. Jawad is a hard worker who is putting much effort toward developing his family's living, since Palestinians are suffering from limited access to some businesses, working sectors, and services in Lebanon.\r\n\r\nJawad's previous loans from Al Majmoua helped him to develop his family's living through buying a car and using it for rental purposes as an additional income, which helped his family's socioeconomic situation. \r\n\r\nJawad requested his eighth loan from Al Majmoua, which he will use to starting selling perfumes as an additional income. Perfumes are attractive to his current customers and selling them is a step forward towards developing his business career and diversifying his services. \r\n\r\nJawad has worked as a barber for 14 years.

small-scale farmers dominate the agricultural landscape in most production environments in Kenya, yet they constitute the majority of rural actors locked in socio-cultural structures that limit their agricultural productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness at all points across the value chain. Key examples are entrenched inequities in access to productive land, limited access to credit, poor access to markets, extension services, and agricultural technologies relevant to their needs. \r\n\r\nKiva lenders, the above picture presents Doreen, who started farming seven years ago on a small inherited piece of land in Igoki, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of two children sells milk, eggs, vegetables, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart and, every day, she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and it protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions, such as rain. \r\n\r\nDoreen believes that, through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit. Doreen patiently waits for your

She has four children who are already working. She works hard to meet their daily household needs and and to save for their old age.\n\nAlicia is in a food business; she operates a food cart. A food cart is a mobile kitchen that is set up on the street to facilitate the sale and marketing of street food to people from the local pedestrian traffic. She cooks and sells \"siopao\" (steamed buns) which is a famous Filipino-Chinese snack. It is a pork bun recipe that can be eaten straight from the steamer. She sells also \"siomai,\" a traditional Chinese dumpling. This popular dumpling has made its way to the heart of the Filipinos, as evidenced by the hundreds of stalls, eateries, and restaurants who serve them. In the Philippines it is often ground pork, beef, shrimp, among others, combined with extenders like turnips, carrots and other vegetables which are then wrapped in wanton wrappers or molo wrappers. It is either steamed or fried resulting in a crispy exterior. It can be eaten solo as a snack, or served with rice to make a full meal, so you can sell it anytime of the day. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippines Pesos (PHP) net income a day.\n\nTo help her maintain her business, Alicia is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to buy additional raw ingredients like pork, beef, chicken and seasonings, vegetables and other ingredients that are needed for her cooking. From her food cart earnings she was able to open a small general store. Part of the loan will be used to buy grocery items such as biscuits, rice, beverages and toiletries for her newly opened small store. She believes that with this financial assistance her sales and earnings will increase. She is thanking God in advance for your great help.\n\nAlicia dreams to establish and expand her business so they could have a comfortable life on their old age. She also wants to live healthy and happy to see her grandchildren grow up. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1723200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery for ingredients for her food cart and also to pay for items, toiletries and beverages to sell at her newly opened general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-05T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-05T17:10:12Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":315,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":14173.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535857},{"amount":135,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6074.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134203},{"amount":180,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8099.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611756971},{"amount":45,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200114}],"funded_date":"2014-11-05T20:47:35Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Smit","image":null}},{"id":788937,"name":"Mirna Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirna de 41 a\u00f1os de edad es madre soltera vive en casa propia con sus dos hijos quienes trabajan y le ayudan econ\u00f3micamente, ella se dedica desde hace varios a\u00f1os a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de tortillas, su negocio est\u00e1 ubicado en su lugar de residencia y tiene muchos clientes, ella est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de ma\u00edz por quintales y cal para poder continuar con la elaboraci\u00f3n de las tortillas y as\u00ed poder tener mejores ingresos para tener una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Mirna, 41 years old, is a single mother.

It was a marsh before the late 60s when, with volunteer work, it became a little town with a few buildings and agricultural land where sugar beets have since been planted. A factory of sugar was built also, where alcoholic drinks were made in addition to the sugar. Since the region was producing large quantities of potatoes, a factory for cornstarch was built a few years later and functioned until the first years after the collapse of the previous regime. Unfortunately, no sugar beets are planted and no sugar plant is functioning,except the cornstarch plant.

me the opportunity to do more in life for more reasons,\u201d said Geeta as she narrates her story. She is an active woman who believes in the financial freedom of all women. \u201cEvery single cloth I have woven is not merely a product but is precious and meaningful to me because that is where my strength lies,\u201d she said. She has three school-going children. Her husband is engaged in school van services for income generation. She took a loan from WSDS in the previous years to buy raw materials for weaving. The income she derived from weaving was used for providing household expenses and other fees. She holds a good record of repaying the loan amount on time. She makes wraparounds costing from 250 INR to 500 INR at home and sells them through her elder sister who is a school teacher. The wraparounds are very popular among the lady teachers in school and they used to place orders for different designs of their own liking. This made her business popular and successful. Now she aspires to buy a handloom to weave more products to sell. With the Kiva loan, she will buy a handloom so that she can weave more beautiful wraparound to attract more customers. She says \u201cthank you Kiva.\u201d The other group members also will promote their business through the Kiva loan.

be young and starting a new family with a fragment of land is a challenge for people in the Litein area of Kenya. Rose, 30, has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary source of income has been selling eggs, milk, vegetables and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Rose, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble farmer has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and it protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Through the loan, she will also be able to buy a chaff cutter which is a mechanical device used to cut hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage for better feeding of the cow. The chaff cutter also prevents the animals from rejecting any part of the food.

Today, this humble mother of three children sells milk, eggs, vegetables and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Juliana believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Meet Salome, from Kapsowar, Kenya. Kapsowar is an area where the earth is red and smells fresh from the rain. The trees are lush, and tiny, matchbox-like, mud brick houses with tin roofs line either side of the dirt roads. Salome is happily married, and she and her husband have been blessed with four lovely children.\r\n\r\nFor the past nine years Salome has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, vegetables, and some personal business she engages in to make extra cash. Salome has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She passionately loves dairy farming. \u201cCows are part of me. I love cows, I walk cows, I sleep cows, I eat cows,\u201d she says. The village women call her Mrs. Cow.\r\n\r\nShe sells milk to her neighbours and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nSalome is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling. She will also start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":761.32,"image":{"id":1726329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-05T20:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-05T20:10:19Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6262.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6445.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.52,"local_amount":10793.31,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10952.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194564},{"amount":123.93,"local_amount":10917.89,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":11079.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262381},{"amount":514.87,"local_amount":45358.25,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":46029.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600693}],"funded_date":"2014-11-13T04:45:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":792526,"name":"Edmond","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edmond is a motorcycle mechanic and has been in this business for 4 years.

She is very sociable and hard working. She has five cows and five horses at her farm. Guluipa also has 0.40 hectares of own land where she grows barley, which she sells wholesale. The family's total income is around 11,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Guluipa decided to turn to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) per month to purchase a cow. She plans to use the income from the loan to build a large barn for the livestock and start building a new home, as the old one has

In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy some calves to increase her livestock headcount.  She will keep the calves that she buys on her own farm.  Zhanyl plans to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her herd.

He would like to hire additional weavers for his workshop and invest in a bulk purchase of wood and thread. Estuardo has been selling through NOVICA since 2012. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to my parents I've learned everything about handicrafts and I find interesting how today's artisans continue to use the type of tools and techniques developed by the ancient Maya. My first items were white hammocks using the natural color of the threads, and then we began to weave them in different colors, always making sure we made improvements where needed, according to what people were looking for. Throughout this time I've learned a lot and have had many great experiences. The people who know me would tell you I'm quite the enthusiast and charismatic, as well as a go-getter. I love to play sports, study and go out with my friends. I am a man of simple means that enjoys life just as it is, and has a positive outlook on life. I have faith in everything I undertake. I feel very proud of what we have achieved so far. I'm involved in every step from designing the hammock and choosing the colors of the threads and pinewood. It feels amazing to see how something that began as an idea in my head becomes a finished product. I feel proud to represent one of Guatemala's textile traditions, because the world deserves to know about the beautiful things our culture has to offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks, my friends, for believing in our craft and our vision.

She has the equivalent of a high school education and is involved in animal husbandry and crop farming, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this field in 1996 with the purchase of some cattle for 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she now owns six cows and three calves, as well as a two-hectare plot of land on which she grows potatoes and corn.  She makes a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS).  Mariya is the member of a group named \"Nichkesai\" which consists of three more people.  In order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy some calves for fattening and resale.

The memory of this collective effort led her to join Cheplanget youth self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor the past year she has been actively involved in mixed farming, and because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and fuel wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a set back because Betty has been making great profits in farming. \r\n\r\nBetty has one of the places that has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming - that is good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Betty  has always wanted to diversify and start horticulture farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds to start the business off the ground. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to start horticulture farming. Through Cheplanget youth self-help group (a group where members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan), she joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a micro finance that supports young and enterprising farmers. \r\n\r\nWith your loan she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes.

All the group members belong to a registered vibrant farming association. Amadu is 45 years old this year, and is happily married with two children, ages 18 and 8. Both of his children are in school. Amadu lives with his family in Abura Koforidua, in the central region of Ghana. \r\n\r\nAmadu has been farming for the past 12 years, and has gained much experience. He grows oranges on ten acres of land. He is also a tailor, and though the tailoring business is doing well, his main source of income is still the farm. Amadu's farming association has obtained a contractual agreement with a local company that purchases the crops for processing into juice. \r\n\r\nHe just needs to maximize his profit now, and his only challenge is the difficulty in getting the micro loans from financial institutions locally to finance the costs required to maintain the farm and harvest the crops. In particular, Amadu needs to hire laborers for weeding, harvesting the crops, and transporting them to a sale centre for sale. \r\n\r\nA micro loan will help  Amadu to maintain his farm to increase his profit significantly, and his profits would far exceed the capital he needs to invest in his farm now. Amadu will use the gain from the farm to care for his family, and also help pay the school fees for his children.

She has two children who are ten and fourteen years old and works selling strawberries in bulk. \r\n\r\nJuana is enterprising, independent, a good mother, tenacious, courageous and hardworking. She works in the 'la ramada' zone, which is known for its sale of merchandise in bulk and in large quantities. There they generally welcome the intermediaries and distributors who buy their products in bulk and then resell them to other vendors at higher and unreasonably elevated prices.\r\n\r\nJuana has dark skin, long black hair and is average height (standing in the middle in a striped purple blouse and black pants). Her native language is guarani which she no longer uses; instead she speaks Spanish due to her work in the city. She lives independently with her children who go to school. They live in a rented brick house which has electricity and water.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Juana formed a group of people so she could apply for a loan and improve her business. The group run businesses such as selling clothing, fruit, tomatoes, knitted items and fish; running a sewing workshop, a clothing workshop and a construction service\r\n\r\nJuana sells strawberries in bulk. The fieldworkers come to her selling point to deliver great quantities of strawberries which she displays and sells in large quantities. This is her second loan cycle with the institution after eight years of experience in the business. Her dream is to expand her business by making strawberry desserts. She thinks it will be a prosperous business because her customers are asking her for this dish and without having made anything she already has some orders. This is why Juana is applying for a loan to expand her business: so she can make strawberry desserts to please her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1721383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to expand her store by making strawberry desserts to please her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-06T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-06T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Roxa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruperta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wily Waldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2019.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1957.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2053.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2062.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2099.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2137.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2176.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2216.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2256.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2297.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2339.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":284.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":298.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":299.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":321.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":875.68,"local_amount":6031.16,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6050.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556628},{"amount":914.65,"local_amount":6299.54,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6319.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157314},{"amount":637.84,"local_amount":4393.09,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4407.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554211},{"amount":661.27,"local_amount":4554.46,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4569.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226752},{"amount":685.56,"local_amount":4721.75,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4736.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213929}],"funded_date":"2014-11-07T00:00:56Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":792861,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a buy-and-sell vegetables business in the Philippines. <br \/><br \/>She is borrowing PHP 12,000 through NWTF to buy vegetables to sell in her food stall for her buy-and-sell vegetables business.<br \/><br \/>Lourdes has been in this business for nine years.

In order to create this incense, the magnonkiss\u00e8ni seeds are soaked in the eau de Cologne for at least two weeks before being imbued with the perfumes. Once the product has taken on these impeccable odours, it is ready to be sold in exchange for credit in Sabalibougou to a female-majority customer base.

She also has a bee yard, and grows barley on a leased land plot. Her monthly income is 25,000 KGS.

She studied through high school.  She was in a committed relationship but her partner died. Currently she lives alone in her own home and no one depends on her. \r\n\r\nRoxana is a business woman.  She began working for a business that sells nutritional supplements.  She worked as a saleswoman and she still collaborates with that business.  She began her own store in her home five years ago, and she has managed it herself and also had the help of her partner who has since deceased.  Two years ago she completed a degree in bread-making offered through the local government in her town and a few months later she purchased an oven and currently she is selling bread products throughout the city. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan in order to invest in her store.  She will buy basic grains, condiments, and products for baking, articles for personal hygiene, candies, and drinks in order to keep her store supplied so that she can satisfy customer demands and keep her clients happy. \r\n\r\nRoxana sees a positive future in the making and selling of bread, which is why she dreams of having a bread shop that is stable and capable of improving her quality of life.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1721306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy basic grains, condiments, and products for baking, articles for personal hygiene, candies, and drinks in order to keep her store supplied","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-06T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-06T15:50:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana Jeannette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536710}],"funded_date":"2014-11-11T16:26:26Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:20:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":792944,"name":"Thu's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Thu, born in 1972, is a Kinh person.

32 years old, divorced and lives with his two school-age children. Altynbek works at a heating boiler station in the winter, but is primarily involved in animal husbandry and farming. He inherited 2 horses and 20 sheep. Today, thanks to his hard work, Altynbek's business contains 1 cow, 2 bulls, 15 sheep and 2 horses. He also has 1.11 hectares of owned land, where he planted potatoes and sainfoin. In order to further develop his business, Altynbek requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy sheep and a dairy cow.

lenders. Meet Evaline, a very industrious, honest, and hardworking woman from the Kericho area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley. \r\n\r\nEvaline, 34, has been farming for the past 10 years. Over this time, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She practices mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, vegetables, and other various crops, as well as some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nEvaline is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not doing comfortably and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nKenya's Kericho area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Evaline could increase her profits by satisfying the demand. \r\n\r\nWhile accessing capital has been a challenge for Evaline, she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Evaline believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the market's demand for cereals. \r\n\r\nEvaline also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Evaline to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":207.8,"image":{"id":1727103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-06T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-06T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":2040.77,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2051.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194570},{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":3071.07,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3087,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823973},{"amount":18.17,"local_amount":1614.89,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1623.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264489},{"amount":18.12,"local_amount":1610.37,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1618.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600699},{"amount":17.98,"local_amount":1652.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1660.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":681377546},{"amount":16.36,"local_amount":1513.64,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.67,"payment_id":696587276},{"amount":19.17,"local_amount":1826.51,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1835.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":711505552},{"amount":44.55,"local_amount":4158.99,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4180.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.24,"payment_id":731022387},{"amount":10.58,"local_amount":981.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":986.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.46,"payment_id":752110648}],"funded_date":"2014-11-12T12:47:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":792976,"name":"Kim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Kim, born in 1990, is a Thai ethnic person.

The object of this new fanancing is to invest working capital in purchasing general merchandise such as various styles of shoes, cosmetics, clothing for adults and children, and adornments, and to take advantage of these final months before Christmas when sales are greater, and to purchase products for making soups, buying shell fish, shrimp, lemons, onions, tomatoes, and salsas, among other things. \r\n\r\nMercedes del Socorro is very grateful for the help Kiva investors offer to people of reduced economic resources.

Meet Caroline, 40 years of age, a very hard-working, honest, and dedicated farmer, who lives in Kaptumo, a remote village in Nandi Hills. She is happily married and blessed with six adorable children. \r\n\r\nFor the last ten years, Caroline has been practicing mixed farming and she has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small, personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Nandi Hills area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. \r\n\r\nCaroline lacks funds to increase her poultry farming and she is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, she feels relieved, knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Caroline will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry business to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe extra income Caroline will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1727112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-06T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-06T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.22,"local_amount":11219.15,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":11277.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625384},{"amount":36.17,"local_amount":3214.95,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3231.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194571},{"amount":112.59,"local_amount":10008.37,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10060.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264490},{"amount":119.3,"local_amount":10962.5,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":11019.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.03,"payment_id":681377547},{"amount":49.21,"local_amount":4595.03,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4618.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.48,"payment_id":731022388}],"funded_date":"2014-11-18T07:15:33Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":793000,"name":"Caren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Five years ago, Caren started farming on a small, inherited piece of land in Cheplangat, a remote village in the Litein area of Kenya.

Gulsara has a higher education and works as an English-language teacher at a school. Also, to provide additional income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business in 1995 with an 8,000 som (KGS) purchase of livestock. Thanks to Gulsara's hard work, today her business contains 2 cows, 4 horses, and 2.60 hectares of land, where she annually grows barley for the household consumption and sale. Gulsara's monthly income amounts to about 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Gulsara requested a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy livestock feed. Gulsara wants to retain and increase her livestock headcount in order to have an ability to save money for her son's wedding.

Meet Agnes, a hardworking, very honest and warm-hearted farmer who hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Agnes is the proud mother of five lovely children whom she really loves and adores and always protects. Agnes' upbringing was very challenging, and because of this, she promised herself that she would work hard to get out of poverty. That is why she started farming eight years ago. Through farming, she has been able to earn a decent income. Agnes is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her three children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nAgnes is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticulture farming. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Agnes is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change. Through the income from horticulture farming, Agnes will assure her children of a bright future and will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her. Through your loan, the promise of supporting small-scale farmers will be achieved."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1727146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-06T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-06T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.31,"local_amount":824.65,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":921.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625387},{"amount":10.82,"local_amount":865.93,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":967.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194574},{"amount":19.1,"local_amount":1528.31,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823977},{"amount":10.02,"local_amount":801.82,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":895.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264492},{"amount":10.02,"local_amount":801.96,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":895.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600702},{"amount":10.73,"local_amount":858.78,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":959.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459168},{"amount":10.71,"local_amount":886.41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":990.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.37,"payment_id":681377550},{"amount":10.6,"local_amount":882.98,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":986.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.44,"payment_id":696587277},{"amount":10.88,"local_amount":932.95,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1041.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":711505555},{"amount":19.25,"local_amount":1616.21,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1805.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.97,"payment_id":731022390}],"funded_date":"2014-11-06T21:32:25Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":793020,"name":"Gertrudes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gertrudes is 62 years old and married with six children.
