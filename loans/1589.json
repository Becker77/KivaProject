She lives in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills, carpeted in manicured tea plantations. Annah is a mother of six children and she has been in the agriculture business for ten years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea. \r\n\r\nAnnah has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as fertilizer, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Annah remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nAnnah is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Annah will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her is timely since it will enable her to tackle high, farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better quality produce and more yields.\r\n\r\n This loan will support Annah\u2019s economic activity and will indirectly change her family\u2019s living standards."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1727158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

After subtracting the investment cost, there is only enough money to cover daily living and she can only save a very small amount. With awareness of environmental protection, she always wants to use organic fertilizer for her coffee garden, but due to the cost of organic fertilizer, which is much higher than chemical fertilizer, she does not have enough money to use it.\r\n\r\nPang hopes her coffee garden will have a higher yield by using organic fertilizer, thus improving her family life, and hopefully the environment will

Today, this humble mother of two children sells milk, eggs, tea and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and it protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Caren believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Meet Leah, 36 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kaptumo, a remote village in Nandi hills. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Nandihills area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions.

Meet Hellen, a dedicated, determined and honest mother of six lovely children. She is based in Nkubu, Kenya. The rich soil of this area makes it one of the nation\u2019s biggest tea growing regions, lending it the nickname of  \u201ctea region\u201d. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been selling milk, eggs, tea and a variety of food crops. These ventures have allowed her earn a decent income. Hellen passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is the lack of funds. \r\n\r\nHowever, this challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family and children,\u201d she said.

En las plantaciones se puede cosechar la resina de hasta 800 \u00e1rboles por hect\u00e1rea, mientras que en el monte natural solo se cosecha lo de 80 pinos. \n\nSus planes en el futuro son tener plantaciones de pino resinero que sirvan de ejemplo para la comunidad y que generen mayores ingresos econ\u00f3micos, ya que sue\u00f1a con transmitir a sus hijos el amor por el trabajo de la resina y el bosque y ense\u00f1arlos para que ellos sepan y puedan vivir de \u00e9l.  Le llena de orgullo poder  vivir y trabajar en armon\u00eda con el bosque, ya que la resinaci\u00f3n se realiza en una zona natural de monta\u00f1as de pinos.\n\nAgradece a los prestamistas por su apoyo y su inter\u00e9s por el cuidado de la naturaleza, ya que no a todas la personas nos interesa cuidar el medio ambiente, le gustar\u00eda platicarles que la resina de pino se ha usado por miles de a\u00f1os en beneficio de la humanidad y que el bosque trae muchos m\u00e1s beneficios que solo darnos ox\u00edgeno.\n\nSu mayor reto es conseguir un precio de garant\u00eda rentable que permita conservar el entusiasmo por el oficio del resinero. En Michoac\u00e1n este oficio es muy viejo pues es sabido que aquellos bosques que se resinan, se conservan mejor ya que un resinero es el mejor amigo del bosque.\n\nEl grupo ha acordado destinar los recursos del pr\u00e9stamo, exclusivamente para establecer las plantaciones comerciales de 30 mil pinos resineros, para incrementar la cosecha de resina. Opinan que es de mucha ayuda no tener que utilizar los pocos ingresos que se tienen para atender las necesidades de la  familia a los proyectos de las nuevas plantaciones.\n","en":"To find out more about how Ejido Verde is working to create opportunity for indigenous populations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SM2xd2GyDH8&feature=youtu.be\">watch this video<\/a>\n\nThis group is called the \u201cResinersos de Curucupaceo\u201d because all of the members collect pine resin.  They are all neighbors in the San Diego and La Cumbre community, which is a rugged and mountainous area in the Madero municipality in the state of Michoac\u00e1n.\n\nJenaro, age 39, is the member who represents the group.  He is married to Elvia, and they have five children.  They have two girls; Alondra, age 4; and Jazm\u00edn, age 9; and three boys; Genaro, the oldest, is 14; Ivan, who is in fifth grade, is 12; and the Cristian, the littlest, is in first grade.  They all go to school.\n\nWhen he was a boy Jenaro inherited the trade of collecting resin from his father.  To date, it is his primary support and his only source of financial income.  The work consists of getting resin from the pine trees.  It starts very early, going to the trees to collect the resin, storing the resin at his house, and then transporting it 150 kilometers to the capital of the state in order to sell it.  This is in addition to taking care of the trees so that they do not get infested or burn on the mountain.\n\nTogether with the group, he plans to use the loan to reforest areas that do not have woods so as to be able to have a greater pine resin harvest.  He will do this in order to have a better quality of life and to improve his finances.\n\nIn the land that is planted you can harvest the resin of up to 800 trees per hectare, while you can only harvest 80 pines growing naturally on the mountain.\n\nHis plans for the future are to have resin producing pine trees planted to serve as an example for the community and generate greater income.  He dreams of passing on to his children his love for working with resin and the forest.  He also dreams of teaching them so that they know that they can make a living from doing so.\n\nIt fills him with pride to be able to live and work in harmony with the forest.  This is because he works with resin in a natural area of pines on the mountains.\n\nHe is grateful to the lenders for their support and their interest in the care of nature.  Not everyone is interested in taking care of the environment.  He would like to tell them that pine resin has been used for thousands of years to benefit humanity, and that the forest brings more benefits than just giving us oxygen.\n\nHis biggest challenge is getting a guaranteed profitable price that allows him to stay enthusiastic about the trade of harvesting pine resin.  In Michoac\u00e1n this trade is very old.  It is known that the forests that produce resin are better preserved because a resin worker is the best friend of the forest.\n\nThe group has agreed to use the loan exclusively to establish the commercial planting of 30,000 resin producing pines in order to increase the resin harvest.  They feel that it is a big help not to have to use the little earnings that they have to take care of the family necessities on the project for the new plantings.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":27000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1698139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Flexible Credit Study","Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"to buy and plant resin producing pine trees.

Meet Romana, a mother of four from Nandi Hills, a remote town in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past four years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business, to make ends meet. Romana is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her animals. She is so close with her chickens that she has nicknamed one of them \u201cKipara,\u201d meaning no feathers on the head. Lydia wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan of KES 20,000, which she will use to buy additional chickens. With your loan, Romana will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm.

Through perseverance, dedication and hard work, her inventory is currently worth 130,000 som (KGS).  In addition, she has a small farming business and raises 15 sheep.  Since she sells her shoes at a price lower than the average market price, many customers come to her retail outlet and her goods are in high demand.

She has a specialized secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry and crop farming since 1998.  These two activities constitute her family's main source of income.  She currently owns four cows, five sheep and one hectare of land on which she grows wheat, corn and garlic for resale.  Thanks to her very hard work and to her children's help, her farming business brings her a monthly income of about 10,000 som (KGS).  However, this amount of money is not sufficient for a decent living and to provide for the family.  For this reason, and eager to further develop her farming business, Urinsa has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy livestock.

Meet Ruth, 29 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Nyakoe, a remote village in Kisii. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. \r\n\r\nTo make ends meet and to make extra cash, Ruth has been engaging in another small personal business. The Kisii area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 15,000 KES to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, Ruth feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, which will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and to expand her poultry market to other markets, which will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going

Her children are adults and living independently.  Only her youngest son still lives at home.  Kulmairam has the equivalent of a high school education and she has been involved in agriculture for many years, having started in 1998, practically from scratch.  She currently makes an income of about 20,000 som (KGS) per month.  She owns one cow and two calves, and she also grows potatoes and beans on three hectares of land.  She harvests organic and delicious crops and sells them to wholesale buyers.  In addition, Kulmairam also sews traditional Tajik clothes and blankets.  Eager to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy fertilizers to prepare her land for the cultivation of beans and to purchase fuel needed for farm work.  She is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further developing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1727379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers and fuel needed for farm work, in order to grow organic beans.

fills Rosaline with enthusiasm and inspiration. Rosaline is 37 years old and works tirelessly to raise animals. Through these humble tasks, she aspires to offer all of her children a university education. Rosaline learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to her parents. She has a tiny plot of land to live off \u2013 just under half an acre \u2013 and has always struggled to support her family. She has developed the farm in the sloping undulating terrain by successfully adopting suitable soil and water conservation methods such as stone pitched bench terracing and digging rain water storage pits. For over five years, her income source has been from selling milk and poultry. She supplements the meager income by doing other business. Rosaline passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family, and she wants her cows to produce more milk. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy animal feed. With this animal feed, her cows will be able to increase milk production, which will translate to increased income.

She lives with her partner and has three children who are 27, 23, and 14 years old. She has a business selling soft drinks.\r\n\r\nShe is enterprising, a good mother, hardworking, and responsible. She works in the \"Plan 3000\" neighborhood, an area characterized by the growing population of indigenous Ayorea people and relocated miners from the west that have settled in the area. The climate is tropical, with an average temperature of 27-32 degrees centigrade year round. \r\n\r\nRuthi has short black hair. Her first language is Spanish and she speaks Quechua because of her family's heritage (she is the second from the right, in the dress with flowers on it). She lives with her partner, who works in construction, and their two younger children. The oldest is already independent. She lives in a rented brick house that has electricity and running water. Her desire to get ahead led her to start a communal bank with members who have businesses such as: a video store, selling sandwiches, plaster artworks, soft drinks, stationary store, and cosmetics sales. She did this so they all could request loans and and expand their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business sells soft drinks from her store. Because of the climate of the area, there is a lot of demand for her soft drinks. She currently buys ice every day and keeps her products cold in a cooler. This is her third loan cycle with the institution in four years of experience with the business. Her dream is to open a soft drink distribution business so she can sell wholesale. She wants to grow her business through the purchase of  a refrigerator, where she can keep her products cool so her customers will be satisfied and so she can save money from not buying ice, and have more time and money.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Ruthi is requesting a loan, to buy a refrigerator to expand her business and keep her clients happy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4675,"image":{"id":1721479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator to expand her business and keep her clients happy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-07T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-07T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":4675,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruthi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rossy Yhanyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sila Heidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lisper Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cintia Jhovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raymundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4026},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4255.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4410.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4571.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4737.59},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4910.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5088.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":588.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":621.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":644.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":667.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":692.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":588.17,"local_amount":4026,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4034.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556630},{"amount":621.74,"local_amount":4255.75,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4265.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157316},{"amount":1312.2,"local_amount":8981.87,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":9001.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554213},{"amount":692.13,"local_amount":4737.59,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4748.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226754},{"amount":1460.76,"local_amount":9998.79,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10020.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213931}],"funded_date":"2014-11-18T13:25:14Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:27:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":793185,"name":"Carlota","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carlota is a 31-year-old married woman with three children, two of whom are currently in school.

The 47-year-old mother of four is a smallholder farmer based in Kapsowar, found in the North Rift region of Kenya. The secondary-educated entrepreneur runs a mixed farm in which she keeps three fairly productive dairy cows that produce milk for both consumption and sale. Christine started farming in 1998. She farms on a 1\/4 acre piece of land that belongs to her husband, whose professional activities have very little to do with agriculture. She was doing it for subsistence but recently switched to commercial produce. The income she made from this transition greatly improved her income status to enable her to afford her children a better education at standard private schools. Christine has one employee to help her run the farm business when she is attending her day job or doing her side job, which involves selling cosmetic products for extra income. Christine is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter and animal feed. She places more premiums on animal health and nutrition in her dairy business than other factors. Animal feed has a lot to do with the proper composition of the animal products that she sells to her customers. She is seeking this loan to ensure that her animals have the proper feed composition that they require. The chaff cutter is handy during feed preparation to ensure that hay is evenly cut into appropriately small pieces that cows will enjoy to ingest and easily digest. Returns from this investment will enable Christine to pay for her children's education expenses. She wants nothing but the best foundation for her children's future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1727336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Like many smallholder farmers in Kenya, she owns a tiny inherited plot of land to live off of, just under half an acre, and has always struggled to support her family. Her primary source of income has been crops and some small personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. \r\n\r\nFrida passionately loves dairy farming, but one challenge she has been facing is lack of water for home consumption and irrigating her farm. Most of the rainwater goes to waste and therefore Frida is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to buy a water tank. With the water tank she will be able to harvest and store rainwater in the tank. This loan will be of much help because Frida will not be walking for long distances in search of this precious commodity. The tank will assist her in irrigating her farm, hence increasing productivity and income levels. All that Frida waits for is your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1727458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-07T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-07T16:40:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.8,"local_amount":1493.43,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1501.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625398},{"amount":17.43,"local_amount":1549.29,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1557.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194589},{"amount":16.18,"local_amount":1438.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611823992},{"amount":57.45,"local_amount":5106.99,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5133.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264499},{"amount":12.61,"local_amount":1158.14,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1164.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":681377565},{"amount":39.74,"local_amount":3677.24,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3696.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.63,"payment_id":696587281},{"amount":19.23,"local_amount":1831.59,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1841.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.38,"payment_id":711505568},{"amount":40.12,"local_amount":3744.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3764.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.01,"payment_id":731022396}],"funded_date":"2014-11-07T22:38:39Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":793283,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Maria is 37 years old and married.

He has been doing this work for six good years. \r\n\r\nPhilip's primary income sources are milk, bananas, and motorcycle transportation services. The father of three stated that milking is the most enjoyable of his activities on the farm. He is very connected with his dairy animals and has assigned a name to each of them. He has dreams of growing his dairy farm by herding more animals and buying more land. \r\n\r\nPhilip is seeking a loan of KES 31,200 only to purchase a dairy cow. Business-related expenses keep rising by the day forcing farmers and businessmen alike to reduce costs and\/or increase sales. The additional cow will help in the utilization of pasture and will increase milk production and availability of more by-products. Philip will be able to save a bit on expenses such as fertilizer.

the smallholder category. The village of Kemera, where Paul resides, has largely stayed under-developed, with farmers persistently following traditional cultivation practices and mostly preferring to cultivate bananas. \r\n\r\nPaul has been practicing dairy farming, disrupting the traditional practice of cultivating bananas with an objective to improve his socio-economic status. The prevailing geological conditions of the village make it extremely suitable for dairy farming. The major challenge he faces is a lack of funds to push his dairy farming a notch higher. He is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The additional cow will help in the use of pasture, and will increase milk production and availability to produce more byproducts. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan, Paul will be able to challenge the existing norms and bring better and advanced dairy farming practices to his village, thus becoming a torchbearer for change in his village for others to follow.

She works selling secondhand clothing and other items door to door for credit or cash, depending on the customer.\r\n\r\nShe began her retail business in 2001 with a friend when she sold her clothes at lower prices than in the neighbourhood and made a profit. She liked this experience and alternates this with being a mother, wife and managing her home. Today, 13 years later, she dreams of having a larger business, better housing and to achieve her greatest challenge, which is simply to please her customers and to give them what they like and need with what she sells: used clothing. \r\n\r\nElenith is out of her home every day from 8am until 8pm. Her neighbours are her biggest customers and in this season when the holidays are approaching, she is overwhelmed with orders that Elenith wants to meet.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is going to a credikiva, the first funding from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, through which she will buy used clothing and household items with Christmas decorations.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, her inventories will increase to provide her with more market opportunities as she will have a cash flow that will allow her to buy more than before her credikiva and this is good for business and making her investment

Introducing you to Justine, a 33-year-old honest, hard-working and ever-smiling father of 1 adorable child. He hails from Nyamira in Kenya, a banana-growing area where the staple food is \u201cmatoke\u201d, a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from bananas. Justine has been involved in farming for the past 10 years and he owns dairy cows that produce milk for sale. Besides his dairy cows, he also keeps poultry and when you visit his farm you will witness tea growing as well as a variety of vegetables. Justine has a passion for dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cNyabarati\u201d (from a person's name); but all is not well for this humble man. He is facing the challenge of the lack of a proper dairy unit which is why he is seeking funds to construct a proper dairy unit. With your loan, he will be able to better manage his dairy farm and create more value. A better dairy unit will assist Justine to save more money because his cows will never be sick and this will also boost his dairy's milk production. Through building a dairy unit with the loan, Justine will be able to collect the cows' by-products, namely, cow dung and urine which can be sold or better yet used on his farm. With a dairy unit, he will be able to better feed his animals and collect by-products such as dung to generate biogas fuel, make organic fertilizer and plaster his hut. The money that he will earn from the dairy unit will be reinvested back into the business to create growth. Joseph is a very ambitious man and he projects that through the loan he will have higher quality dairy cows and be able to permanently change his living conditions and secure his children's future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":619.35,"image":{"id":1728000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a proper dairy unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T00:50:06Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":111.91,"local_amount":9947.74,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9999.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194594},{"amount":106.23,"local_amount":9442.69,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9491.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262406},{"amount":103.6,"local_amount":9209.09,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":9256.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600721},{"amount":116.69,"local_amount":10722.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":10778.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.94,"payment_id":681377570},{"amount":47.74,"local_amount":4549.64,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4573.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.44,"payment_id":711505572},{"amount":120.57,"local_amount":11182.12,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":11240.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.23,"payment_id":752110659}],"funded_date":"2014-12-01T23:39:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Pittenger","image":278831}},{"id":793592,"name":"Ulezi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce, who is in her early 50s is married with three children who are still at school.
