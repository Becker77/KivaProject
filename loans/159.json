She earns her living by running an eatery.\r\n\r\nRovelyn\u2019s husband, Richard, is helping his wife run the eatery business. They have two children who are three and five years old. They strive hard to prepare for the future of their children, hoping to provide them with a good education and a comfortable life.\r\n\r\nRovelyn H. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in an eatery business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nRovelyn H. is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 was used to fund operations of her eatery business, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing PHP 10,000 for her fourth loan. She intends to use the loan on her eatery business. Rovelyn H. is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":475243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

One of her cousins allows her to use a storage space which is located near her clients, in order to store her cleaning products. Adelia hopes to use this loan to purchase various cleaning products which she plans to sell to mechanics. She says that the products she sells are top quality products in high demand.\r\n\r\nThe loan consultant who has been working with Adelia describes her as a hardworking entrepreneur with a fighting spirit who is dedicated to her business. Adelia has lupus, but she doesn\u00b4t let her illness prevent her from living a normal life. In general, Adelia carries out domestic tasks in the mornings: preparing breakfast and lunch, cleaning the house, etc. The afternoons are dedicated to her business: seeking new clients, collecting payments from existing clients and making sales. Adelia's goal is to one day work in a centralized location, a small store, where she could offer her clients various cleaning products. At the moment, the only factor standing in the way of progress is a lack of working capital.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeodora hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she fervently hopes that her business will stabilize and be successful one day.

Before she sold tamales she also sold cosmetics and clothing to the tobacco factory workers.  Now she buys 1,500 ears of corn every three days and has five sellers and three bicycles that they use to sell the products in the streets.  She would like for her products to be sold in the fairs and supermarkets in order to increase her sales.  \r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy 4000 ears of corn as this will help her to buy ingredients and increase her sales.

They have five children, only one of which lives with them in the farmhouse they own in Huanchan. Luisa has been farming for 28 years. Her main crops are potatoes, peas, maize, and beans, which she plants on her 18-hectare farm.\r\n\r\nWhat Luisa most enjoys about her work is selling her harvest in the local markets so that she can see the results of her hard work. She also raises small livestock such as cows, pigs and rams. After raising the animals she sells them at a higher price, averaging about 150 PEN per animal and higher for male animals. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is lack of working capital, since she can't rely on daily income. Luisa belongs to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Huanchan\u201d community bank, and this is her third loan with MFP. She is grateful for the continuous support from her bank.

These items are purchased at the main market of SAN City. Following the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain value. And then they are sold retail (and often in bulk) and for cash at the main markets of SAN and DAH and at surrounding markets.

There are 52 \"comunidades\", \"recintos\" and \"cooperativas distribuidas\" [local geographical entities] in the canton, along with important resources such as the Mindo Nambillo National Forest.  Much of the canton is pasture land and ranching is an important business.  Local farmers grow palmito, sugar cane, platanos and fruit on small plots here.  Pedro has lived on his own for a year.  He has a son, but the son doesn't live with him.\r\n\r\nPedro's parents have a natural medicines business and he learned the business from them.  He opened his own shop 5 years ago and has made good progress.  He wants to expand the business now and he needs a loan because he can't add the inventory he wants without one.

Norma is a schoolteacher, but she is not paid enough to live on, so she also sells dry goods (rice, sugar, flour) at the local Sunday market. When she first started it was tough, since people gossiped about her having to have two jobs, but she says she has gotten past that. In the beginning, her husband didn't want to let her go out to the market to work as a vendor, but once he realized she was earning money he started to help her. Today, Norma says that her business has grown a lot since she started working with FINCA, and her husband is now very understanding. She has developed a better relationship with her family, too. Norma is requesting a loan of 600 soles (US$200) to buy a wider variety of merchandise to sell at her market stall. Norma's dream is to buy a car and for her children to graduate with professional degrees. \n\nMartina is married with two children who are 18 and 12 years old. Martina sells lamb soup and chicken soup in local markets, and also sells at meetings of the \"Juntos\" program. She has increased her sales since she started selling soup at these meetings, since she used to just work at markets. Martina is requesting a loan of 600 soles to buy more lamb to make soup to bring to other local markets. She says that FINCA has taught her good values and how to be responsible with herself and her family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent have viable business propositions.

que sue\u00f1a verlo crecer y ayudarla a su prosperidad familiar, para lo cual dirige todos sus esfuerzos.   \n \nNora se siente satisfecha de la vida, da gracias a Dios diariamente por estar viva y reafirma el proverbio que dice no hay mal que por bien no venga, porque con el desplazamiento ella encontr\u00f3 la oportunidad de tener un mejor futuro en otra tierra, que  quiz\u00e1s no hubiera logrado en el lugar que la vio nacer. \n\nEn su negocio llamado \u201cConfecciones Angie\u201d, compra telas e insumos de bajo costo y elabora vestidos econ\u00f3micos, ella dice que con ello contribuye a aliviar la problem\u00e1tica de capacidad de compra que tienen las personas que viven en su barrio y sus alrededores, pues \u201csus clientes se sientan muy satisfechos al poder estrenar un vestido nuevo\u201d. \nSu primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, fue por valor de $1.500.000 que reembols\u00f3 estrictamente de acuerdo a su plan de amortizaci\u00f3n, pues lo invirti\u00f3 en mercanc\u00edas y variedades que le ayudaron a obtener una buena utilidad para poder adquirir nuevos electrodom\u00e9sticos y utensilios  para su hogar que aun no pose\u00eda; en la actualidad aplica a un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $2.000.000, que invertir\u00e1 en la compra de materia prima e insumos para la confecci\u00f3n de ropa, en comprar calzado y vestidos infantiles para surtir su vitrina y en adquirir una maquina de cocer nueva,  pues adem\u00e1s de confeccionar  tambi\u00e9n vende mercanc\u00eda en su barrio.\n\nSu m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es obtener una vivienda y un local para organizar y expandir su negocio logrando adquirir tecnolog\u00eda de punta  y  posicionarse en el mercado ofreciendo muchos puestos de trabajo y logrando dividendos que le ayuden al crecimiento humano, espiritual, profesional, de sus hijos y de sus futuros empleados. \n\nSu desafi\u00f3 actual es la falta de maquinaria adecuada para hacer un trabajo de mejor calidad  y recibir capacitaci\u00f3n y  en uni\u00f3n de su esposo y de su familia emprender el montaje  y desarrollo de una gran empresa de confecciones.\n\n","en":"Nora Elena Garc\u00eda B. is 33 years old and lives in the traditional neighborhood Olaya Herrera in Cartagena.  She is a native of the town of San Juan de Nepomuceno in the department of Bol\u00edvar, which at the this moment has been hit with insecurity, violence and forced displacement, requiring Nora to flee this conflict area 5 years ago to the city of Cartagena.  She fled along with her 3 children of 9,7,and 2 years and her husband, who works in the countryside since he could not find decent work in the city.  It was thus that she assumed the responsibility of supporting the household, practicing her trade as a seamstress that she learned when she was very young.  With the help of a generous couple who gave her a sewing machine she was able to start, with great enthusiasm, the business that she has today.  She hopes to see this business grow and help her family become more prosperous, and she directs all of her efforts toward these goals.  \n\nShe feels satisfied with her life, and gives thanks to God daily for being alive.  She reaffirms the saying that every cloud has a silver lining, because with the displacement she found the opportunity to have a better future in a different place, which perhaps she might not have had in the place where she was born.  In her business, called \"Confecciones Angie\" (Creations by Angie), she buys fabrics and supplies at low cost and makes economical dresses.  She says that with this business she helps alleviate the problem that people have in her neighborhood of not having enough money to buy new clothing, and says that \"her customers feel very satisfied being able to wear a new dress for the first time.\"  \n\nHer first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation was for $1,500, which she paid back strictly according to the established schedule.  She invested it in a variety of merchandise that helped her to obtain greater profits, which enabled her to acquire new household appliances and utensils that she did not yet have. She is now applying for a loan of $2,000 that she will use to buy raw materials and supplies to make clothing, to buy shoes and baby clothes to put on sale in her glass display case, and to acquire a new sewing machine, because in addition to making clothes she also sells merchandise in her neighborhood.  \n\nHer greatest dream is to have a home and a place to organize and expand her business, managing to acquire state-of-the-art technology and positioning herself in the market offering many jobs and generating profits to help the human, spiritual and professional growth of her children and future employees.  Her current challenge is that she lacks the adequate training and machinery to do work of the best quality and to start, along with her husband and his family, to set up and develop a large apparel company.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

For the past year she has worked with a friend raising and selling chickens. She says that the work is straightforward as they only have to provide what is necessary for the chickens to grow without difficulty and then, after one month, they sell them at a good price to their friends and acquaintances, who need them for food or to sell. She doesn't like that the chickens often become sick because they are quite delicate, but she is pleased that they grow quickly and so they can get regular income. She says that this business is quite profitable and the income enables her to help her husband with the household expenses. As she is an enterprising woman, in the future she plans to grow the business and for this she and her friend need to buy some land to increase the number of chickens they can keep and raise them in more space. This is the second loan that she has had from MFP, and she promises to make her repayments punctually so as to not disappoint all the people who have made the loan possible and are helping her to continue working. Graciela plans to use the loan to buy food and fatten-up the chickens, and so have them grow more quickly so they can sell them and generate good profits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":595111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":142.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":148.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":168.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":122.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":128.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154593},{"amount":52.03,"local_amount":138.75,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449905},{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":143.66,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":150.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588604},{"amount":55.33,"local_amount":147.53,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":154.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725109},{"amount":57.43,"local_amount":153.15,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":160.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463204},{"amount":69.89,"local_amount":186.37,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":195.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886609},{"amount":63.24,"local_amount":168.63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":176.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326944},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":139.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270325}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T10:01:14Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":232891,"name":"Rakel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rakel B. is from the village of Poblacion, Lantapan, Bukidnon.

Together with Julia, his wife of ten years, he cares for their children in their own home, which is located in the district of Acostambo. \"I have many goals to fulfill,\" he declares. \r\n\r\nAlthough he doesn't have the money necessary to buy his own agricultural land, he doesn't let this discourage him. Every day he puts more effort into his work, and saves what he can towards buying land. Already Cesar has seven years of experience growing potatoes, other tuber vegetables such as ulluco, oca, and mashua, barley, broad beans, and peas. He says that he rents plots of land from his community because it costs less and this way he also supports growth for its inhabitants. \r\n\r\nFor every harvest he takes advantage of his trips to the capital to sell his crops. He travels twice a week, bringing maca, peas and potatoes, which he sells at \"La parada\", the largest market in the country. \r\n\r\nAs he's a country man, he takes advantage of owning three horses and three donkeys and uses them as cargo animals to transport fertilizer to the fields. \"This way I get less tired,\" he explains. \r\n\r\nThis is Cesar's fifth loan with MFP, and is happy to know that he will have financial support and feels secure continuing with his work. Apart from anything else he promises to comply with his payments. Furthermore he appreciates being a part of his community bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nUpon receiving the funds, Cesar will invest the money requested in the purchase of natural fertilizers to spread on his crops, which include several varieties of potato such as yungay, canch\u00e1n, Andean and huario macho.

That was mainly thanks to her daughters, who advised her that she had already spent too much time doing physically demanding work in people's homes which could lead to long-term health problems. Carmina has supported her business and that of her husband through loans from EDAPROSPO for the past eight months. Both of them have pooled their incomes to cover the expenses of their home and their 14- and 11-year-old daughters. Together, they also make the monthly repayments on their loans. In the future, Carmina would like to expand her store into a mini-mart, specializing in soft drinks, beer and sweets, as these are the products she profits most from, and unlike groceries, they don't spoil. At any rate, before she invests much more in her business, she wants to invest in her daughters' education, and once they have completed their studies she will invest everything in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":280681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Invest part in her store, and the rest in her husband's recycling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":190,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.67,"local_amount":56.69,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":59.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084952},{"amount":40.32,"local_amount":38.31,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":40.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978432},{"amount":100.01,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-23T07:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439320}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T02:20:57Z","paid_date":"2009-06-23T07:39:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":96855,"name":"Jameda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jameda A. is married and has 6 dependents.

Safarali has been in the livestock business for many years. He supports his wife and four children. Since he began his business, he has worked hard to use his earnings to sustain his home. His livestock business has helped him to achieve his goals. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, Safarali needs to purchase more livestock in order to grow his business and improve the living conditions of his family. He is seeking a loan from IMON International in order to acquire additional animals to offer in the markets.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes \r\n\r\nand its rich history which includes its place as a key post \r\n\r\nalong the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the \r\n\r\nGreat's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, \r\n\r\nscientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), \r\n\r\nFirdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The \r\n\r\ncountry is home to communities that still speak the ancient \r\n\r\nSogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th \r\n\r\nmillennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the \r\n\r\nIslamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central \r\n\r\nAsian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A \r\n\r\ncivil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the \r\n\r\nU.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, \r\n\r\n93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is \r\n\r\narable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of \r\n\r\nunemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work \r\n\r\nin other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of \r\n\r\nTajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity \r\n\r\nand the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the \r\n\r\npopulation still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with \r\n\r\nKiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients \r\n\r\nrepresent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva \r\n\r\nhave already been distributed to thousands of IMON \r\n\r\nInternational's clients and will continue to provide thousands \r\n\r\nmore with permanent access to the varied financial services they \r\n\r\nneed.

There is also a stone face carved in a mountain by the Inca. It is a beautiful place that is always visited by local and international tourists. Our members are happy to have inherited the culture and traditions of the Inca, and they carry the honor and the pride of Inga Pirca in their daily lives.\r\n<p>\r\nThe communal bank \"La Inmaculada\" is formed by a group of 10 men and women, who are all ready to overcome and move forward little by little. We have some of their stories here.\r\n<p>\r\nEsther Yolanda L. P. is a member of the bank She lives in Inga Pirca, and is 22 years old. She has lived with a partner for one year. She has three children who are 6, 4, and 1 year old. Her first son is in the community school. They do not have their own home; they live in a house that a family member is lending them for a while. Her husband is a chauffeur, and supports her in everything. She says he is a pillar in her life.\r\n<p>\r\nEsther works as a domestic employee in the city center, and in the little time that she has at home, she raises chickens and guinea pigs.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan, and she is interested in the benefits she can receive as a member of the Espoir Foundation. With this loan she is going to start a chicken coop, so that she can stop working for other people and dedicate herself to her children and her business. Her dream is to have her own home.\r\n<p>\r\n Mariana de Jes\u00fas V. lives in the Santa B\u00e1rbara neighborhood in the Santa Ana parish, 40 minutes outside of Cuenca. She is 43 years old, and is the single mother of 5 children who are 22, 19, 14, 6, 3 months. The first two are not recognized by their father and have their own home. The younger three are recognized by their father, but he does not help them with anything. Her 14-year-old son often takes care of the house until Mariana comes home from work. They live in their own adobe house, which is an advantage.\r\n<p>\r\nMariana works as a domestic employee in the center of the city. She also raises chickens and guinea pigs, which she feeds before and after work.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan. She learned about the benefits and opportunities of the Espoir Foundation thanks to a friend who invited her to be part of the communal bank. With the loan, she will get a chicken hatchery so she can have her own business and improve the quality of life of her family, to help them move forward like she has been doing.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to have a brick house, so they can live comfortably without worrying about the winter, and give her children a better life.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha Adriana L. is another member of the bank. She lives in Inga Pirca, in a beautiful place in the Ca\u00f1ar area. She is 21 years old, and lives with her partner of five years, and they get along very well. She has two children, who are 3 and 1 and a half. Her husband works in construction, and they have their own home.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha is a domestic employee from Monday to Friday. On weekends she works on her business. She raises pigs, chickens, and guinea pigs, although her guinea pigs recently died. Now she is trying to recover from that loss. She also slaughtered a pig from her farm, and she sold the raw meat by the pound. She says that sales are good.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan, and she feels happy to have entered this little bank, because she knows the benefits that the foundation offers, and the members are friends in the community and are ready to overcome.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be invested in pigs for her farm.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to have a store, because there are few in her community, and to be able to only run her business so she can have more time to care for her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Iverson, Kiva

For two years he has been making these clothes for festivals that are popular in the towns in the outskirts of his region.  Sometimes he works with his father on special jobs.

Emelda dreams of securing the future of her family and lifting them out of poverty by giving her daughters an education, sending them to earn college degrees when they grow up. She is very optimistic that she will achieve this goal because her daughters excel in school - both earning first honors in the past year. <p>\r\n\r\nAt first, only her husband was engaged in selling \u201cBalut\u201d around their community, neighboring villages and the nearby towns, but even with his best efforts, his income could not provide for everything that the family needs. Since \"Balut\" is such a popular Filipino snack, Emelda knew that if she helped her husband and sold \"Balut\" in other places, she'd would earn an income, and this is what she did. When she was able to save enough, she put up a small general store adjacent to her house, but she also continued with her \"Balut\" vending.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen she needed fresh capital to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005. She reciprocates the support provided by NWTF-PD by paying back her weekly installments on time and paying the loan in full within the set loan term. Emelda has continuously maintained her good credit standing, and the loans she takes help her increase her income potential. Her present average monthly income is PHP 9,000, which enables her to save for her daughters' future education.<p>\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, her twelfth, she borrowed Php 10,000 as additional capital for her \u201cBalut\u201d business. Now that she has fully repaid that loan within its term, she plans to take another loan of PHP 13,000 for her 13th cycle loan which she plans to use to purchase additional inventory and working capital for her business. She intends to use the income from this loan to continue supporting the household expenses and the education of her daughters.<p>\r\n\r\nEmelda is shown in the picture posing inside her general store with some of the \"balut\" eggs.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women.

She is 49 years-old. Liza is the leader of a ten member group loan offered by Kiva partner ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLiza is widowed and has two adult children. Liza owns and operates a general store which sells both food and daily use products in the local community. Liza has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 500 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liza is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Liza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and North-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":464092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Sara used to work selling dresses, but now she spends her time taking care of her younger daughter.  She currently works selling food during the weekends, and makes different stews for her customers.  She has spent the past 7 years working in various businesses, which have always been profitable.  She enjoys cooking typical rural Peruvian food, which is why she would like to have her own restaurant in the future.  For this reason Sara would like to re-start selling shoes and dresses.

If this weren\u2019t enough, she also works attaching beadwork to articles of clothing.  In this job, she works with a middleman who leaves the items of clothing with her and then pays her when she delivers the finished products.  Since she\u2019s a very enterprising woman, she plans for later in the future to improve the set up in the videogames business in order to improve her profits.\r\n\r\nThis is her 7th loan with MFP and

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She earns her living by operating a business venture: buying and selling rice grain.  Her husband Erico C., who is 42 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 1 to 12 years old. \r\n\r\nEmelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as additional capital for the rice field so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of her business and more savings. Emelda C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

children. That is the basis of her motivation to work every day cultivating crops like wheat, onions and watermelon. She tends to her business with great care and dedication. Her husband and son help her with the business. They sell their products at the local market. \r\n\r\nSadat is one of the better sellers, but what keeps her back is her limited product range. In order to sell more, she needs to grow more on her land. This is the reason why Sadat is asking for a loan to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer. She expects that it will help her to increase her business, and above all it will give her the purchasing power to meet the needs of her family. Let's fund this self sacrificing mother's loan request and provide her a ray of hope.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She studied liberal arts in silkscreen printing and she worked two more years at a supply store and then at another store before she decided to become independent. She used her severance pay to purchase two second-hand cameras and with them she started with her nearest clientele: her parents and friends. Gradually she has managed to expand her territory, from the municipality of Soledad to the city of Barranquilla. For the past 3 years she has been involved with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and it was following a recommendation by her brother, a client enrolled with the organization for 10 years. With her loans she has managed to improve her infrastructure with the purchase of digital cameras, photographic materials, and better quality film. Her dream is to have a store equipped with all that a studio would need to leave a lasting impression on her clients, for the technology and for the beauty of her designs.

For this reason she is requesting a loan of $400.00, which she is committed to repaying in a period of 6 months, so she can make her wish into reality.  <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>Miriam y su esposo contribuyen con el ingreso familiar de manera muy ingeniosa y ahora s\u00f3lo cuentan con la compa\u00f1\u00eda de su hijo menor porque el mayor a adquirido obligaciones propias luego de constituir su propia familia.La habilidad que posee Miriam para relacionarse con muchas personas hizo que una de sus amigas le propusiera  la posibilidad de incursionar en la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos de una marca muy conocida y requerida en su pa\u00eds, se inform\u00f3 sobre los beneficios e incentivos que le otorgaba esta empresa y decidi\u00f3 formar parte de este negocio primero con su c\u00edrculo m\u00e1s \u00edntimo que poco a poco se fue abriendo e incorporando a muchas personas m\u00e1s ; la amabilidad y prestancia la convirti\u00f3 en una de las m\u00e1s solicitadas y gracias a este trabajo ha ido incrementando su nivel de vida familiar.La inquietud de Miriam radica en el incremento de su capital para adquirir mayor cantidad de productos para poder ofrec\u00e9rselos a cada una de sus clientas cuando lo necesitan y en el momento que lo requieran sin dificultad; por ello solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de  400  d\u00f3lares con el compromiso de retornarlos en un per\u00edodo de 6 meses para hacer de su deseo un hecho real."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":68080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a stock of cosmetics for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-09-26T05:05:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T15:57:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-10T10:21:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79528},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T10:24:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94805},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113335},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-02-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132823},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154860},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":179106}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T15:57:47Z","paid_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23136,"name":"Salma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salma M. is a 67-year-old mother of six who lives in Vituka in Dar Es Salaam city.

She and her husband both work very hard to sustain their family and to provide for the needs of their children. \r\n\r\nJudy started with only one piglet in their backyard. After that one, she tried raising more pigs and selling them directly to a buyer from Davao. She is asking for a loan from CEVI to purchase more piglets.

The loan that Manuel is seeking will be used to buy more clothing and eventually to obtain a stall from which it would be easier to sell their products.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":595235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Soyapango, departamento de San Salvador","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2010-09-04T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172064770},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177355720},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182490385},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188625173},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191368132},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-23T08:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196807670},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201227918},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-20T07:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206732774},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T07:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211388273},{"amount":480,"local_amount":480,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":480,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216448369}],"funded_date":"2010-09-19T17:16:40Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:32:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":232939,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena P. is from the village of Eastern, Wao, Lanao del Sur.

De adquirir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado tiene pensado comprar 4 mil plantas de caf\u00e9, con los que renovar\u00e1 sus plantaciones de caf\u00e9, y si el dinero le alcanza comprar\u00e1 sacos de abono org\u00e1nico.  \n\n","en":"\r\nDany, 18, lives with his father, Luis, 59, and his mother, Rosa, 45.  He loves and cares for them in their own house located in Sanchirio (Peruvian central jungle).\r\n\r\nThis enterprising young man has been farming for the last two years.  On his free time when he finishes with his studies he takes care of his parents\u2019 coffee plants.\r\n\r\nBut now, just a year ago he acquired four hectares of farmland where he was finally able to plant his own coffee and banana plants.  According to him, he sells bananas every two weeks at his local market but he sells the coffee crop to a cooperative in the city of Perene where coffee is amassed for processing.  Dany\u2019s wish, however, is to study the professional career of Agronomy that he hopes to use to help local farmers.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is grateful for the support from his communal bank where they gave him the strength to get ahead, above all the opportunity to be an independent, working man.\r\n\r\nIf he were to get the requested loan, he will use it to buy 4000 coffee plants with which to renew his coffee plantations. If there is money left over, he will use it to buy sacks of organic manure.\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":654142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 4000 coffee plants and sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dany ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":2200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2247.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850473}],"funded_date":"2010-12-04T19:44:58Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":257531,"name":"Begaiym's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Begaiym O., 40, is the leader of this group.

The six of them live in the community of Pumpuriani in their own home.\r\n\r\nPa\u00fal has five hectares of farmland.  On four of them he has planted coffee divided into two parts, one of which is ready to harvest in November, the other in April.\r\n\r\nPa\u00fal is a man who knows how to divide his land and his time.  \"There were hard days when the coffee didn't bear fruit and gave only 10-15 bags, and 70 bags was normal.  This happened because the land needed to be fertilized even more,\" he comments.  Because of this, later Pa\u00fal will buy other properties with good land, calculating that he will invest 15000 PEN.  He believes the decision is advisable because in that way he will save money buying fertilizer for a good time, and meanwhile continue working and saving.\r\n\r\nHe also hopes patiently that his children keep on growing, to teach them how to do agricultural work and help with the production.  For her part, Hida is available when he needs her, whether to clear the sown fields and harvest.  They don't neglect any aspect of their lives, since harmony and trust live in their home.\r\n\r\nPa\u00fal would be very happy if, through your help, he can continue devoting himself to his family and his land, since the loan would be his sixth with MFP.  \"I am happy about MFP because of the credit, and with my communal bank for the trust I find there.\"\r\n\r\nWith the money he will buy bags of fertilizer at 120 PEN each.  He needs seven bags per hectare, and will supplement with his savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":905206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-31T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2037,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400716}],"funded_date":"2011-11-01T19:57:29Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":355915,"name":"Helene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helene is 36 years, with 6 children who are between 3 and 14 years.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Nenita B.'s group.\r\n\r\nNenita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Nenita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Nenita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI which she has successfully repaid, this new loan of 20,000 PHP will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the ninth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Vergie has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately PHP 3,500 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vergie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vergie has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 13,000 from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Vergie is requesting a new loan of PHP 10,000 which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Vergie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This is a farming area located in the Piura province, Piura region, more than four hours from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nHe raises and sells sheep, keeping the animals in places located near his home, and feeding them with natural grasses.  When the sheep are well developed, he offers them for sale to traders who visit that area, and to his own neighbors.  He also farms, and has a small plot where he usually plants lemon.\r\n\r\nLuis wants to have more sheep and balanced feed to expand his business and bring in more money, and for this reason he has found it advantageous to request a loan of 1,000 new soles from Edpyme Alternativa.  Luis is a calm, reliable person.  Those who know him consider him to be hard-working and honest.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":642927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase sheep and balanced feed to expand his business (raising and selling sheep).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-11-21T02:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":68.85},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":70.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.53},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":95.53},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.3},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":68.85,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":72.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530782},{"amount":26.3,"local_amount":70.13,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":73.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666895},{"amount":28.25,"local_amount":75.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":79.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410217},{"amount":28.5,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":80.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108654},{"amount":30.32,"local_amount":80.84,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":85.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270795},{"amount":30.46,"local_amount":81.23,"processed_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":85.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137424},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":84.53,"processed_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":89.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211209944},{"amount":173.65,"local_amount":463.07,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:54:15Z","rounded_local_amount":487.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216488279}],"funded_date":"2010-11-26T11:25:40Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:54:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":253451,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica is a married lady with two children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
