The group members run small businesses selling clothing, plastic utensils, soap and charcoal. With the intention of growing their business funds, the group members decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their second group loan. Ms. Awa (the woman standing in the second place from the left to the right of the photo) is a major clothes saleswoman. She expects to use her loan to buy 25 wax pagnes (colorful wax cloths) at wholesale in Bamako. The resale will be made at retail in Kalaban-coura on foot, to a clientele made up largely of women. With this loan, Ms. Awa expects to have an average monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA which will be used to reinvest in the business and to meet the small needs of the household."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1723197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":96.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Toko          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":266666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":266666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":520.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":520.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":520.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":520.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1041.68,"local_amount":533333.34,"processed_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T15:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":537623.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579758602},{"amount":520.83,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":268811.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319203},{"amount":513.07,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-03T11:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":268811.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.76,"payment_id":610752959},{"amount":473.19,"local_amount":266666.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-30T09:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":268811.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":47.64,"payment_id":624542704},{"amount":479.35,"local_amount":266666.65,"processed_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-22T11:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":268811.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":41.48,"payment_id":636515726}],"funded_date":"2014-11-08T04:17:40Z","paid_date":"2015-04-22T11:03:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":793625,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet is 48 years old and married with four children.

Because of [the lack of] economic resources, she was not able to go to school and decided it was better to learn to work to help her parents economically. Then she decided to marry, and she and her life companion had 5 children, ages, 24, 21, 28, 30, and 13 years old. Three of her children are married, and so they depend on themselves, since they work for their own households. The other two still live with her, but only one is in school. The other already works to help his little mother with the expenses, since his father decided to leave them.\r\n\r\nAna tends a store in her house, but she also sells pupusas [a typical Salvadoran dish] in the afternoons in the public plaza in the community.

On the farm, he grows various crops and keeps dairy cattle and poultry. For the last six years, he has made money selling his farm's produce and engaging in other side businesses. He feels passionate about farming. However, his business is facing challenges such as the high cost of inputs and occasional drought. Julius is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. The upside, to Julius, of focusing more on his poultry business is that it is not very much affected by the major challenges he faces: the high cost of farm inputs and drought.

He is a husband to a lovely spouse, and they have been blessed with three children. Samwel has been doing mixed farming for 28 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, and other personal businesses. \r\n\r\nThe land in the Nyamira area is characterized by a rolling topography, not permitting the best cultivation practices to be followed. The only farming business that thrives is poultry farming. Samwel is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. There is so much growth opportunity in the chicken business in Kenya. The demand for poultry products is always high, especially during the festive seasons.

Elizabeth feels very grateful for her previous loan which had a positive impact on her business. She was able to increase her income and obtain new clients. With the desire to continue working and restock her business, Elizabeth is applying for a second loan to buy underwear, pants and blouses, all of which come in new styles since there is a lot of demand for it, most of all from her female clients.   \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a woman of hopes and dreams, one of which is to have a spot in the market where she can offer more of her merchandise in a more orderly fashion. For the moment however she will continue working from home until she obtains a greater profit. Elizabeth is placing her trust in this loan that will benefit both her and her family to increase their income and profits. She will continue working with Micredito via Kiva until she is able to be self sufficient. She will not stop dreaming and will continue to work hard for the wellbeing of her family.

The above picture presents to you a young, very ambitious small holder farmer who is only 25 years old. Geoffrey, based in Bosamaru, a very remote area in the Nyamira area of Kenya, is happily married and a proud father of two. \r\n\r\nBecause he lacked the finances, Geoffrey did not go to college. Instead, he has been engaged in mixed farming for the past four years, earning a decent and honest livelihood. He passionately loves poultry farming, and the Bosamaru area sees high demand for poultry meat and eggs, so farmers have been overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey never worries about competition because there is enough demand. Visionary and enterprising, Geoffrey has always wanted to increase his poultry numbers, but his biggest challenge is lack of funds. He is therefore seeking a loan to buy additional poultry, which will enable him to satisfy the demand for eggs in his village. This will lead to increased income and profit margins. \r\n\r\nThe poultry Geoffrey intends to buy are not ordinary poultry but rather breeds that have high productivity and high resistance to diseases. These breeds will assure him of an increased income level and hence improved living standards. He will also benefit from poultry manure, which has higher nitrogen levels than other livestock sources. \r\n\r\nGeoffrey\u2019s long term goal is to save more money and be able to start a large shop where he will be selling poultry meat, eggs and poultry feathers, which are used in making earrings. He also plans to save more money and go back to school; he will be taking care of poultry in the morning hours and attending evening classes."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1728112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T12:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T12:50:07Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":793681,"name":"Rosalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalyn is 35 years old, married, and has three children, two of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nRosalyn works hard to provide for her family.

Kenya, yet they constitute the majority of rural actors locked in socio-cultural structures that limit their agricultural productivity, efficiency and effectiveness at all points across the value chain. Key examples are entrenched inequities in access to productive land, limited access to credit, poor access to markets, and lack of extension services and agricultural technologies relevant to their needs. \r\n\r\nKiva lenders, the above picture presents Mary who started farming 14 years ago on a small inherited piece of land in Kiamwagi, a remote village in the Thika area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of three children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow which makes her very proud.\r\n\r\n Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan, she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and it protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Through the loan, she will also be able to buy a chaff cutter which is a mechanical device used in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage for better feeding of the cow. The chaff cutter also prevents the animals from rejecting any part of the food. Mary believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Jane, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early-riser and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nJane is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. Through the loan she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money to fully repay the loan and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":652.7,"image":{"id":1728147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4416.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4678.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4814.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4955.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5100.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5249.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5402.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5560.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5723.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5890.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6062.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.28,"local_amount":10365.95,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10407.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194600},{"amount":109.21,"local_amount":9735.07,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":9774.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262412},{"amount":107.61,"local_amount":9593,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9631.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600727},{"amount":157.16,"local_amount":14458.37,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":14516.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.03,"payment_id":681377575},{"amount":49.13,"local_amount":4686.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4705.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.45,"payment_id":711505578},{"amount":21.94,"local_amount":2050.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2059.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.07,"payment_id":731022400},{"amount":78.55,"local_amount":7294.04,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":7323.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.27,"payment_id":752110663}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T15:18:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peggy","image":1683516}},{"id":793715,"name":"Kavumbi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kavumbi is a married mother of nine kids and lives in Kaloleni.

She doesn\u2019t stand out in a crowd. She\u2019s not the first one to speak, nor the loudest. She sits down every day in the evening to catch the latest intrigue on her favorite local radio station, which provides maybe the only break in her day. \r\n\r\nJudith, who is a mother of two and based in the Nyamira area of Kenya, has been practicing mixed farming for the past 20 years. She sells milk, eggs, maize, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow. That makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy building, so she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy building. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is an institution that provides small holder farmers with a service bundle that includes credit, training and market facilitation, she believes her life will change. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding it. A good dairy building provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from contracting diseases that may arise from being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Judith believes that through this loan her living conditions will change, because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy building. \r\n\r\nJudith believes that ending poverty begins with empowering women so that they can control their own destiny"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":639.65,"image":{"id":1728188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to build a dairy cow building.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.91,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":111.91,"local_amount":9947.74,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10016.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194601},{"amount":105.08,"local_amount":9340.06,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":9404.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262414},{"amount":103.52,"local_amount":9201.36,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9264.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600729},{"amount":59.72,"local_amount":5478.15,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5515.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.91,"payment_id":681377577},{"amount":120.59,"local_amount":11473.09,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":11551.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.48,"payment_id":711505579},{"amount":59.36,"local_amount":5531.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5569.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.87,"payment_id":731022401},{"amount":63.56,"local_amount":5885.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5926.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.65,"payment_id":752110664}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T19:24:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peggy","image":1683516}},{"id":793738,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello there!

With the loan, she would be able to increase her milk productivity and also increase her income levels, hence reducing the poverty level that is currently facing her.

She studied up to Grade 6. She had to walk a long way to school and due to the economic situation at the time her parents refused to continue to support her studies. With the little that they made it was difficult to them to help all their children. She is married and her husband works as security. Together they have two daughters. One is 16 and is in her 2nd year of secondary school and the other is 15 and in her first year of secondary school.<br \/> <br \/>Claribel has a business selling basic food items. She says that when she married her husband was the only one working, as a security guard at this time. As she gained capital she decided to open a small business so she could also generate income. At first she had few items to offer her clients, but it was profitable. Little by little she gained experience and decide to go full-time with the business and today she has improved her financial situation. Previous to that she only did housework like washing, ironing and cooking. <br \/><br \/>Her business is located in her house. When she runs out of some product then she has to go out and find more to have to offer her clients. Her daughters and husband help her with the business. Normally she keeps her business open from 6 am until 7:30 pm.<br \/> <br \/>The loan that she is requesting is to compliment the money that she needs to buy a plot of land. The loan will be of great use as she can pay for the land at one time. Building on the land will make it more valid in providing for the future of her children. <br \/> <br \/>Claribel's dreams are to work hard and expand her business. And with the support of CrediCampo she will achieve this. Her daughters in a short time will graduate from their schools and enter university to study so that one day they can have greater economic income which will help sustain the finances of the family."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1722573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to supplement the money she needs to buy a plot of land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":68.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":66.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":69.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":73.73},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":76.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":88.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":90.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":93.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":95.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":98.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":101.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":114.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.14},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.41},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":793728,"name":"Hija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hija is a married woman with four children, all of whom attend school.

She was not able to continue going to school due to her family\u2019s financial situation.  She is in a relationship, and she has three children.  The first one, age 20, has a high school degree and is currently working.  The second one, age 17, is in the second year of high school.  The third one, age 13, is in the fourth grade.  Her husband works as a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nJaibi has been making pies, enchiladas, yucca, and soft drinks for four years.  When she was little she learned this from her mother.  Because she did not continue her schooling, there was nothing else to do other than learn this trade and help her mother in order to get her family ahead.  She has been going out and selling on the streets, especially when there is some community activity, ever since she can remember.  She also prepares for her sales by going to the soccer fields on Saturdays and Sundays.\r\n\r\nShe used to be a domestic employee in the city.  However, she decided to return home so that she would not neglect her children.  Her husband is involved by helping her buy the raw material.  Her oldest daughter helps to make the food.  On Saturdays and Sundays she sells almost always in the afternoons.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from CrediCampo is to buy three cases of yucca, one \u2018quintal\u2019 [100 pounds] of corn for the pies and enchiladas, five pounds of potatoes, 25 pounds of sugar for the soft drinks, and 300 bags to package the products.  The loan will help her to get better earnings with which she will be able to improve her family\u2019s financial condition.

She is very hardworking and focused. Her primary income sources today are milk, eggs, and tea, among other crops. \r\n\r\nMargaret is seeking a loan to purchase more poultry.

Meet Sabina. She lives in the Nyamira area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills carpeted in manicured tea plantations. Sabina is the mother of 4 lovely children and she has been in the agriculture business for 5 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea. \r\n\r\nSabina has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, the rising costs of farming inputs (such as for fertilizers) and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Sabina remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nSabina is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Sabina will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her will be timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of her work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better quality produce and more yields. \r\n\r\nThis loan will support Sabina\u2019s economic activity, and will change her family\u2019s living standards indirectly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1728262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.34,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.26,"local_amount":4993.33,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5213.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194605},{"amount":53.57,"local_amount":4591.58,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4794.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262422},{"amount":57.48,"local_amount":4926.77,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5144.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600736},{"amount":57.98,"local_amount":5129.55,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5356.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.86,"payment_id":681377584},{"amount":59.56,"local_amount":5464.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5705.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.19,"payment_id":711505584},{"amount":54.81,"local_amount":4894.42,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5110.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":752110667}],"funded_date":"2014-11-18T22:46:53Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zoe Benston","image":null}},{"id":793789,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ten years ago, Mary started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Bonyunyu, a remote village in the Nyamira area of Kenya.

However, when the patron festivities start in the month of September, it is incredible. The families get together to celebrate the Virgin of Sorrows and there are horse races, dances and fireworks that light up the sky. \r\n\r\nMartha is part of the group. She is 46 and has been married for 30 years. She has 7 children out of which only one lives with her still. \r\n\r\nShe breeds and fattens sheep. She has been doing this work for 30 years. She explains that it is difficult to find a person who will pay adequately for the weight and size of the sheep. Currently she has a flock of more than 30 sheep. In order to not spend so much on feed, she takes advantage of the field in the community so that the sheep can eat. \r\n\r\nEarly every morning, she takes out the sheep until noon. This way she does not need to buy feed which tend to be very expensive. Apart from the dry season when the fields loose their color and nutritional value. \r\n\r\nMartha plans to buy more sheep and to start saving money to prepare for the dry season which is approaching. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her home and to keep investing in herself now that her children are independent. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Natalia, Ang\u00e9lica and Rosa Mar\u00eda who will invest in their sheep, Juanita who will buy grocery supplies and Candelaria who will buy chickens. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*La foto fue tomada en el jard\u00edn del Municipio*\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1721488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep.

Her husband works for the construction employers. \r\n\r\nBecause of a high demand for consuming clean food, Huom is expanding her farming, especially animal husbandry, and she hopes that her business plan will help her increase the income for her family. For that reason, she has just taken out her 5th loan in the Anh Chi Em program to buy chicks and ducklings. Huom has worked at farm since she was a little girl, so she has rich experience in farming. She said the only difficulty she has encountered so far is lacking capital for investment, and the loans and the technical agricultural training sessions from the program have turned her plan into reality. \r\n\r\nDespite plenty of challenges and instability in agriculture, such as diseases and bad harvests, Huom is always smiling and optimistic, and looks forward to a brighter future for her family, especially for her children.

She has a sixth-grade level education. Due to the distance to her school, she did not continue with her studies. She also had to work for her own education because her family's financial situation did not allow for this. Her father invested what little he earned in food for the family. Therefore, she decided to leave school and help out by working to contribute to the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is in a common-law marriage. Her husband makes a living as a cobbler, making shoes to sell. They have two daughters, ages 20 and 22, both of whom are studying at university.\r\n\r\nVitalina is dedicated to the household duties. Since she couldn't continue studying, she started to work with the household chores, which is how she gained experience and practice in this activity. Now it is not difficult for her to care for her husband and children. Her husband has a cobbler shop in their house where he makes shoes to sell to other shoe shops. She helps out a lot with the orders and distribution to other shoe stores. Her daughter also helps her. She says that thanks to this business, they have managed to provide for their family by producing shoes and receiving orders from various stores. They have many orders and work until Sunday to fulfill the orders on time.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan from CREDICAMPO for her husband to buy materials for his cobbler shop, such as leather for shoes and rubber-soled shoes for bathing. Thanks to this loan, they will be able to maintain their shop and continue fulfilling the orders which they receive, thereby earning a financial income which will be a great help for their daughters' studies and the household expenses.\r\n\r\nVitalina, along with her husband, is planning to expand their shoe shop in the future and open a workshop where they can employ other people and distribute their shoes to prestigious stores. They will then earn a higher financial income to have a better quality of life, along with their children. They would like to buy land to build a house for their family. They also hope for their daughters to continue studying so that they can finish their professional studies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1722638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy leather for shoes and rubber-soled shoes for bathing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-08T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-08T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vitalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":73.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":74.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":86.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":89.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":92.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":103.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":164.5,"local_amount":164.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":164.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146062},{"amount":71.32,"local_amount":71.32,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":71.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769589},{"amount":80.82,"local_amount":80.82,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":80.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833212},{"amount":683.36,"local_amount":683.36,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":683.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636200979}],"funded_date":"2014-12-08T15:31:16Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":789866,"name":"Yessel Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yessel de 28 a\u00f1os de edad, alcanzo un estudio de 4\u00ba grado de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, actualmente est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada; sus esposo se dedica a la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda y son padres de una ni\u00f1a de un a\u00f1o de edad.\n\nYessel se dedica a la venta de tortillas tiene muchos a\u00f1os de ejercer este labor junto a su familia y hoy lo realiza para el consumo diario de su hogar.

Her oldest child, 9, is a third-grader; her middle child, 8, is a first-grader; and her youngest child, 3, isn't yet in school.  \r\n\r\nMarta operates a business raising and selling farm animals: pigs and poultry.  She says that her mother taught her how to raise farm animals and that she enjoys the challenge of caring for them.  She likes the work and when she needed a way to earn an income, an animal sales business was a logical choice for her.  \r\n\r\nMarta is applying for a loan that she will divide up to buy 4 pigs, a supply (\"2 quintales\") of feed and materials for building a small pen for her animals.  She says that the pen will make the animals more comfortable and ultimately more fit for market.

href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SM2xd2GyDH8&feature=youtu.be\">watch this video<\/a>\n\nIn the Pur\u00e9pecha language \u2018Shunhunda\u2019 means resin.  This is the name of a group of people who collect resin in the indigenous community of Cher\u00e1n.  This community is in the heart of the Tarasca mountains, the home of the Purepecha indigenous people in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico.\n\nJosu\u00e9 is the representative of this group, and he is also part of the advisory council.  Josu\u00e9 is married, and his wife works as a professional.  They have two children; Josu\u00e9 Felipe, age 13; and Julieta Jatsiri, age 2.  \n\nJosu\u00e9 points out that the resin collector is the primary forest ranger.  The business of collecting resin has directly impacted him his entire life.  This makes him feel very proud that he is teaching and making his countrymen aware of the sustainability of working the forest.\n\nHis plan for the future is for the indigenous community of Cher\u00e1n to have an industry where they can produce resin derivatives.  This has become one of his biggest dreams.  In other words, he wants to manage to have an industry in the community where the people know how to take advantage of it, value it, and manage the forest resources.  \n\nHe knows that there are people around the world who are ready to help the indigenous people in their forest project.  This makes his group feel committed to deliver good results.  He would like to say thanks for your effort to all of those that are helping the indigenous community.  They are getting out of a financial downturn and meeting the needs of the forest.\n\nIn addition to being a business, resin extraction has helped preserve the atmosphere in a positive and cultural way.  The trade of resin extraction is highly valued in the village. He feels that one of their biggest challenges is changing the way of looking at the business activity of extracting resin. \n\nAll group members will use their loans to plant resin producing pine trees.

On March 1 in 2006, due to the sadness she was feeling for a love lost, she moved to a different country to live. There she lives in a house with a woman who had a business selling beauty products such as makeup, lotion, nail polish, etc.  She decided to learn about this business and gained knowledge about the business and beauty product market. She initially began to the business from where she was living and when her business was growing she decided to return and launch the business again in her native Colombia.<br \/><br \/>Today she sells direct in Soledad municipality, both in cash and on credit, to clients that have small convenience stores. She works every day, from 8:30 in the morning until 8:00 PM at night.

Meet Rosemary, 54 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kigumo, a remote village in Thika. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last twenty years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Thika area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. \r\n\r\nLike many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing a tailoring business at home for many years with the help of her daughters. She wants to buy two additional sewing machines for her daughters, but she does not have enough cash in hand.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Bushra has requested a loan for her tailoring business so that she can easily buy sewing machines for her daughters.

Meet Lucy. She lives in the Thika area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills carpeted in manicured tea plantations. Lucy is a mother of four children and she has been in the agriculture business for 12 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea. \r\n\r\nLucy has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Lucy remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nLucy is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Lucy will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. \r\n\r\nAn increase in income for Lucy is timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize a better quality produce and more yields. This loan will support Lucy\u2019s economic activity and will change her family\u2019s living standards indirectly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1728618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-09T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-09T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":31325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262426}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T06:18:26Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":789897,"name":"Maria Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, mantiene en el mercado la venta de ropa, calzado, juguetes y otros productos, esto es posible por la buena administraci\u00f3n del pr\u00e9stamo que Kiva le facilito anteriormente para ir mejorando su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica, cuenta que hoy le da a su familia un mejor estilo de vida y pudo cancelar su deuda.\nComo ya se aproxima la temporada de mejores ventas y ve que no cuenta con la mercader\u00eda suficiente para complacer las demandas de sus clientes; Mar\u00eda se decidi\u00f3 por solicitar un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para comprar sandalias, zapatos, chancletas, ropa, etc., as\u00ed mantendr\u00e1 un buen inventario en su negocio. \n","en":"Mar\u00eda maintains a sale of clothing, shoes, toys and other products in the market.

Her partner provides transportation for the three children, the two oldest of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nFrancisca is independent, entrepreneurial, tenacious, trustworthy, and hardworking. She works in a market filled mostly with wholesale businesses with messy and dirty facilities. Men carry heavy bags full of goods, there are carts full of merchandise that go from one side of the market to the other, women who prepare fried foods at pushcarts amid trash containers, miscellaneous vendors, and shoe shiners waiting for customers, all making a confusing mix amid a dirty environment.   \r\n\r\nFrancisca is brown-skinned and of medium height, with long dark hair. Her native language is Quechua, but she uses Spanish for business (she is seated in the photo, wearing a white blouse). Her ambition to improve her situation led her to form a communal bank with other small business owners in order to apply for loans and help their businesses thrive. The other bank members run businesses such as mattress manufacturing, empanada sales, cosmetics sales, seasonal clothing sales, machine-knitted textiles, appliance repair, and furniture sales. Francisca's business is the manufacture and sale of bags for fruits and vegetables. She makes the bags herself from soft and flexible diamond mesh material which can hold delicate produce without bruising it but is also strong enough to carry and protect various loads. The open mesh design provides greater transparency and visibility of the produce in the bag.    \r\n\r\nThis is the first time Francisca has applied for a loan in the ten years she's been running her business. She hopes to sell her bags wholesale at many more markets, expanding her business through the purchase of an industrial machine with the proceeds of this loan.

Meet Mondester, who is 41 years old, and is very hardworking, honest and humble. She hails from Nyamira, Kenya - an area that is blessed with elite and world renowned runners, and also the best weather patterns that favor farming activities. \r\n\r\nMondester is a proud mother of four children that she really loves and adores and will do anything in her power to always give them the best. She has been farming for the past 10 years, and through these years she has always provided them with all the basic needs that they require. \r\n\r\nMondester practices mixed farming - that is crop and animal farming, and through these two she has been able to support her family, but she still faces challenges, which is why she wants to diversify and start poultry farming so that she can make ends meet. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy poultry, and she believes that through the increased income she will be able to comfortably take care of her family and assure her grandchildren of a secure future. Mondester has experienced difficulties in acquiring funds to start her poultry business, but she now feels relieved knowing that Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and other lenders to support aspiring women like her to be economically empowered and be able to realize their dreams. \r\n\r\nBecause of the many years that Mondester has had in farming, she has learned the culture of saving and being honest with money, and she hopes through the loan she will be able to save more and repay the loan on time. She believes that the loan will assist her to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her grandchildren."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":208.37,"image":{"id":1728639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-09T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-09T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mondester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.3,"local_amount":3315.91,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3338.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194609},{"amount":35.03,"local_amount":3113.36,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3134.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262428},{"amount":34.51,"local_amount":3067.12,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3088.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600740},{"amount":38.94,"local_amount":3572.45,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3597.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.25,"payment_id":681377588},{"amount":37.69,"local_amount":3585.83,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3610.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.65,"payment_id":711505588},{"amount":20.16,"local_amount":1866.39,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1879.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.84,"payment_id":752110670}],"funded_date":"2014-11-13T01:34:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":789909,"name":"Edgar Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edgar de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado y tiene 2 hijas de 10 y 3 a\u00f1os de edad, su pareja reside en el extranjero con sus hijas y regresa al pa\u00eds una vez al a\u00f1o. \u00c9l vive solo.\n\nEdgar es comerciante, trabaja con su madre en un comedor que ella inicio hace ocho a\u00f1os, \u00e9l se regres\u00f3 del extranjero hace 2 a\u00f1os para ayudar a su madre con el negocio.

She is a hardworking and brave mother, who is helping her family by providing tailoring services in her community. Being a mother, she wants to provide better facilities for her children, and this is the reason for her working extremely hard - to keep her children smiling.\r\n\r\nShe started sewing clothes after the birth of her three children, when she observed that her husband couldn't provide everything necessary for them. She decided to start tailoring work at home, and since then, she has been sewing clothes for her community. Because she wants to enhance the beauty of her craft, she would like to buy a Juki sewing machine. The professionals use this machine for tailoring because of its speed and fine performance.\r\n\r\nShe knows the techniques of tailoring very well. Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives, and the local community. She has requested a loan to buy a new Juki sewing machine and some packs of zippers and buttons to meet the increasing demand. \r\n\r\nJamila is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC

She carries out her business in a market in the \"Plan 3000\" zone, a location characterized by disorder and dirtiness, where the vendors even settle themselves on the sidewalk to sell their products. Traffic is a daily bottleneck, and the level of policing is very low for the amount of commerce that exists there.\r\n\r\nGabina is of dark complexion, medium stature, and long braided gay hair. Her form of dress is traditions (shawl, skirt, and hat). Her maternal language is Quechua, and she speaks Spanish for business. In the photo, she is in the center in the back, standing, in a white blouse with lilac flowers). She lives with her husband, who works in construction, and her children, who finished secondary school and work. Because of her desire to get ahead, she formed a bank with people who have businesses such as a video store, selling clothing, selling sandwiches, handicrafts in plaster, selling soft drinks, a bookstore, and selling cosmetic products, so that they could apply for a loan and prosper in their businesses.  Her business is a stand for selling fruit at a fixed location inside the market. Her customers are regular, and the fruit that she sells is fresh and delicious.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a sales stall in a new market under construction in the zone, because her market is old and makeshift and doesn't have good hygiene.

The location where the members meet is surrounded by mountains and sugar cane plantations. In the harvest season, when the cane is cut, the members\u2019 neighborhood can be seen, but when the cane is high, the houses are hidden. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group face life day-by-day in different ways, seeking the wellbeing of their families. Each one of them decided to learn an occupation that yields earnings to help them. \r\n\r\nNoel is married to Guadalupe, with whom he has had three children, who are his primary motivation to start his own business. He notes that first he worked in a bakery in the town, and that it was there that he learned, through practice, everything he knows about the occupation. However, when he saw that his boss was making a lot of earnings, he decided to become independent. \r\n\r\nIt has now been six years since Noel established his own bakery and he counts on the help of his wife and 6 more employees who help him deliver the bread. The number of employees increases in the cold season, when customers want more bread to go with hot beverages. Noel cooks the bread in a stone oven that uses firewood as its principal fuel. Noel usually looks for this material himself in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nWith the earnings he has obtained, Noel has had the opportunity to improve his business little by little, to remodel his home, and to cover his children\u2019s educational expenses. With the loan, Noel will buy the ingredients that he uses the most in his occupation: flour, icing sugar, butter, sugar, food coloring, cheese, and a rolling pin. Noel needs to stock up, since the winter season is starting to come closer. Also, in just a week it is the week of the traditional Mexican celebration of the Day of the Dead, in which it is very common to buy bread for consumption and to decorate the altars that are prepared for the deceased.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members and their occupations are:\r\nRosalba \u2013 Sale of hamburgers and hot dogs\r\nPaula \u2013 Sale of snacks\r\nMarco \u2013 Sale of snacks\r\nRoberto \u2013 Sale of chicken\r\nGuadalupe \u2013 Sale of clothes, tamales, and stuffed chilies\r\nMaria \u2013 Sale of Jafra cosmetics\r\nIsabel \u2013 Sale of chicken\r\nJesus- -

Meet Jane, a 44-year-old farmer from a remote village in the Kemera, Nyamira area. She resides with her husband with whom she has been blessed with five lovely children. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 25 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells tea, milk, eggs and various varieties of food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs.<br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry, sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure. which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that would have been spent in buying fertilizer.

Guadalupe son mujeres que viven en una comunidad mazahua y a\u00fan  conservan su lengua materna, sus tradiciones, sus fiestas, etc. Ellas se conocen desde que eran ni\u00f1as y el lazo de amistad que las une es algo que tambi\u00e9n las distingue. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque la mayor\u00eda se dedica a trabajar en el campo, en sus terrenos cultivan ma\u00edz, frijoles, habas, calabazas, los cuales sirven como alimento durante todo el a\u00f1o para sus familias. Adem\u00e1s, esta actividad les permite a todas ellas ayudar a sus esposos quienes trabajan como obreros. \n\nFrancisca, Epifania, Gregoria, Mar\u00eda, Ma Guadalupe y Cleotilde tambi\u00e9n cr\u00edan borregos, pollos y pavos para tener un ingreso extra. Sin embargo, la inquietud y curiosidad de Guadalupe la han impulsado a iniciar una tercera acctividad: la venta de dulces. \n\nPaula, por otro lado, tiene una actividad distinta al resto de sus amigas: elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00edas bordadas. \u201cMe encanta lo que mi mam\u00e1 y mi abuela me ense\u00f1aron desde ni\u00f1a, para m\u00ed es algo muy preciado pero sobretodo porque as\u00ed puedo ayudar a mi esposo con los gastos del hogar\u201d. Paula es casada y tiene tres hijos que ya no dependen de la pareja. \n\nDesde muy peque\u00f1a, Paula observaba a su mam\u00e1 y su abuelita cuando bordaban sus servilletas, manteles y labradas (adorno de la t\u00edpica falda mazahua que visten las mujeres de su comunidad). Paula debe comprar materia prima como hilos, agujas y tela cuadrille pues tiene que estar lista para los siguientes meses en los cuales sus ventas aumentan. A pesar de que sus hijos ya son independientes, Paula a\u00fan sue\u00f1a con hacer algunas mejoras a su casa para que ella y su esposo puedan vivir mejor. \n\n*La foto fue tomada en el jard\u00edn municipal, el cual es el lugar m\u00e1s concurrido por los habitantes de este lugar*","en":"Francisca, Paula, Epifania, Gregoria, Maria, Ma Guadalupe, Cleotilde y Guadalupe who live in a Mazahua community where they still maintain their native language, traditions, festivals, etc.  They've known each other since childhood, and the bond of friendship that unites them is also something that distinguishes them.  The name of this group was chosen because most of them work in the fields, in land where they cultivate corn, beans, and squash which are used to feed their families throughout the year.  Also, this activity allows each of them to help their husbands, who work as laborers.\r\n\r\nFrancisca, Epifania, Gregoria, Mar\u00eda, Ma Guadalupe and Cleotilde also raise sheep, chicken and turkeys for extra income.  However, the restlessness and curiosity of Guadalupe have led her to start up a third business selling sweets.\r\n\r\nPaula, on the other hand, has a business that is different from the rest.  She works making embroidered crafts. \"I love that my Mom and my Grandmother taught me to do this as a child, for me it is something precious, most of all  because I can help my husband with the household expenses.\" Paula is married and has 3 children who no longer depend upon her and her husband.\r\n\r\nEver since she was very young, Paula used to watch her mother and grandmother when they were embroidering napkins, tablecloths and \"labradas,\" (a Mazahua typical motif skirt worn by the women in their community).  Paula needs a loan to buy raw materials such as thread, needles, and gingham fabric because she needs to be ready for the upcoming months when her sales will increase.  Even though her children are already grown, Paula dreams of making some improvements to her home so that she and her husband can live better.\r\n\r\nThe photo above was taken in the municipal garden, which is the main gathering place for the people who live in this area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5325,"image":{"id":1722540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for her embroidery business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dios Padre, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-11-09T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-09T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":5325,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.13,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4137.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4183.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4229.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4276.73},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4324.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4372.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4420.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4469.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4519.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4569.13},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4619.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4670.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4722.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4775.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4828.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4881.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":319.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":326.93},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":330.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":349.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":353.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1625.7,"local_amount":21981.23,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":22056.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579807784},{"amount":1933.69,"local_amount":26145.73,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":26234.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349881},{"amount":1405.12,"local_amount":18998.84,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":19063.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980595},{"amount":347.36,"local_amount":4874.2,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.13,"payment_id":624423750}],"funded_date":"2014-11-09T19:58:44Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":794051,"name":"Maribeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribeth is 42 years old and married with two children.

She is positive that this will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source for meeting their daily expenses and sending her children to school. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.<br \/><br \/>Monica hopes to maintain and grow her business so they could have a better life.

She owns a small piece of land where she lives with her three children. For the last 10 years, she has been growing maize on the piece of land. She has managed to make a living selling the maize grains to millers after the harvest. She is also involved in other small personal businesses to make extra money. Recently, Caroline started keeping poultry for fun. She liked the fact that she could wake up in the morning and collect eggs for her family's breakfast. She started looking at poultry as a business when she had more hens and surplus eggs for breakfast. She started selling eggs to neighbors. More neighbors kept coming and wanting more and more every day. Caroline seeks a loan to purchase poultry. She can hardly meet today's demands. Her major challenge is raising funds.

He has two children who are currently in school.  He catches and sells fresh fish to provide for the everyday needs and expenditures of the family.\r\n\r\nFishing is one of the common sources of income in Palawan since most of the folks are living near seashore lines. Among them is Romeo. First thing in the morning, he prepares his boat, fishing tools and accessories like nets, rod holders, bait prep and tanks, grippers, knives and more. After hours of bearing the scorching heat of the sun, he  goes back to the shore with other fishermen with their nets full of tons of fresh-caught fish. Coron island offers some of the freshest fish in the Philippines. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nRomeo is now requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to buy a fish net and a new engine for his boat. His boat has to be efficient and safe so he can fish in a deeper part of the sea. He is thanking God and you in advance for the increased earnings and the financial help that will be given him. His income from fishing helps cover their everyday needs and for the schooling of his kids.\r\n\r\nHe aims to have more boats in the future to improve his fishing business. He prays for his safety and guidance to give his children a much better life. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Microfinance

Meet Gladys, 37 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer who is based in Kebirigo, a remote village in Nyamira. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. Gladys is happily married and blessed with four children. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Nyamira area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business.

30, is a housewife who practices small-scale dairy farming in Tinga village in the Nyanza province of Kenya. Truphena is active when it comes to commercial activities. She is a pragmatic problem solver. Her distinguishing factor is that she adds a business angle to every cultural way of life. While her community keeps cattle and poultry for food, she does the same on a greater scale in order to sell the surplus. Truphena is seeking a loan to purchase a brood of hens. She will use the same technique she used to grow her dairy farm to grow her poultry farm. The flock of hens will lay eggs, half of which will be sold and the rest kept for hatching and family consumption.
