Meet Mary, a very hardworking mother who is 36 years of age. She is a small-holder farmer from Magumoni, a remote village in the fertile Nyamira area of Kenya. This charming mother of three has been engaged in mixed farming for the past 15 years. She commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in her village. Her main source of income has been eggs, tea, milk,  and a variety of food crops that she plants. \r\n\r\nTaking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Nyamira. Mary has a good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of that ready market. However, the demand is very high. Being a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nAccessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Mary will achieve their dreams and goals. Mary believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":115.83,"image":{"id":1728758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-09T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-09T13:40:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.61,"local_amount":1649.12,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194617},{"amount":95.22,"local_amount":7617.61,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8522.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262435}],"funded_date":"2014-11-09T17:44:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":790416,"name":"Isidro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Isidro de 56 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado de profesi\u00f3n Marinero.

She is an enterprising woman who received a proposition from her ex-mother-in-law that they open a store selling miscellany (stationary, toys, etc) and decided to accept, and this is how her business came into being. \r\nThe store is very busy with the inhabitants of their neighborhood in the town of Soledad. Her customers can find at their fingertips all types of stationary, decorations, skin- and hair-care products, and other things. They began the business in 2013 and they needed a loan to have working capital for this family business. Merys, in her role as a single mother, wants to give her 3 year old boy a good education. Her son is her main motivation and she works very hard to get the resources she needs to care for him: 12 hours a day from Monday to Sunday. \r\nOne of her business strategies is the ease of paying that she offers to her customers. Likewise, the business is trusted by its suppliers that provide merchandise on credit and she pays cash which means that she gets discounts and can pass these on to her customers as prices that match their means. \r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy stationary and toys.

This is how she learned the job and continued doing it independently two years ago. At the same time, she was working in a project training young people. However, the project finished and nowadays she only works in the cafe, which is 15 minutes from her house. She walks there and her schedule is from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.  She is requesting the loan to buy a calved cow they are offering her, a good opportunity because it is from good breed and she is getting it at a good price. The rest of the loan she will use to buy merchandise for her cafe: churros, cookies and sweets, and also the ingredients for the pupusas (stuffed tortillas) she makes for the students. She will also buy six boxes of sodas that she needs for graduation, because the school year is about to finish. Clara dreams of having more sales in her cafe next year, and that little by little she can invest more her earnings; and that with those plus the earnings from the cow, she will keep helping her husband with household expenses so that their son can study well and become professional. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1723469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a calved cow, churros, cookies and sweets, and also the ingredients for the pupusas (stuffed tortillas) she makes for the students, as well as 6 boxes of sodas.

She sells footwear, pants, and also earns income by offering hair care services and capillary treatments.    At this time of year when the Christmas and New Year festivals approach, her sales increase, as much of merchandise as of services to improve personal image.   Families have more money because of the effect of the finances of this time period, and they also spend much more.\r\n\r\nLisbeth takes advantage of this to stock more for business and be ready to work in the hair salon, extending her hours.  Lisbeth remembers that when she was studying in a beauty school three years ago, she was learning to work in her mother's business. Her mother worked at selling various items, until the point in time when she became ill and Lisbeth had to take over the business, adding services to enhance personal appearance, in order to use the knowledge she gained while attending school.   \r\n\r\nThings have gone well for her with this business and she carries out sales for cash and on credit directly to the final consumer.  Her customers are mostly teachers from the area, and neighbors, as well as customers referred by them.   Lisbeth's goal looking ahead is to have a storehouse of clothing, in order to earn more and help her family.

Meet Stella, 39 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Kemera, a remote village in Nyamira. She is happily married and is blessed with one adorable child. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her child, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Nyamira area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 10,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going

Meet Sally, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandihills area of Kenya. Sally, 55, has been farming for the past 10 years. \r\n\r\nThrough those years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Sally is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. \r\n\r\nThat is why, every day she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. She is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \r\n\r\nKenya's Nandihills area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Sally could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there.

She plans to use her loan to buy two boxes of soap, four packets of matches, and 25 brushes.

Meet Leah, a very industrious, honest and hard-working woman from the Kericho area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley. \r\n\r\nLeah has been farming for the past 15 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practising mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Leah is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. \r\n\r\nAlthough Leah makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kericho area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Leah could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Leah, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Leah believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. \r\n\r\nIncreased profits will allow Leah to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1728797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural

","en":"Zhypargul is 43 years old, married and the mother of three children. She has vocational education. She has had her own livestock breeding business for many years already. Currently Zhypargul has five cows and 15 sheep on her farm, and she grows clover on a plot of land of 1.5 hectares. Zhypargul's total monthly income is on average 20,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nZhypargul's husband and children actively help her with the business.

Meet Selina, a 73-year-old, very hard working, honest and ever-smiling mother. She lives with her husband in the lush hills of Kitale, in the rift valley region of Kenya. Selina passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past 28 years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nSelina has identified a free space in her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and milk prices in the recent past have been going up. Selina, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she has learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nSelina said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Selina hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her 10 children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1728950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is requesting a new loan in order to purchase a variety of threads in many colors and textures.  These threads will help her grow her business.

which in July 2013 received loans through Kiva. These women have been very active and very responsibly have paid back their loans. The group is currently seeking new loans in order to invest in their micro-businesses. The businesses consist of the manufacture and sale of textiles, cosmetics sales, medical sales and food sales, as well as other businesses.\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Evelia, who is 30 years old and the single mother of three children, two of whom are in school. Evelia\u2019s business is the sale of parts. Four months ago, she was able to buy a small coffee shop. The coffee shop has had so many customers that she is encouraged to apply for a new loan so she can buy and prepare new food items, drinks and \u201catole\u201d (a hot corn and masa (dough)-based beverage) which will make her menu more diverse. The new menu items will also help her to continue to expand her clientele. \r\n\r\nThe women of the Utatlan Trust Bank report that they are eager to enter into a new loan cycle. They are also looking forward to receiving the non-formal educational training that helps them to increase their intellectual development. These training sessions are provided at the monthly Trust Bank meetings by the Trust Bank officer are part of Friendship Bridge\u2019s \u201cMicro-credit Plus\u201d program of subjects such as business management, customer service and accounting \u2013 all of which are very important for the success of their businesses. They are all very grateful to the Kiva investors who have helped them become

She is married to Franklin, her business partner, and she has children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCarina operates a bakery. Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine, and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish pan de sal, or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students, and workers. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 45,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy raw supplies such as flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarina dreams to have a bigger bakery and hopes that her children will have a good future. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1729258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nSalome dreams to grow and expand her business.

of four. Aishakan has received secondary education. Since 2000 she has been raising livestock and growing farm produce. Thanks to Aishakan's hard work, she has six cows at her farm at present. She also has 0.7 [2.5 acres] of irrigated land, where she grows watermelons, cotton and corn for own consumption as well as for sale. Aishakan's ecologically grown and delicious produce is in high demand and brings in a monthly income of approximately 22,000 KGS.

The above picture presents Metrine, a mother of four who has been practicing agriculture for the last 10 years. Because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect among other farmers and she is viewed as a mentor in her village. She lives together with her children in the Kitale area of Kenya, which is known for maize plantations for export. Metrine's primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Generating an income through selling her harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. She also keeps a dairy cow. Availability of labor is a major challenge for Metrine.\r\n\r\nBefore joining Juhudi, Metrine could not access loans from banks since they considered her a high risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the group Excel Senior. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learned about loan management and agribusiness. She also got to learn about Kiva. Metrine is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. With your loan, Metrine will purchase more effective modern tools that will make her farm activities much easier. This will boost her income and enable her to pay school fees for her children. Metrine waits for your

This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community, where the store is just connected to, or just inside, their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg and other items. She gets her product from a wholesaler at a lower price then she will sell it per piece for a higher price to have profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby and the people in the community. She earns PHP 500 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nJocelyn desires that her business will continue to grow and she is hoping to give her children all their needs, particularly in their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

money to provide financial support for her family. Though her responsibilities are critical to her family\u2019s well-being, this is considered a mere duty in Kenya, a job with little appreciation. Florence husband, Victor, manages their small farm making $100 per year. Even though his small income keeps the family living in poverty, he still claims the position of breadwinner in the household, as is the case in most households in Kenya.\r\n\r\nFinancial support far outweighs any other care or support for the family, leaving women disadvantaged to make decisions within the household, and forces them to fully depend on their husbands to buy everything, from laundry soap to the food they eat. Until this cultural dogma shifts, it is critical that women have opportunities to participate in money-making activities. \r\n\r\nWith the little time Florence has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. From Kiva lenders, Florence is seeking a loan worth 120,000 KES to grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Florence access to a loan facility that will aid her to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Florence\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1729383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To grow her horticulture business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-10T04:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-10T04:50:04Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":8492.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":8740.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":8996.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9259.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9529.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9808.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10095.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10390.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10693.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":11006.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":11327.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":11659.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.57},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":209.22,"local_amount":18597.54,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":18725.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194627},{"amount":210.47,"local_amount":18708.44,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":18837.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262445},{"amount":226.3,"local_amount":20115.71,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":20254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600754},{"amount":106.89,"local_amount":9805.38,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9872.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.42,"payment_id":681377604},{"amount":107.11,"local_amount":9892.2,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":9960.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.18,"payment_id":696587309},{"amount":240.33,"local_amount":22864.54,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":23021.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.9,"payment_id":711505602},{"amount":216.17,"local_amount":20016.19,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20153.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.01,"payment_id":752110682}],"funded_date":"2014-11-20T14:58:17Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peggy","image":1683516}},{"id":794610,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a 29-year-old married woman and a mother of a five-month-old child.

To fund this project, she needs additional capital to purchase 100 kilos of bananas for wholesale, so she has requested a loan from Paglaum-MPC.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1729415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 100 kilos of bananas for wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2014-11-10T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-10T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evangeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1490},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1490}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T11:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595783749},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610686460},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T11:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624951852},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636437778},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649705983},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":668180306},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681501248},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696707649},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T17:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711639610},{"amount":35,"local_amount":1490,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1572.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731144752}],"funded_date":"2014-11-12T04:21:57Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T16:40:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":794632,"name":"Yasmeen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yasmeen is a responsible mother of two daughters.

Meet Ruth. She is a 30-year-old farmer from Kapomboi village, situated in the Kitale area of Kenya. She lives together with her husband and four children on a small piece of land where she keeps poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. For ten years, her primary sources of income have been eggs and horticultural produce. Her biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. Ruth made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. Some time last month, she applied for a loan for expanding her horticulture farm. This will enable her to expand her operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to her children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, Ruth\u2019s children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":444.73,"image":{"id":1729436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

","en":"Since 2010, Melquecidez, 41, has been making sandals and women's shoes in general.  He decided on this trade after taking a technical course in women's shoes at a national insitute specializing in technical and technological training (SENA).  He also learned about starting his own business with the knowledge he had acquired.  His main customers are wholesale merchants for whom he works based on measurements.\r\n\r\nMelquecidez sells on credit and on a cash basis.  Througout the year he works from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. and buys raw materials in specialist shops so he can pay less and be more competitive.  His goal for the future is to buy machinery and generate employment.  This is so he can broaden his market and earn more profit in order to renovate his house in the future.\r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is to increase production and attract new customers.  He is requesting a CrediKiva loan, his first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to buy raw materials such as as soles, synthetic materials, glue and accessories.  This investment will increase his sales volume through new designs for the busiest season of the year in December: Christmas and New Year's.  During this wonderful time of year everyone wants new shoes to feel more elegant and happy alongside their families, celebrating the birth of Jesus and saying goodbye to 2014."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1723596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

This is Gladys. She is the Head teacher of Rock of Joy Nursery & Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Lungujja in Kampala district with 384 students. Rock of Joy Nursery & Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.
