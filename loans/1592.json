Temilda, trabajando diariamente desde las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta la 1 de la tarde, en su negocio ubicado al sur de la ciudad, donde habita con sus dos hijos de 16 y 21 a\u00f1os. Este negocio inici\u00f3 hace 6 a\u00f1os, aunque antes pertenecia a sus padres, quienes habian logrado su posicionamiento. Cuando el padre de Temilda  falleci\u00f3, ella, su hermana y su madre, continuaron vendiendo cariba\u00f1olas, bollos limpios, arepas, empanadas  en las horas de la ma\u00f1ana y al medio dia, empezaron a vender almuerzos.  Sus ventas las realiza de contado, a clientes ubicados  en su propio barrio,  a profesores, estudiantes de colegios vecinos y en tambien cuentan con clientes de los barrios que la circundan. Temilda siempre est\u00e1 pendiente de los eventos que ocurren a su alrededor, por eso ella es a quien primero avisan, porque logra captar la atenci\u00f3n y la accion de compra para el desarrollo de eventos y actividades festivas y tambien tiene acceso f\u00e1cil a los vendedores del centro de la ciudad  y especialmente a los del parque cultural de Barranquilla, quienes le compran constantemente.  Su meta es ampliar su negocio e incrementar el volumen de ventas, para aumentar la calidad de vida de su familia. En la actualidad Temilda est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financimeinto que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 materiales constructivos, con los cuales planea hacer adecuaciones a su patio, ampliando la posibilidad de incrementar su capacidad de atenci\u00f3n al cliente, lugar que har\u00e1 mejoras y ofrecer\u00e1 como un sitio mucho mas confortable, mejorando as\u00ed su presentaci\u00f3n y el incremento de sus ventas, que es a lo que finalmente le apunta Temilda.","en":"Lunches, \u201cfrituras\u201d [fritters], cakes, and \u201chayacas\u201d [beef, pork or chicken, and vegetables wrapped in cornmeal dough] are the main products that Temilda makes.  She works daily from 4:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the afternoon.  Her business is located south of the city where she lives with her children, ages 16 and 21.  She started this business six years ago, although previously it belonged to her parents, who strived to achieve its market position.  When Temilda\u2019s father died, she, her sister, and her mother continued selling \u201ccarima\u00f1olas\u201d [meat-stuffed fried yucca root], \u201cbollos limpios\u201d [white, dry corn wrapped in corn cob leaves and boiled or blanched], \u201carepas\u201d [corn pancakes], \u201cempanadas\u201d [pastries filled with chopped or ground meat, vegetables, fruit, etc., and usually baked or fried] in the morning and began selling lunches at midday.  She makes her sales in cash, and sells to customers in her own neighborhood, teachers, school students, neighbors, and also has customers from the surrounding neighborhoods.  \r\n\r\nTemilda is always aware of the events that are happening around her. People let her know first because she manages to draw the attention, and desire to buy during the development of events and festivals.  She also has easy access to the downtown vendors, especially those in the Barranquilla cultural park, who make purchases regularly.  Her goal is to expand her business and increase sales volume and thereby improve her family\u2019s quality of life.   Currently, Temilda is applying for a Kiva loan, her first with \u201cFundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\u201d.  She will use the funds to purchase construction materials, with which she plans to make adaptions to her patio, making it possible to serve more customers.  The improvements she will make to the place will permit her to offer a much more comfortable space, thus improving its appearance and increasing her sales, which is Temilda\u2019s ultimate goal.  ."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1722698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase construction materials to adapt her busines location.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-11-10T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-10T13:40:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Temilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75110},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115163},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":118618},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":122177},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125842},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":129617},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133506},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137511},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":141636},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145885},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150262},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":154770},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":159413},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":164195},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":226295}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":794684,"name":"Julius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julius is a married man who has three children.

high dropout rates, chronic childhood malnutrition, and limited female participation in education and civil society. KVS\u2019s ability to provide basic services is compromised by inefficient, expensive energy that is environmentally harmful. The loan will be used to install a 4kW solar energy system.\n\nMaggie, an American student and volunteer, initially founded the school as an orphanage in 2006. Today KVS offers nursery to grade 9 schooling for more than 350 students, and is home to 44 children. (Children in the photos are the adopted children of the Kopila Valley Children's Home, and students from the surrounding villages who attend the Kopila Valley School.) In addition to offering some of the most innovative curriculum in the region, the school provides students with nutritious meals, medical and dental attention, and after school activities. \n\nThe region lacks even the most basic emergency services and KVS frequently acts as a community center in crisis situations. During the August 2014 floods in the area, the school provided food, medical aid, and shelter to displaced people. \n\nThe solar installation will be on KVS\u2019s combined hostel and women\u2019s training center. 50 vulnerable women reside at the hostel and the center trains approximately 60 women and girls each year. The center\u2019s goal is to educate girls and women from Surkhet and neighboring villages in order to promote their economic self-sufficiency. Classes cover a range of topics including parenting, human rights, health, stress management, and self-confidence. The women spend much of their time on literacy, learning to read and write in both Nepali and English. They also learn vocational skills, including sewing, gardening, computer education, and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe Kopila Valley School is connected to a hydroelectric grid, but the staff, volunteers, and students must deal with daily power outages lasting as long as 18 hours a day.  Even when electricity is available, the voltage is only 160V rather than the 220V necessary to fully power the school\u2019s equipment. As a result of this energy situation, students struggle to read or do their homework, staff are unable to do administrative work, it is difficult to prepare the student\u2019s meals (which for many is their main meal of the day), and teachers and students cannot access electronic media devices, which are more and more essential to training. To compensate for uneven energy, KVS uses backup diesel, which is both expensive and environmentally damaging. \n\nInstalling a solar energy system at Kopila Valley School will have environmental, social, and economic outcomes for the school and region.

The initial start up capital of $200.000 Colombian pesos was provided by her husband and with this she obtained excellent results, so much so that she was able to buy a cooler to diversify the range of products that she sold. Due to this, in 2004 she decided to make the most important change of her life and \"start a prosperous business\".

Fanny's working day goes from 4pm to 9pm.

This is the reason why she is applying for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo which will be used to buy stationery, clothes and footwear.

Caroline practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm, and knowledge attained from the agricultural training she has undergone with Juhudi Kilimo. Caroline operates the only posho mill in her village. \r\n\r\nCaroline\u2019s sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg-selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that she faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Caroline is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. \r\n\r\nWith the motorbike, she will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Caroline is very determined to succeed. Because she is much disciplined with finances, she plans that through accumulated profits, she will be able to provide a secure future for herself and also for her parents. \r\n\r\nCaroline\u2019s dream is to go back to school, and she hopes that through your loan, you will help her realize her dream.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":628.99,"image":{"id":1729508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops and personal businesses. Priscila is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. Her biggest challenge over the years as a farmer has been lack of adequate capital. It is very hard for small-holder farmers to save enough capital for expansion since farming is marred with all sorts of external risks, such as climatic conditions, pests and diseases, political instability, fluctuation of prices and high costs of inputs. Because of these factors, the sure way farmers can obtain adequate capital is through leveraging their businesses.

","en":"Burulbubu is 52 years old, married and a mother of 3 children. Burulbubu has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry, growing, preparing and selling agricultural products - vegetables and fruits - since 2009. Her business contains 1 cow, 30 sheep and 1 horse. She grows peas and beans on 1.40 hectares of land. The whole family happily helps Burulbubu with running her business. Because all of Burulbubu's products are ecologically clean, home-made and extremely tasty, they are in high demand, and the number of customers grows each day. Burulbubu requested a loan in the amount of 125,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy one cow and 15 sheep. She is planning to invest the earnings from the loan in further increasing her livestock quantities.

Just like many other households in the village, cultivating rice is also the main production of Huong's family, with which they have plenty of experience. However, rice production doesn't bring enough income to cover living expenses for her family and pay tuition fees for their children. For that reason, she has diversified into more agricultural activities, including raising pigs, chickens, and buffalo. Among those businesses, raising pigs generates more earnings than the others, so she has decided to expand her pig raising. \r\n\r\nTo do that, she has taken out loans from Anh Chi Em Program for more capital for investment and to receive training and technical support from the Program. This is the third loan she has had and she will use the loan to buy piglets. Huong hopes her investment will go well so she may gradually improve her family's living conditions, especially for her children to have a good education.

Although she earns a handsome profit from farming, she faces one big challenge: the high prices being charged for fertilizers, seedlings and inputs. The Kiminini area has only one agro dealer catering to thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on him for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them higher prices and so enjoying a monopoly. \r\n<p>\r\nJenifer wants to change this. She is requesting a 65,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to start an agro-vet shop. Through this loan she will be able to help the smallholder farmers in her area, who for a long time have had a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. She will also transition from the smallholder farmer she is right now to being a certified agro dealer who will be depended on by nearly 1,000 smallholder farmers in her area both for input, knowledge and information about improved inputs. \r\n<p>\r\nThrough increased income from the loan, Jenifer will improve her living conditions as well. Her future plans are to purchase a truck to be used to engage farmers in output marketing activities. She believes one can find rewarding employment in farming. She patiently waits for your kindness.\r\n<p>\r\nJenifer is only one of a new generation of farmers who are realizing that the elusive white-collar job is not worth chasing after all. This crop of young energetic farmers has its eyes on good money, the kind that salaries will not give them. They have turned to agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nThe idea of earning a decent yet fixed income is now old-fashioned. Now, integrating traditional agriculture with new technology is how young farmers are boosting high-quality yields and profits. They are using knowledge gained from various agricultural training programs to create innovative products and add value to existing ones.

But due to some financial constraints, he is not able to buy these items for his business purpose. Therefore, Altaf has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

However, for Beatrice, somehow life begins at 50. \r\n\r\nThis mother of seven has been practising mixed farming for the past twenty four years on her small parcel of land in the Kitale area of Kenya and has been earning a decent income. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate into an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry sales to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":278.74,"image":{"id":1729671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

baker since 1995.

I think my story is worth hearing about, because it was hard for me to get where I am now. After I graduated from my high school, I wanted to study here. However, my parents wanted me to study medicine and become a doctor. I went to medical academy, and after two years, I had to fight against my parents\u2019 decision and persuade them to let me study in liberal arts university. I did not enjoy studying in medical academy at all. My parents were upset about the whole thing, however they agreed with my decision. \r\n\r\n\"Now, I know that one has to fight to achieve any goals. It was a good lesson for my life, now I know that I have to fight hard for my decisions 'til the end. I chose Anthropology Department, and I would like to learn about cultures, people and many other exciting things. Financial aid from AUCA and Kiva would help me to achieve my goals for life. The Anthropology Department of AUCA is the best one in Kyrgyzstan. It gives a chance to practice your knowledge in different parts of Kyrgyzstan and abroad. I am looking forward to them.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1729676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

The demand for horticultural products such as fruits and vegetables has grown steadily in Kenya in recent years. As much as they have become one of the top traded agricultural products, there is still plenty of room to expand. Dorine is very excited to start commercialization of her crops. \r\n\r\nWith your $25 loan, this can be easily achieved. She will rely on other sources of income to pay the initial installments on the loan, but in no time the horticultural farm will start pumping in income.

remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of one child sells milk, eggs and a variety of crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nTaking care of her poultry is an activity that she finds very enjoyable, and feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Kitale area. Catherine has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market - the demand is very high. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry, so now she is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Catherine can achieve their dreams and goals. Catherine believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding and good care. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. \r\n\r\nIn addition to selling eggs and poultry, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings.

She lives in the small village of Bia with her husband, parents-in-law and daughter. The family members are involved in agricultural activity, which is the main source of income. \r\n\r\nParticularly, Lali and her husband take care of 2 horses and a plot of agricultural land where nuts and laurel are grown. However, the family doesn't generate enough income to meet even basic needs and cover all daily costs, so they live in poverty and require additional income for their well-being. \r\n\r\nBecause of this situation, Lali requested a loan for starting a retail business with sheep at the local market. Her attempt was unsuccessful the first time, because of her family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe Start Up program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, gives a chance to poor people to start or re-start businesses. The loan will be a great support to this hardworking woman and her family, enabling her to generate additional income and easily cover everyday expenses.\r\n \r\nLali and her family rely on the good will of Kiva lenders and will appreciate their help and kindness. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1729716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To start a retail business with sheep and increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2014-11-10T21:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-10T21:50:06Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":44.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":51.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":35.4,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":36.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579623980},{"amount":25.48,"local_amount":43.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-22T10:45:17Z","rounded_local_amount":44.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595206530},{"amount":24.55,"local_amount":44.52,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.42,"payment_id":610601872},{"amount":23.69,"local_amount":46.01,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.15,"payment_id":624876072},{"amount":24.54,"local_amount":48.94,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.01,"payment_id":636277148},{"amount":181.41,"local_amount":381.46,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":389.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":41.1,"payment_id":649613163}],"funded_date":"2014-11-15T03:45:24Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:54:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":794858,"name":"Abida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abida  is a 41-year-old married, working woman.

In the daytime, she supports her parents in the agricultural activities of the family. \r\n\r\nShe also is the leader of the Maa Tarini Self-Help Group of her village. The members of the community decided to take up loans for financially supporting their families.

There is no doubting her deep connection to farm animals, as she names and occasionally talks to her animals.\r\n\r\n Leah is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. Farming tools are very crucial to all farmers regardless of the nature of the agribusiness they are involved in. With your loan, Leah will acquire farm implements that will make her work in the field much easier and efficient. These benefits will translate to efficiency, improved quality and profits. Additional income as a result will help Leah to foot the high farming costs that keep rising by the day. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Leah replied \"More income will help me buy more assets and be able to pay school fees for my school going children.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":221.33,"image":{"id":1729737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-10T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-10T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.35,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1351.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1391.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1431.98},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1473.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1516.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1561.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1606.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1653.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1702.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1751.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1803.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1855.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1910.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1965.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2023.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.03,"local_amount":3085.59,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3321.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194638},{"amount":17.51,"local_amount":1459.55,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1571.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262453},{"amount":31.73,"local_amount":2644.31,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2846.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264529},{"amount":24.17,"local_amount":2014.18,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2168.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459208},{"amount":18.92,"local_amount":1622.97,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1747.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.56,"payment_id":681377613},{"amount":19.35,"local_amount":1671.97,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"payment_id":696587316},{"amount":3.71,"local_amount":330.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":355.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.25,"payment_id":711505609},{"amount":43.35,"local_amount":3779.42,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4068.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2,"payment_id":731022428},{"amount":21.21,"local_amount":1836.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1976.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"payment_id":752110686}],"funded_date":"2014-11-11T20:48:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":790665,"name":"Leonor Olivia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonor: Es una se\u00f1ora amable de 60 a\u00f1os de edad, casada tiene 3 hijos mayores de edad.

With the Kiva loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support,he can now store his maize at harvest and sell it later at prices up to 40% higher. \n\nThis allows Gabriel to generate earnings of up to $1,000\/hectare, more than four times Nigerian farmers' annual income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1720873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pruchase agricultural inputs and store his harvest to sell it later on at higher prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-10T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-10T23:00:04Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":8623,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":8623}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-12T01:29:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Yan","image":1083582}},{"id":794801,"name":"Jay Maa Santoshi Shg (A) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jay Maa Santoshi Self-Help Group (A) comprises nine members from Belaguntha village of Dhenkanal district, Odisha, India.

She is married and has four children. She lives with her family in a rural area. She always cares for the well-being of her children, so she started her own business dealing with animal husbandry five months ago. She has one cow and two sheep. She feeds cattle at her house where she has a cowshed. \r\n\r\nZaynura is going to increase the number of cattle she feeds and in this way will develop her new business.

He is married to Elaine, a businesswoman, and has three children who are all in the Elementary Level. His wife is a direct seller of Vita-Plus and they both work to meet their everyday needs and to support their  children's schooling. \r\n\r\nEdmund has been operating a tricycle for three years already. His tricycle carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the province of Dasmarinas, a tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited . Very few people own a vehicle.  The town people usually ride a tricycle from their homes to the market, church, to their friends' homes and to other destinations within their community. They even  transport from one town to the other. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue his transport business, he is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan, which he will use to pay for gas and maintenance of his tricycle. He is positive that this will boost his income as tricycle transportation is really a necessity in their area.\r\n\r\nEdmund dreams of being successful in his business so he can give his family a much better life. He aims to give his children the best education. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1728528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay for maintenance and gas for his tricycle service.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-11T00:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-11T00:10:07Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edmund","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.02,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3585.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535909},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1792.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134255},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2390.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757023},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200162}],"funded_date":"2014-11-11T00:44:57Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":792866,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is a hardworking entrepreneur who buys and sells charcoal in the Philippines.

Her youngest child is 16 years old.  She has been involved in animal husbandry since 1991 when she started in this business using an initial capital of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her perseverance and determination, she has achieved good results, and she now owns one cow, one young bull, five sheep, five goats and one horse.  Her children help her run the farming business.  Saadbatbu's family is very hardworking and friendly.  Saadatbu makes a monthly income of 8,000 som (KGS), which is vastly insufficient to provide a decent living and to cover the children's needs.  Realizing that she could make more money with her farming business and in order to increase her cattle headcount, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 70,000 som (KGS).

Eager to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy an additional cow, as well as some potato seeds and fertilizers, in order to prepare the soil for cultivation.

Meet Edinah, a youthful, 24-year-old mum, who is the mother of four good-looking children. She is based in Waitaluk, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. This is an area with high poultry production and consumption. For five years Edinah has been actively involved in mixed farming as a source of income. She has a beautiful and supportive man, who helps her with farm work and domestic chores. Her primary sources of income are milk, crops, and some personal business that she does to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming, and this can be noticed in how she takes good care of her poultry birds and feeds them. When she was asked what she enjoys about poultry farming, she replied that she enjoys \u201cpicking up the eggs every day in the morning.\u201d However, this humble and honest mum faces challenges of not meeting the demand for eggs, and not satisfying her ever-increasing client base. That is why she is requesting a loan -- to buy good quality breeds of poultry birds. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture, and the demand for chicken is always high, because it is such a popular meal for so many people. In addition to earning increased profits, Edinah will benefit from poultry manure, which will save her some money that she otherwise would have used to buy fertilizer. With the increased income from selling eggs, poultry meat, and feathers, she will permanently change her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going

She is a mother of 3 with a deeply engraved passion in dairy farming. After all, that is what she has been doing for over 10 years. She owns a small farm in Roret village which is situated in Litein area of Kenya. The income she makes from farming is not sufficient to comfortably sustain her family. As a result, Zeddy has ventured into a couple of small side businesses to make extra shillings. With the aid of her hardworking handsome husband, Zeddy also rears poultry and grows maize, amongst other crops. \r\n\r\nZeddy is seeking a loan of KES 35,000 for constructing a cowshed. She plans to put up a well-designed barn that will provide a clean, comfortable home for her herd and a pleasant, efficient workplace for her. In a bid to increase milk production, the cowshed will provide a favorable environment for the cows. With your loan, Zeddy has carefully planned for the storage and handling of milk, feed, bedding and manure, as these account for most of the labour in any dairy farm. The housing will have a plentiful, dependable supply of good water, made available 24 hours a day. The income she will make from this investment will put her in a position to comfortably afford increasing farming costs. Her family also stands to benefit from the growth of their agri-business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":365.44,"image":{"id":1729797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To construct a cowshed for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-11T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-11T03:20:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.63,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.43,"local_amount":5462.74,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5600.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194641},{"amount":30.13,"local_amount":2636.78,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2703.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262456},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":5000.26,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5126.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264531},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":3402.63,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3488.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600763},{"amount":32.65,"local_amount":2941.39,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.97,"payment_id":681377616},{"amount":74.19,"local_amount":6730.22,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":6899.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.73,"payment_id":696587318},{"amount":63.37,"local_amount":5801.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5947.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.93,"payment_id":731022430}],"funded_date":"2014-11-18T08:26:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":794959,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is a married woman and has children, all of whom attend school.

Margret hopes that in the future she will be able to enhance her business. \r\n\r\nMargret is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Margret who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

He spends the income from milk, tea and other side businesses to provide for his family of eight children.\r\n \r\nJames stated that he appreciates the fact that his dairy business is profitable and sustainable. He intends to expand it but he lacks the funds necessary for it. He is appealing to Kiva lenders to help him out with a KES 40,000 loan to construct a cowshed.\r\n\r\nThe cowshed James has in place is temporary and not very good in design and structure. With your loan however, he will be able to put up a decent shelter to protect his animals against harsh weather. The shelter will also facilitate introduction of zero-grazing in future. James told our loan officer that he expects an increase in milk production from this investment. The additional income will help him settle other farm expenses that are currently out of reach. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":446.07,"image":{"id":1729843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to construct a cowshed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-11T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-11T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.97,"local_amount":6753.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194645},{"amount":68.47,"local_amount":6086.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262457},{"amount":70.08,"local_amount":6229.6,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6286.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600764},{"amount":60.23,"local_amount":5513.26,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5563.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.79,"payment_id":681377618},{"amount":48.06,"local_amount":4561.86,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4603.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.26,"payment_id":711505613},{"amount":13.75,"local_amount":1277.91,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1289.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":731022432},{"amount":99.9,"local_amount":9229.46,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":9314.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.93,"payment_id":752110690}],"funded_date":"2014-12-10T21:06:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":795001,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello lenders! Meet Agnes, a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past five years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes she has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents. <br \/><br \/>Agnes lives near Waitaluk in the Kitale area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. <br \/><br \/>The Waitaluk area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Agnes intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between. <br \/><br \/>To accomplish this, Agnes is applying for a 40,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Agnes sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. She patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300.14,"image":{"id":1729847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an electric posho mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-11T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-11T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1684.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1772.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1824.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1877.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1932.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1988.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2046.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2106.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2168.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2231.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2296.81},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2363.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2433.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2504.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2577.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2652.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2730.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2809.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.71},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.91,"local_amount":2125.4,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2144.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194646},{"amount":3.98,"local_amount":354.16,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":357.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824045},{"amount":21.58,"local_amount":1918.53,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1936.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262458},{"amount":8.62,"local_amount":766.13,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":773.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264535},{"amount":242.05,"local_amount":21515.86,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":21713.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600765}],"funded_date":"2014-11-11T19:31:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":795002,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a businessman in the general market in Mbarara district.

years ago, Esther started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Roret, a remote village in the Litein area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of four children sells milk, eggs, maize and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart. Every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. A good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax and also protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Esther believes that, with this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.
