In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a common family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. However, it is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one or two people only, as buying cooked rice and food costs less than the raw ingredients. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nLeonisa hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life.

She inspects garments, such as men's denim slacks, during manufacturing operations to determine the number of defects per worker and reasons for rejects by examiners. She counts the number of pattern parts, lays of cloth prior to cutting, number of stitches per inch during sewing operation, and other measurement knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Lourdes, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Lourdes is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to  loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward for your positive response and anything coming from you will surely be of great help. Lourdes also find ways to improve her income by selling pizza  and tocino, and she will use her loan to buy raw ingredients needed to generate more profit from this sideline. She will also use the loan for her child\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\r\nLourdes wants to be always efficient and productive in her workplace, and she also hopes to grow her business. She dreams of giving her family a better future through all her hard work. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1730130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy supplies needed to make pizza and tocino.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-11T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-11T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":9999.99,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10153.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535941},{"amount":225,"local_amount":9999.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10153.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134286},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6768.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757055},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6768.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200194},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.7,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6768.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186495}],"funded_date":"2014-11-12T01:50:36Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":795255,"name":"Tuan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuan, 43 years old, is divorced and has a son.

This business serves a breakfast of soups, bites and tea; and a lunch of rice, ugali and cooked banana with meat, vegetables, and beans. Her business is open from 6 AM to 6 PM. With these hours, she is able to make a fair profit, which she uses to cover school fees, rent, family meals, and purchases of a cupboard, bed and mattress, and business chairs. \r\n\r\nShe is really working hard to sustain the well-being of her family. In the coming years, Mariam would like to make sure her kids can attend a university. \r\n\r\nMariam is now requesting her third loan via Tujijenge Tanzania, a Kiva partner. She managed to repay back the previous loans successfully and used them  to buy charcoal cooking stoves, utensils and ingredients. She really improved her business, and much thanks goes to Kiva lenders who supported her business and other group members. Even though Mariam migrated to a new place without having anything but her family, loans from Tujijenge Tanzania made all of this possible.\r\n \r\nMariam will share this credit with her group, Wakorintho, which consists of seven members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

Her intentions are to request a loan and improve their commercial activities. \r\nShe personally makes a living selling typical lunch dishes such as: saice (ground beef and rice), plato pace\u00f1o (corn on the cob, potatoes, broad beans, cheese and meat), trucha frita (fried trout), revuelto (french fries, ground beef, peas and rice), sajta de pollo (spicy chicken) and others. She sells them out of a stand that she inherited from her mother more than twenty years ago. \r\nThis is the first sequence of loans with the institution in all the time that she has been cooking. Her business enjoys regular clients that work in the area and eat there every day.

She is a mother of four children. She adores her family, and her husband works very hard so that his family can have a good and respectable life. Her husband owns a clothing sales business, which is the only source of income for the family. Presently he needs additional capital for the growth of the business. Therefore, Rehana is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell. The new inventory will enable him to respond quickly to customer needs. With the help of the profit amount, he will put aside some savings to pay the electricity and gas bills. Rehana hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

The above picture presents to you Wilter, who lives in the Kisii area of Kenya, also known as the land of bananas because it produces high quality bananas.\r\n\r\nWilter is the mother of one lovely and adorable child that she really treasures and values. She is 44 years of age and has been practicing mixed farming for the last 10 years. Over those years, she has gathered much experience and has all of the farming techniques at her fingertips. Wilter is a very dedicated farmer and has been able to support her family and take her child to school.\r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making a profit, not everything has been good for this enterprising mother. She wants to start poultry farming and take advantage of the ready market for poultry products that is already there in her village. Wilter has a never-say-die attitude and has always had challenges accessing funds, but she now feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva help enterprising women like her.\r\n\r\nWilter has learned the saving culture and she is sure that with the increased income from selling eggs and poultry products, she will be able to open a large business where she will be selling poultry feed and also poultry products.

She is encouraged she will get a good return on her investment and is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nMelinda hopes to give her children a better future and dreams for her business to continue growing. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draws strength and inspiration from her studies of the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Meet Mary, an ever-smiling young farmer who is responsible and has had to overcome many difficulties through her life. However, she has always found the strength to move forward and to keep growing in her life.\r\n\r\nShe has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nMary passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nMary is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With the loan capital, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help to fully satisfy the demand.\r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money in order to repay the loan fully and to improve her living

She is 62 years old and is blessed with 10 adorable children. She lives with her large family in the Kitale area of Kenya. Her children are  her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide them with a better future.\r\n\r\nConceleta was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 20 years. She always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d As an example of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cmaua\u201d (flower), which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. \r\n\r\nThrough her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. Conceleta also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. \r\n\r\nModern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and as a result, increased profit levels.

is 53 years old, married and a resident of Calaran, Calamba, Philippines.  Her husband is a tricycle driver. They are blessed with 4 children. \r\n\r\nBecause it is hard for them to survive if only her husband is working, she decided to engage in selling. She started a sari-sari (mini- grocery) store with a capital of 3,000 PHP. Her primary customers are her neighbors. She was successful and able to manage it well. \r\n\r\nShe was able to finance the daily needs of her family with the help of Paglaum Cooperative; she became a member in April 2007. She was able to avail herself of two loans and repaid them religiously. Now, she is applying for a loan of 14,900 PHP to finance the purchase of additional stock for her sari-sari store. \r\n\r\nShe is looking forward to expanding her sari-sari into a Mini-mart someday.

This new loan will go to additional supplies of accessories and spare parts for her tricycle.

He has the equivalent of a high school education and is now a pensioner.  He is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute an additional source of income for his family.  He started in this field in 1990 when he bought his first livestock.  Thanks to his perseverance and hard work, he currently owns eight sheep.  In addition, he also cultivates crops on a seasonal basis, growing corn and potatoes on 0.54 hectare of land.  In order to further develop his animal husbandry business, he has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  He will use this loan to purchase young bulls and sheep.  Azimzham intends to resell his livestock at the local cattle market and to reinvest the earnings from his loan into further increasing his livestock headcount.  This will lead to larger profits as he will resell more livestock and meat.  Azimzhan is planning to use the income from his business to save enough money to finish building his house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1729693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been able to sustain the livelihood of her family of three children for the last ten years by selling milk, eggs, and other crops produced on her farm. \r\n\r\nMany farmers are just like Linet; they practice mixed farming. Most of their problems are with crop farming, where the tasks take too much time to accomplish. It requires a lot of effort and labour to plough and cultivate land. Machinery and equipment come in handy to reduce all sorts of costs. \r\n\r\nLinet is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. Old or poor farm implements usually result in high costs and poor quality of work. This is a clear recipe for losses. To resolve this issue, she joined a group named Soku Women Self Help Group in order to access Juhudi Kilimo\u2019s agricultural loans. \r\n\r\nJuhudi offers loans to individual farmers in a group whose members share a strong bond of solidarity. Your loan contribution will enable Linet to afford proper farm implements necessary for quality work output on the farm. With the increased yields, she will comfortably afford her children\u2019s education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1730436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-12T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-12T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3145.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3280.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3376.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3577.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3681.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3789.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3899.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4013.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4131.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4252},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4376.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.28,"local_amount":7309.86,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":7649.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194658},{"amount":80.5,"local_amount":6899.88,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7220.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262472},{"amount":84,"local_amount":7200.28,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7535.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600778},{"amount":197.8,"local_amount":17459.27,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":18271.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.89,"payment_id":681377631},{"amount":68.83,"local_amount":6130.71,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6415.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.7,"payment_id":752110700}],"funded_date":"2014-11-23T06:49:08Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Ernest","image":627833}},{"id":791259,"name":"Jose Ramiro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ramiro es un se\u00f1or de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, el tiene 2 hijos, la hija tiene 15 y el hijo 9 a\u00f1os mismos que se encuentran estudiando, Ramiro trabaja en una planta flor\u00edcola y adiciona a eso se dedica a la crianza de animales, el cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para hacer la compra de chanchos que los compra en el campo y que los vende en las ferias de la ciudad m\u00e1s cercana, la aspiraci\u00f3n de Ramiro es mejorar su negocio todo para el bienestar de sus hijos.","en":"Ramiro is a 44-year-old man.

She is based in a small village called Mukuni, near Chuka, Kenya. This charming mother has been doing agriculture on her small, fertile piece of land for 10 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops. Ireen is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. Her biggest challenge over the years as a farmer has been the lack of adequate capital. It is very hard for small farmers to save enough capital for expansion, since farming is marred with all sorts of external risks, such as climatic conditions, pests and diseases, political instability, fluctuation of prices and high costs of inputs. Because of these factors, the sure way farmers can obtain adequate capital is through leveraging their businesses. With your loan investment, Ireen is going to expand her horticultural farm in order to increase its output. If and when the investment pays off, Ireen will plough the profits back into the farm and increase her asset base."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1730444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-12T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-12T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ireen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.9,"local_amount":8339.04,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":8602.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194659},{"amount":87.62,"local_amount":7619.55,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7859.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262473},{"amount":98.41,"local_amount":8557.25,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8827.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600779},{"amount":98.91,"local_amount":8857.34,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":9136.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.95,"payment_id":681377632},{"amount":98,"local_amount":9100.49,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9387.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.66,"payment_id":711505625},{"amount":83.27,"local_amount":7526.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7763.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.28,"payment_id":752110701}],"funded_date":"2014-11-26T20:51:58Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":795470,"name":"Rolly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolly earns a living from selling fruits in the market to make a living.

She lives with her husband and five children, on a humble farm in the rural zone of Kinono, in the Nkubu area of Kenya. Up until now, she has had the valor and courage to raise her children by her own means. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet.<br \/><br \/>Bridget passionately loves dairy farming. When she was asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking Mutune (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk production. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and an increased income level. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and to grow her business enterprise further.<br \/><br \/>Bridget is very visionary. She intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling. She also intends to begin selling dairy products, such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1730462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another dairy cow and increase milk production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-12T04:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-12T04:00:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bridget","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":2473.95,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-20T10:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2588.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":581625410},{"amount":22.17,"local_amount":1900.59,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1988.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194661},{"amount":22.48,"local_amount":1926.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2016.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262475},{"amount":22.07,"local_amount":1891.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1979.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264546},{"amount":33.91,"local_amount":2906.86,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3042.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600781},{"amount":31.78,"local_amount":2723.82,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2850.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459221},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2574.52,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2694.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.87,"payment_id":681377634},{"amount":152.69,"local_amount":13601.85,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":14234.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6,"payment_id":752110703}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T16:18:57Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy L.","image":1250665}},{"id":795481,"name":"Purity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Purity is married woman with three children, all of whom attend school.

She has been involved in animal husbandry since 1994, and this activity constitutes her family's main source of income.  She currently owns three dairy cows, four young bulls, three horses and 25 sheep.  She sells milk to the local residents on a daily basis.  She receives a high demand for the milk that she produces, thus making a nice profit.  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy young bulls for fattening and resale.  She is planning to reinvest the earnings from her loan into further increasing her farming business.

They generate money only for covering basic needs; they live in poverty because they have no additional income for well-being. \r\n\r\nAccording to the above-mentioned situation, Tea lacks access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require stable income and business experience also.  The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Tea to get a loan of 1,500 USD. \r\n\r\nShe will renovate the house and will rent it out to guests.
