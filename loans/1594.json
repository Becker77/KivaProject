He would like to invest in a purchase of raw materials, including wood, sand paper, stain, polish and brass.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAbdul has been selling through NOVICA since 2012. This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"My father, who is also a carver, introduced me to crafts. I started with sandpapering at the age of ten after school. After I mastered that skill, I moved on to learn how to cut the brass and aluminum used to adorn the mask. I also was trained in painting masks and applying beads to them. The fixing of the beads happens to be a difficult part, but the final outcome of the artwork and their attractive, beautiful nature are what make me want to affix the beads over and over again. When I completed high school, I decided to continue in this field. I worked together with my father for a while before he agreed to let me be on my own. I work in his workshop but can sell my designs myself. I therefore have to come up with my own styles. What attracts me most about my art is creating beaded designs, because it is believed that beads are very attractive and drive attention to the work. My hope and dream is to become a renowned artist of my time.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful to those who help to finance this microcredit.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Abdul's carved African masks on the NOVICA site:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8512\">http:\/\/www.novica.com\/kiva\/8512<\/a>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1730635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Fair Trade","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase raw materials, including wood, sand paper, stain, polish and brass.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Accra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.55 -0.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2014-11-12T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-12T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2.25,"local_amount":2.25,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-31T10:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595290466},{"amount":16.5,"local_amount":16.5,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":16.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610681819},{"amount":10.5,"local_amount":10.5,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624364341},{"amount":10.35,"local_amount":10.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636433575},{"amount":33,"local_amount":33,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649702178},{"amount":27,"local_amount":27,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665191264},{"amount":9,"local_amount":9,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T16:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681497870},{"amount":91.4,"local_amount":91.4,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T16:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":91.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696704524}],"funded_date":"2014-11-12T17:51:41Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T16:14:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":795775,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0438\u0434\u0430, 33 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u0410\u0438\u0434\u044b -

Thanks to her tireless work Aida now owns two cows and five sheep. Her monthly income is around 25,000 som (KGS), and she sells on average 20 liters of milk each day to locals. In order to further develop her business she contacted Bai-Tushum Bank for a 150,000 som (KGS) loan to buy three milk cows, which will increase the volume of environmentally clean, delicious, home-produced milk she has to sell. Income from use of the loan will help expand her livestock herd."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1730850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy three dairy cows so that she can sell more eco-friendly milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tokmok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-11-12T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-12T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12273},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13574},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13947},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14330},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14724},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15129},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15545},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15973},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16412},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18093}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.07},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.53},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":452.32,"local_amount":25847,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":26052.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436597},{"amount":244.07,"local_amount":13947,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":14057.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799289},{"amount":504.83,"local_amount":29054,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":29284.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.61,"payment_id":636161440},{"amount":536.79,"local_amount":30674,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":30917.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995593},{"amount":883.38,"local_amount":50478,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50878.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500230}],"funded_date":"2014-12-12T15:47:34Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":795586,"name":"Phoebe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phoebe is a married woman.

I started sewing when I was 12 years old and tall enough for my legs to reach the pedals. Where I come from, Sankamphaeng, is renowned for its silk and cotton, and girls are expected to know how to sew. Since people now buy their clothes at stores, I turned to making handbags, since there can be a variety of designs, uses, and beautiful styles.\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy to always get the same fabric color and pattern. So, when it is available, I need to buy as much as I can and keep it on hand to be able to make more bags in the same style. This also allows me to obtain a much better price for the material.

years old, married, and has two children. She has been selling women's clothing and shoes in one of the city's stores since 1991. Gulsara has a higher education, and she is very hard working and responsible. There is high demand for her products, which earns her on average 35,000 som (KGS) in monthly income. Gulsara contacted Bai-Tushum Bank for a 150,000 som (KGS) loan to widen the assortment of goods in her store, specifically winter clothes and shoes, since she expects high demand this season. Once her turnover has increased Gulsara can expand her store, earn more income, and save for her son's wedding.

Although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nRose will purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to study.

children.  She has a higher education and has been working in agriculture since 1994.  She currently owns two cows and seven sheep.  In addition, she is also involved in crop farming, growing clover and potatoes on her own plot of land measuring 1.5 hectare.

She is very thankful to Kiva and to everyone who helped her get this financing.  She currently owns one cow and six sheep, and also grows wheat and peas on 1.92 hectare of land.

Margaret's primary sources of income are milk, eggs, and some personal business she engages in to make extra cash. \n\nOver a long period of time, Margaret has slowly, but surely, developed a passionate interest in poultry farming. The biggest challenge she faces, however, is a lack of capital to buy additional poultry birds. Therefore, she is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders, via Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to purchase high-quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \n\nHaving additional poultry will bring a significant increase in egg production and, consequently, more income. She can also derive other products from poultry such as meat, which is a plus to the overall income generated. \n\nHer plan is to improve her family's living conditions.

Her mother is a sales lady at a used-clothing shop and gets 100 GEL monthly. According to the above-mentioned situation, the family finds it hard to cover even basic needs and have financial stability.\r\n \r\nDali requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her trading business startup but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because the creditors did not find the existing family income to be sufficient to approve the loan. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. Dali requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. With the received credit, Dali will purchase a stock of clothing and home products at the worldwide market, located in the capital and will sell at increased prices among her employees. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Their income will double, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1731295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To start a trading business with clothing and home products and generate additional income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gori","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T05:40:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T05:40:19Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":22.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":26.87},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":36.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":38.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.72},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.72,"local_amount":22.72,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T14:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":22.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579623981},{"amount":26.87,"local_amount":26.87,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-22T10:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":26.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595206531},{"amount":27.12,"local_amount":27.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":27.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610601873},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":27.94,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":27.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624876073},{"amount":30.22,"local_amount":30.22,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":30.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636277149},{"amount":29.69,"local_amount":29.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":29.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649613164},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665092902},{"amount":404.44,"local_amount":404.44,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":404.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681390673}],"funded_date":"2014-11-17T20:14:52Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T15:12:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":796079,"name":"Kate","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kate is a 40-year-old married lady living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Meet Gladys, a 38-year-old youthful, very hardworking, honest, and ever smiling mother of four children. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Kapsowar, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Gladys passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past five years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. Gladys has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and the price of milk in the recent past has been going up, so Gladys, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. Gladys said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and from the training, she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Gladys hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":534.68,"image":{"id":1731307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":48610,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3440.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3540.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3644.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3750.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3860.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3973.21},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4089.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4208.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4331.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4458.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4588.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4722.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.71,"local_amount":8370.39,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8495.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194665},{"amount":81.58,"local_amount":7209.89,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7317.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262479},{"amount":89.11,"local_amount":7875.96,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7993.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600785},{"amount":261.5,"local_amount":23799.31,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":24154.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.78,"payment_id":681377638}],"funded_date":"2014-11-13T23:53:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":791822,"name":"Carlos Alfonso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos de 30 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su compa\u00f1era de vida, el trabaja como empleado en una empresa privada, con lo que gana en su trabajo logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, el quiere mejorar su vivienda construyendo un cuarto en el lugar que muestra la fotograf\u00eda pero no tiene de suficiente capital por esa raz\u00f3n solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de ladrillos, arena, cemento, hierro, laminas y pago de mano de obra y asi poder vivir mas seguros y c\u00f3modos.","en":"Carlos, 30, lives in his own house with his life partner.

For several years, he worked at the petrol station and now he works as a driver at the seismic station. Yurik, in his village where he was born, has a plot of land where many years ago he planted a nice orchard. He gathers a tasty and nice harvest of apples, peaches, cherries and nuts from his orchard, the greatest part of which he sells to resellers. Yurik is married and he has two daughters and a son; all of them are married and they live separately from their parents. Yurik\u2019s wife works as a nurse at the local polyclinics. As Yurik describes, he works without holidays and all during the day he drives his car. Before, he says, he never felt any hardness and fatigue while driving. He mentions that his eyes are strained during driving, which causes him great difficulties while driving and his family members are greatly worried, since the danger of having a car accident is really great in such a situation.\r\n  \r\nYurik is asking for a loan of 300.000 Armenian drams in order to have urgent surgery on his eyes that the doctor recommended to him, since it is the only way of solving his eye problem. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1731323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

She is blessed with four children, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past 15 years. On her farm, she grows maize, and raises a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs and maize. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meager earnings, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" Her biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Elizabeth formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful).  The cpw produces milk daily, which Elizabeth sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Elizabeth. The money Elizabeth got from selling the milk was adequate to repay the loan. Today, Elizabeth is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Elizabeth is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health and livelihood. Elizabeth patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":365.17,"image":{"id":1731325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2334.56},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2402.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2473.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2545.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2619.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2856.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2939.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3025.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3113.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70.16,"local_amount":5996.74,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6293.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194666},{"amount":64.6,"local_amount":5521.16,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5794.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262480},{"amount":68.05,"local_amount":5815.95,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6104.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600786},{"amount":70.6,"local_amount":6213.8,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6521.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.1,"payment_id":681377639},{"amount":85.7,"local_amount":7662.58,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":8042.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.96,"payment_id":731022449}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T04:03:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":791823,"name":"Yanina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yanina vive en casa de su padres en un acabado de ladrillo y piso de cemento en La Paz.

Su vida la comparte con sus padres que se dedican al comercio en el mercado, y viven en una casa de madera que cuenta con agua y electricidad. Su deseos de mejorar su emprendimiento la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de tomates, taller de costura, tejidos, venta de pescado, servicio de construcci\u00f3n y elaboraci\u00f3n de colchones, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades. Su negocio es la venta de refrescos t\u00edpicos del lugar, como; chicha, som\u00f3, tamarindo, guayaba, achachair\u00fa, limonada y jugo de lima, refrescos de melao o melasa, de miel o el caldo de ca\u00f1a, entre otros. Para la chicha de ma\u00edz los ingredientes son: 1 kilo de harina de ma\u00edz tostada, 1 lata grande de agua, 2 palos de canela grandes. Ella lo prepara de la siguiente manera; Pone la lata con agua al fuego; cuando hierve, agrega la harina de ma\u00edz disuelta en agua fr\u00eda y los palos de canela, luego lo bate hasta que vuelva a hervir, m\u00e1s o menos dos horas.

Su sue\u00f1o es tener un snack grande donde pueda ofrecer variedad de comidas y refrescos tradicionales. Ella desea realizar una inversi\u00f3n en la apertura de un snack para servir comida como masaco que es una masa de yuca con charque (carne deshidratada con sal) y se puede comer frio o caliente.\nEs por esos motivos que Yesica solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la apertura de un snack d\u00f3nde pueda servir comida y refrescos t\u00edpicos.\n","en":"Yesica is an 18 year old young woman. She is single, doesn't have any children, and makes a living selling traditional soft drinks. She is enterprising, hardworking, responsible, dependable, idealistic and very optimistic. She makes her living in her home, located in the southern part of her city. It is an area which is characterised by constant commercial growth in all sectors, and by a warm climate, with a constant temperature of 30 degrees Celsius all year round.  \r\n\r\nYesica has long, black hair, a brown complexion and is of medium height. Her mother tongue is Spanish and she speaks Quechua, due to the background of her family. She shares her life with her parents, who make a living selling products in the market. They live in a wooden house, which has running water and electricity.  \r\n\r\nHer desire to improve her situation led her to form a communal bank, made up of people with businesses such as: selling tomatoes, a sewing workshop, textiles, selling fish, construction services, and mattress manufacturing. They resolved to ask for a loan to improve their businesses.  \r\n\r\nYesica's business sells traditional soft drinks, which are typical of the area, such as: chicha, som\u00f3, tamarind, guava, achachair\u00fa, lemonade, lime juice, and drinks made from melao or melasa, honey, ca\u00f1a broth, among others. \r\n\r\nThe ingredients to make maize chicha are: 1 kilogram of toasted maize flour, 1 large pan of water and two large cinnamon sticks. Yesica prepares it in the following way: put the pan of water on the hob; when it boils, add the maize flour (mixed with cold water) and the cinnamon sticks. Then stir well and bring to boil for more or less two hours. Take it off the hob and allow it to cool. Once cold, strain the chicha and add sugar. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan cycle in 5 years with Kiva for Yesica.

Su vida la realiza sola y vive en una casa propia de ladrillo que cuenta con agua y electricidad. Su deseo por mejorar su calidad de vida la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; artesan\u00eda en yeso, venta de refrescos, venta de ropa, venta de fruta, venta de tomates, librer\u00eda y venta de productos cosm\u00e9ticos, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus actividades comerciales.\nGuillermina es de tez morena, cabello negro largo, estatura mediana, su lengua materna es el Quechua y habla espa\u00f1ol por el comercio (en la foto sentada). Su negocio es la venta de empanadas; que son una fina masa de pan, masa quebrada u hojaldre rellena con una preparaci\u00f3n salada o dulce y cocida al horno o frita. El relleno puede incluir carnes rojas o blancas, pescado, verduras o fruta. La masa, generalmente, es de harina de trigo \u2013aunque tambi\u00e9n usa harina de ma\u00edz y otros cereales\u2013 y suele llevar alguna grasa, aceite o manteca.

Her business is selling empanadas and fruit drinks in the streets.<br \/><br \/>She is enterprising, independent, a fighter, consistent, active, responsible and hard-working. She has lived her life alone and lives in her own house made of brick which has water and electricity. Her desire to improve her life led her to form a group of people with businesses like: plaster handicrafts, selling soft drinks, selling clothing, the sales of fruit, selling tomatoes, a bookstore and the sales of cosmetics, to request a loan to improve their commercial activities.<br \/><br \/>Guillermina is dark skinned, has long black hair and medium stature. Her native tongue is Quechua and she speaks Spanish for her business. (She is seated in the photo). Her business is selling empanadas: which are a fine bread dough in pastry filled with a salty or sweet mixture and baked in the oven or fried. The filling might have red meat, white meat, fish, vegetables or fruit. The pastry is generally made of wheat flour, although she also uses corn flour and other grains and has some lard, oil or butter in it. They are accompanied by typical fruit drinks like mocochinchi (dried peach boiled with cinnamon and sugar), which is very sought after on these hot days that you only get in Santa Cruz. She does her business walking with her basket filled with empanadas and a large thermos in her hand and a packet of plastic cups in the other. This under a burning sun that gets above 30 degrees each day. She walks along the most popular and busiest streets of her city.<br \/><br \/>This is her first loan with the institute that she has had in the 5 years that she has done this business. Her dream is to have a snack bar and wants to make the purchase of chairs and tables to expand her business. Her advanced age makes it hard for her to walk like she used to and she needs a quieter business. <br \/>  <br \/>For these reasons Guillermina is requesting a loan to buy tables and chairs to expand her business and stop selling walking through the

Meet Rose, who is 30 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer based in Kiptumo, a remote village in Nandihills. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture. Rose is happily married and blessed with two children. For the past seven years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. \r\n\r\nShe passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs.\u201d Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nPoultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Nandihills area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. Rose is a member of Arise and Shine Self-Help Group, and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently. Profits from the loan will be used in repaying the loan and increasing her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1731364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1821},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1874.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1929.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1985.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2043.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2103.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2164.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2227.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2292.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2359.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2428.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.64,"local_amount":4386.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4721.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194668},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":3822.85,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4114.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262482},{"amount":49.45,"local_amount":4120.49,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4435.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600788},{"amount":49.98,"local_amount":4289.13,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.49,"payment_id":681377641},{"amount":51.14,"local_amount":4552.02,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4899.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.48,"payment_id":711505631},{"amount":44.21,"local_amount":3829.24,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4121.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.74,"payment_id":752110707}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T10:40:18Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":796122,"name":"Tigran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tigran and his big family live in Kapan city of Syunik region.

But due to financial constraints he is not in a suitable position to buy all of these products for his workshop. \r\n\r\nTherefore Nagina has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan. This loan will enable her husband to buy all these accessories and will also help him to earn maximum profitable income to manage his household and business. \r\n\r\nNagina is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1731380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

She is 55 years old and lives with her seven children in the Nandihills area of Kenya. Her children are her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide them with a better future. Emily was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 20 years. \r\n\r\nBecause of how much she likes farming she has even nicknamed one of her cows Birirmet. She is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10 and 15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. Emily also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nEmily is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year.

Nandi Hills has good weather patterns that favor crop and dairy farming. Hellen is a very hardworking woman who enjoys farming, which she has been doing on her small piece of land for the past 10 years. Through all those years, she has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in her village. Because of the immense knowledge that she has of farming, Hellen offers extension services to other farmers who are new in the business. \r\n\r\nBeing a caring and loving mother, Hellen has been able to take care of her family and support them through the profits she has earned from farming. Although Hellen reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing that is dragging her behind and preventing her from \u201creaching on top of the skies\u201d is a lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, Hellen is seeking a loan of KES 65,000 to be able to buy a piece of land and expand her farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Hellen is sure that she will make good use of the land and double her profit levels. \r\n\r\nThrough the profits, she would be able to repay the loan and improve her living conditions. Hellen is sure that if you invest in her, she will be able to realize her dream of having a good quality life and securing her children's future. Hellen has gone through the repayment schedule and amount, and is comfortable with the plan.

years old, a widow and has an adult son. Turdukan became involved in agriculture -  animal husbandry and farming - over 30 years ago. Her son now helps her. Her business contains 4 dairy cows, 4 heifers, 2 bulls, 1 horse and 20 sheep. Turdukan also grows potatoes, wheat, barley and sainfoin on 2.70 hectares of land. Turdukan has a secondary education. She is very hardworking and responsible. Milk and agricultural products are in high demand; however, she does not have enough money for a decent life and really wants to help her son, and have an ability to buy him his own house. This is why Turdukan requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy bulls. After fattening them up, she will be able to sell them at an attractive price, thus, improving her financial situation and saving money to buy a house for her son.

Meet Lydia, 34 years of age and a very hardworking and self-driven farmer, who is based in Kaptumo, a remote village in Nandi Hills. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. \r\n\r\nLydia is happily married and blessed with four children. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs.\u201d Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Nandi Hills area, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. \r\n\r\nLydia is a member of Arise and Shine, and through the group they have received training on financial management and saving. Through the loan she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions, and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently. Profits from the loan will be used to repay the loan and to increase her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1731424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.92,"local_amount":3103.77,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3132.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194672},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2777.93,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2803.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824062},{"amount":34.9,"local_amount":3102.61,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3130.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262486},{"amount":34.8,"local_amount":3093.56,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3121.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264551},{"amount":36.74,"local_amount":3265.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3295.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600792},{"amount":35.54,"local_amount":3159.31,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459227},{"amount":37.52,"local_amount":3434.57,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3465.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":681377645},{"amount":36.72,"local_amount":3384.14,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3415.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":696587338},{"amount":38.07,"local_amount":3613.92,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3646.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.59,"payment_id":711505635},{"amount":118.99,"local_amount":11064.61,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":11165.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.49,"payment_id":731022453}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T17:11:11Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":796167,"name":"Halime","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halime is married with two children.

and all of her children are grown and independent. Her husband actively helps her with the business. Myskal has a secondary-specialized education. She is a very calm and positive woman. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming. This business started with 5,000 som (KGS) in a distant 1977, now yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month. At the present time, Myskal's business contains 2 cows, 1 horse and 15 sheep. She also grows barley on 1.30 hectares of land.

Meet Selly, a 52-year-old, energetic, self-driven and hard-working small-scale farmer who is based in Kaptumo, a remote village in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. She is a proud mother of four good-looking children and through hard work she has single-handedly raised her  children whom she refers to as \u201cmy pride.\u201d She has been actively  involved in mixed farming for the past 15 years and has never looked back. Her primary income sources have been egg-selling and crop-selling. \r\n\r\nSelly also engages in small personal business or, as she likes to put it, \u201cside hustle\u201d to make ends meet. Selly passionately loves poultry farming and wakes up early every morning to feed her poultry and collect eggs. Demand for eggs and poultry meat has been overwhelming and she has been unable to satisfy the demand. So, she is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what is the biggest challenge she faces, Selly replied, \u201cbeing unable to access funds.\u201d Women have a bigger challenge accessing financial solutions, but Selly feels relieved that there are partners such as Kiva lenders who assist aspiring women to achieve their goals. Through your loan she will be able to buy good breeds of poultry that have high productivity and high resistance to diseases. Increased productivity will immediately translate to more income and improved living standards. Her crops will benefit from poultry manure, which has a high amount of nitrogen as compared to any other livestock manure. Selly will save more money by not having to buy fertilizer. The extra income will be used to repay the loan and secure the future of her children since she is the only breadwinner."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1731435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.7,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.18,"local_amount":11127.15,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":11228.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194673},{"amount":109.2,"local_amount":9706.5,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9795.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264552},{"amount":116.25,"local_amount":10640.56,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10737.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.46,"payment_id":681377646},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":8525.79,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8603.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.24,"payment_id":731022454}],"funded_date":"2014-11-23T09:51:07Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":791871,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Rub\u00e9n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJos\u00e9 de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, no estudio ning\u00fan grado acad\u00e9mico, su esposa se dedica a trabajar en la compra  y venta de pescado,  sus hijos est\u00e1n estudiando en la escuela de la comunidad.\nJos\u00e9 desde que estaba muy peque\u00f1o se ha dedicado a trabajar como pescador artesanal, ya que su padre y hermanos sean dedicado a esta misma actividad, actualmente posee su propia lancha con la que va a pescar por las noches se va a la una de la ma\u00f1ana para salir como a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana, ya que tambi\u00e9n trabaja como corralero en una granja donde tiene que orde\u00f1ar una buena cantidad de animales bovinos, esto lo hace todos los d\u00edas y los d\u00edas, cuando no trabaja como corralero se dedica a trabajar como alba\u00f1il ya que tambi\u00e9n esta actividad se la ense\u00f1o su padre.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que est\u00e1 solicitando, es para comprar cemento, bloque, arena, hierro para terminar de arreglar la vivienda, ya que esta contruyendo otra habitaci\u00f3n, ya que a aumentado el n\u00famero de personas en su familia y quiere que est\u00e9n mas c\u00f3modos en la casa.\nJos\u00e9 espera lograr construir una cocina, ya que la que tiene solo es de l\u00e1mina como techo y sacar adelante a sus hijos d\u00e1ndoles el estudio para que se puedan superar y logren mejores trabajos cuando crezcan .\n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 37 years old.
