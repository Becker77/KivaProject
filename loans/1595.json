Meet Peter, a humble and hardworking farmer with the drive and determination that distinguishes the men and women of Kitale area of Kenya. Kitale is an area that is blessed with favorable weather patterns and is always referred to as the \u201cfood basket \u201carea of Kenya. Peter is very hard working and has been doing farming for the past twelve years.  Through the fruits of his hard work he has been able to take care of his family needs. Through practicing mixed farming, that is dairy farming and crop farming, Peter has been able to always get good returns from these two ventures and he has always managed to put food on the table for his family. Peter is very enterprising, and he wants to start poultry farming so that he can supplement his income and assure his family a bright future. That is why he is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to buy poultry. Through the income that he will generate from poultry farming, he will be able to comfortably assure his child of uninterrupted learning, because he will be able to pay tuition fees and provide all other basic needs that his family may require. Peter is a strong believer that education is the key to success, and that\u2019s why he will do anything positively good to assure his child of a good future.

Meet Patrick, a 37-year-old man who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking man on this planet Earth. Patrick is a father of two lovely children that he really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed on hungry stomachs. Patrick hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya.  Patrick never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white collar job but this did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life.   \r\n\r\nPatrick started farming and has been doing farming for the past 17 years. Through those years he has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Patrick practices mixed farming on his farm and through the profits he has managed to take care of his family's needs and also give his children a good education because he believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success.\u201d  \r\n\r\nPatrick is a man who is very enterprising and he is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Patrick wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits.  \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like Patrick to take their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Patrick hopes that through the loan he will improve his living conditions. Patrick dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year he will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this he will be able to assure his children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because he will be able to pay tuition fees on time. \r\n\r\nPatrick is not a selfish man and also wants to impact society, that is why he will employ people to work for him on his horticulture farm, hence having an impact on

Now, after working in the health and fitness industry for over 20 years, he has decided to provide this opportunity to his community, through his business: XPC Training Systems. XPC is part of a franchise and offers youth and adult training around Brevard County, FL and surrounding area.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel knows there is a demand for his service. XPC recently moved just across the street \u2013 but now is next to a major nationwide gym chain. He says, \u201cIn our new location, we have access to over 6000 members who will use our services for themselves and their children. Our foot traffic has increased over 500% since our relocation!\u201d This surge in clients is great \u2013 but Emmanuel needs to make sure XPC has enough gym equipment to handle these new customers! Emmanuel needs to purchase sleds, kettle bells, training ropes, and medicine balls. He will also use this loan towards marketing.\r\n \r\nEmmanuel is very positive about the future.  \u201cI will grow the business and expand to 2-4 more locations throughout Central Florida in the

Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nAnn finds farming very fulfilling and agrees with the notion that farming is a very profitable business venture, but she constantly faces a challenge of poor productivity on her farm because of a lack of farm inputs. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan, Ann will purchase quality seeds and fertilizer that will increase her production level and this will immediately translate to increased income levels. \r\n\r\nAnn is a very hard-working woman and she believes that, through hard work and honest sweat, her living conditions will permanently change. The extra income she will get will be used to repay the loan and increase her farming.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1731465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm inputs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3184.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3277.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3373.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3573.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3678.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3785.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3896.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4010.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4127.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4247.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4372.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.91},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":7346.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7688.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194676},{"amount":78.01,"local_amount":6686.75,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6997.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262490},{"amount":84.41,"local_amount":7235.02,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":7571.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600795},{"amount":85,"local_amount":7502.27,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7851.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.53,"payment_id":681377649},{"amount":86.98,"local_amount":7962.12,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8332.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.91,"payment_id":711505639},{"amount":92.8,"local_amount":8267.34,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8651.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.65,"payment_id":752110711}],"funded_date":"2014-11-28T00:18:32Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":791880,"name":"D\u00fao Angelica De San Pedro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Angelica de San Pedro La encargada de este grupo es la se\u00f1ora Ang\u00e9lica quien se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos como cremas, talcos, colonias, champo, lociones, perfumes, para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os desde hace dos a\u00f1os.

Elvia was able to study only up to first grade. Her partner makes a living offering private security services in the capital. Only he and her daughters live with her.\r\n\r\nElvia is a homemaker, and her only concern is to ensure that her daughters have everything they need. \r\n\r\nBecause her stove smokes the wooden walls and the roof, which is bad for their health, she was recommended to relocate the stove outside her home. For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy 16 sheets of metal and 4 pounds of nails to build a small room outside her house for the stove.\r\n\r\nElvia dreams about improving the floor in her house and fixing the roof, where she has a water tank. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1725448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy 16 metal sheets and 4 pounds of nails to build a small room to house the stove.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvia Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":29.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":30.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":32.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":34.27},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":37.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.43},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":64.21,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":64.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146115},{"amount":30.37,"local_amount":30.37,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":30.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769632},{"amount":29.23,"local_amount":29.23,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":29.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833261},{"amount":32.57,"local_amount":32.57,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":32.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201021},{"amount":17.61,"local_amount":17.61,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":17.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650536761},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":51.34,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":51.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802673},{"amount":29.79,"local_amount":29.79,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-26T12:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":29.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683482775},{"amount":144.88,"local_amount":144.88,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":144.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696540374}],"funded_date":"2014-12-10T15:41:48Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:12:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":796379,"name":"Asuncion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asuncion is a married woman with ten children.

Therefore Shakeela has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Shakeela's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily, and provide better transport facilities to earn a profitable income.

14 a\u00f1os y una hija de 9 a\u00f1os, y su negocio es la venta de comida t\u00edpica.\nElla es buena madre, independiente, emprendedora, contante, responsable y trabajadora. Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad de \u2018Sacaba\u2019 un lugar caracterizado por aglomerar a restaurantes de comida t\u00edpica y por la elaboraci\u00f3n de la \u2018Chicha\u2019 bebida fermentada de ma\u00edz, de clima semi-tropical, h\u00famedo con un paisaje muy colorido.\nValentina es de tez morena, cabello negro largo trenzado, su forma de vestir es tradicional (sombrero manta y pollera), su lengua materna es el Quechua y habla espa\u00f1ol por el comercio (al centro con una pa\u00f1oleta celeste en la cabeza). Su vida la realiza con su esposo que es chofer y se dedica al transporte, y con sus hijos que estudian en la escuela, viven en una casa propia de ladrillo y tienen electricidad y agua de pozo. La necesidad de ampliar su negocio para generar mejores utilidades la llev\u00f3 a conformar una banca de personas con negocios como; taller de costura, tejidos, venta de pescado, servicio de construcci\u00f3n, elaboraci\u00f3n de colchones, venta de empanadas y comercio de cosm\u00e9ticos, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y prosperar en sus negocios. Su negocio es la venta de comida t\u00edpica de lunes a domingo y el men\u00fa var\u00eda de acuerdo al d\u00eda. Lunes: escabeche (carne de cerdo hervido). Martes: rellenos de papa (masa de papa con relleno de carne molida). Mi\u00e9rcoles: Aj\u00ed de patas (patitas de cerdo con picante). Jueves: Picante mixto (lengua de vaca y pollo todo picante).

Esta es la primera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en diez a\u00f1os que lleva en esta actividad. Su sue\u00f1o es ampliar su negocio teniendo un restaurante propio, ella desea realizar la compra de mesas y sillas para atender a mayor cantidad de clientes y aprovechar las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o.\nEs por esos motivos que Valentina solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mesas y sillas para ampliar su negocio y aprovechar las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o.\n","en":"Valentina, 38, is married and has a son, 14, and a daughter, 9.  She's a good mother and an independent, enterprising, persevering, responsible, and hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling traditional food.  She works in the town of Sacaba, a place known for bringing together traditional restaurants and for making \"chicha,\" a fermented corn beverage.  The area is semitropical and humid, and the landscape is very colorful.\r\n\r\nValentina is dark skinned, wears her long black hair in a braid, and dresses traditionally (hat, shawl, pollera skirt).  (She's in the middle, wearing a light blue kerchief on her head.)  Her native language is Quechua and she speaks Spanish because of her business.  \r\n\r\nShe has made her life with her husband, a driver who earns a living in transportation, and her children, who attend school.  They live in their own house, which is made of brick and has electricity and well water.  The need to earn more profits led her to form a bank with people so they could request a loan and prosper in their businesses: a tailor shop, textiles, fish sales, construction services, mattress production, empanada sales, and cosmetics sales.\r\n\r\nValentina's business is selling traditional food Monday through Sunday, and her menu varies according to the day.  Monday: \"escabeche\" (boiled pork).  Tuesday: \"rellenos de papa\" (potato dough filled with ground meat).  Wednesday: \"aj\u00ed de patas\" (pork leg with hot peppers).  Thursday: \"picante mixto\" (spicy cow tongue and chicken).  Friday: \"pique macho\" (fried potatoes, beef, sausage, and hot peppers).  Saturday: \"lomo borracho\" (beef in wine).  Sunday: \"chicharr\u00f3n de cerdo\" (fried pork meat).  This variety of dishes is customary in her community and her customers are already familiar with her menu.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan sequence with the institution in her 10 years in business.  Her dream is to expand her business with a proper restaurant.  Valentina's requesting a loan because she wants to buy tables and chairs to serve more customers and make the most of the end-of-year festivities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1725424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs to expand her business and make the most of the end-of-year festivities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-13T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-13T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3019.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3039.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3150.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3265},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3383.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3507.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3634.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":439.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":458.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":439.79,"local_amount":3019.47,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3038.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556643},{"amount":442.74,"local_amount":3039.69,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3059.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157332},{"amount":458.85,"local_amount":3150.32,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3170.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554229},{"amount":475.55,"local_amount":3265,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3286.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226770},{"amount":1533.07,"local_amount":10525.52,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10593.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213947}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T22:02:22Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":796446,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita is a married woman with one child who in school.

As he was the oldest child in his family he had to leave in the early morning hours to work the land. He grows 7000 square meters of corn and 3500 of beans. Today he also works on the coffee crops on one of the farms in the area, providing additional income to give his family better living conditions. <br \/><br \/>The loan he seeks is to buy corn for his wife's tortilla business and at the same time he needs to invest in buying two pigs to fatten. With this he will improve their income, as their sales will increase as they have increasing demand.

She started farming 40 years ago, which is around the same time she got married to her septuagenarian husband, Samwel. She keeps three cows and five poultry on the farm that produce milk and eggs for both consumption and sale. She has employed two farmhands to help her run the enterprise.\r\n \r\nEsther is looking to develop the state of the poultry by constructing a housing for the hens. She will then buy more hens to produce more eggs for sale. To actualize this plan, she has turned to Kiva lenders seeking a loan investment of KES 20,000. Any amount spared after this project will help her purchase farm inputs such as fertilizer. \r\n\r\nThrough hardwork and determination, Esther believes that she will one day be able to provide her family with a better quality of life, which is different from the one she grew up in. The increased income will go to her children's education to further their endeavors for a brighter future.

Meet Enosh, a 56-year-old caring, honest and hard-working father of four children, who hails from the Kisii area of Kenya. Enosh is a very hard-working farmer who is easy to get along with. <p>\r\n\r\nHe has been farming for the past ten years. During this time, he has never looked back, because he has been making good profits and taking great strides in terms of farming. Enosh practices mixed farming -- that is, crop and dairy farming -- and, through these ventures, he has been able to earn a decent and honest income. He is an early riser who wakes up very early to go to his farm because farming is the only way that he can earn a living. <p>\r\n\r\nEnosh has identified space on his farm that he wants to fully utilize through dairy farming. This is why he is kindly requesting a loan to buy a dairy cow. Kisii is an area that has a high population and a high demand for milk. Enosh, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that and to be able to earn extra income. He hopes that the extra income generated from the loan proceeds will allow him to improve his family's standard of living and to expand his milk-selling business.

He has worked in farming from a very young age. He managed to study until the 4th grade of middle school education, attending classes at nights because there was a civil war at the time and it was very difficult to study. He got married at the age of 28 and had two daughters and two sons with his wife. He currently receives a state pension because he served during the war.\r\n\r\nToday, Hilario also makes a living as a baker, a trade he learned from a very young age when he undertook a bakery course given by staff at the town council where he lives. As he was very intelligent, he learned the activity very easily and currently makes French bread and sweet bread for sale. However, as demand is so high, he buys bread from another town and resells it in neighbouring areas.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting the loan to buy flour, eggs, butter, and yeast, and to buy pigs, as he has always wanted to work in this activity because if you know how to manage it, it can be highly profitable.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he plans to buy another vehicle as he is unable to meet the demand for bread, and he needs to be able to cover more areas and in this way, make more money for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1725525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

ocho a\u00f1os de edad, y su negocio es la venta de comida.\nElla es fuerte, luchadora, constante, responsable y trabajadora. Su negocio lo realiza en la zona 16 de julio, un lugar c\u00e9ntrico caracterizado por conectar a todas las dem\u00e1s zonas mediante transporte publico de todo tipo. De clima fr\u00edo aproximadamente doce grados cent\u00edgrados durante todo el a\u00f1o y a una altura de 3750 metros sobre el nivel del mar.\nSusy es de tez morena, estatura mediana, cabello negro como la noche; largo y trenzado, su forma de vestir es tradicional (sombrero, manta y pollera), su lengua materna es el aymar\u00e1 y habla espa\u00f1ol por el comercio (sentada, con mand\u00edl rosado). La necesidad por ampliar su negocio la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; puesto de venta de comida, venta de licores, venta de chompas, tejido de ropa de bebe, venta de papas fritas, venta de ropa deportiva y tienda de barrio, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar las utilidades de sus actividades. Su negocio es la venta de comida como; aj\u00ed de papalisa (papalisa, arroz, carne molida y aj\u00ed), anticucho (coraz\u00f3n de res ensartada en un alambre a la parrilla con aj\u00ed de man\u00ed), Chairo (sopa de chu\u00f1o), fricas\u00e9 (sopa de cerdo), peske (quinua con queso y leche), etc. su negocio lo inicio frente a la casa de su madre porque existe una parada de buses y mucho tr\u00e1nsito de personas, ya son cinco a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta labor en el mismo lugar, al aire libre, s\u00f3lo tiene un toldo (sombrilla) que la protege del sol y un poco de la lluvia, adem\u00e1s de media docena de bancos, donde los clientes se sientan para comer agarrando el plato con la mano y una cuchara en la otra. Esta es la primera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n desde que inici\u00f3 su labor. Su sue\u00f1o es tener un restaurante reconocido, ella desea refaccionar un cuarto viejo que consigui\u00f3 en alquiler para utilizarlo como restaurante, este se encuentra en malas condiciones; el techo est\u00e1 da\u00f1ado, le falta revoque en las paredes y tiene ventanas sin vidrios. Es por esos motivos que Susy solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para refaccionar su futuro restaurante y dejar de vender comida en la calle.","en":"Susy is a 34-year-old woman, married, who has three daughters who are fourteen, ten, and eight years old. Her business is selling food.\r\n\r\nShe is strong, persistent, tenacious, responsible, and hard-working. She performs her work in the 16 de Julio zone, a central area characterized by connecting all of the other zones through all types of public transportation. It has a cold climate of approximately twelve degrees Celsius during the whole year and an altitude of 3750 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nSusy is of dark complexion, medium height, with hair black as night, long and braided. Her form of dress is traditional (a hat, blanket, and skirt). Her mother tongue is Aymara, and she speaks Spanish because of her business (seated, with a pink apron). \r\n\r\nThe necessity of increasing her business led her to form a bank made up of people with businesses such as: a stand selling food, selling liquors, selling sweaters, knitting baby clothes, selling French fries, selling sports clothes, and a neighborhood store. This was to request a loan and improve the usefulness of their activities.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling food such as: aj\u00ed de papalisa (papalisa, rice, ground beef, and broth), anticucho (beef heart skewered on a wire, grilled, with peanut broth), Chairo (soup made from freeze-dried potatoes), fricas\u00e9 (pork soup), peske (quinoa with cheese and milk), etc. She began her business in front of her mother\u2019s house because there is a bus stop and a lot of pedestrian traffic. It has already been five years that she has performed this work in the same place, outside. She only has a toldo (parasol) that protects her from the sun and a little from the rain. Also, there are a half-dozen benches where the customers sit to eat, holding the plate with one hand and a spoon in the other.\r\n\r\nThis is the first sequence of loans with the institution since she began her work. Her dream is to have a well-known restaurant. She wishes to remodel an old room that she acquired to rent to use as a restaurant. It is in bad condition: the roof is damaged, it is missing plaster on the walls, and it has windows without glass. It is because of this that Susy is requesting a loan to remodel her future restaurant and stop selling food on the street. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":1725544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to remodel her future restaurant and stop selling food on the street.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-14T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-14T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomas Julian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Secundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salustiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":985.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1535.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1563.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1591.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1620.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1650.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1680.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1711.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1742.15},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1773.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1806.15},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1838.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.73},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":226.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.98},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":142.73,"local_amount":985.23,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":986.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556644},{"amount":448.95,"local_amount":3098.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3102.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157333},{"amount":704.55,"local_amount":4863.21,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4868.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554230},{"amount":491.33,"local_amount":3391.45,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3395.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226771},{"amount":509.37,"local_amount":3516.01,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3519.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213948},{"amount":528.07,"local_amount":3645.11,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3648.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564089}],"funded_date":"2014-11-20T22:56:15Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":796559,"name":"Nh\u00f3m 01 Th\u00f4n 6 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u1ea3i Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. L\u01b0\u1ee1ng works in agriculture raising poultry.

Her family means the world to her. She beganfarming 6 years ago to help her husband provide.  She  has never regretted this decision. Her primary income sources are selling milk and crops.\r\n\r\nThere is in nothing in the world Milka enjoys more than feeding and milking her cows. She loves it because the two activities are interrelated in more ways than meets the eye. She seeks a loan to purchase quality feed for her cow. \r\n\r\nDisease causing germs and parasites are present everywhere. Like humans, animals have an immune system which is usually able to cope with these germs. And as with humans, the efficiency of the immune system will be disturbed if animals are not properly fed. \r\nThe acquired feed will help Milka strike a balance between disease pressure (the presence of germs and parasites) and the resistance (immune system and self-healing forces) of the animal. With your loan, the farmer will influence both sides of this balance: reduce the quantity of germs by maintaining good hygiene, and strengthen the animal's ability to cope with germs through proper feeds.\r\n\r\nThe resulting good health of her animals will boost their milk productivity. Increased income generated will help her settle farm related expenses and pay for tuition fees.

Meet an industrious Kenyan woman from a Kuserwo location, who goes by the name of Mercy. This year, Mercy celebrated her first firstborn son's birthday with her husband, Geoffrey. \r\n\r\nThe lovely couple owns a small-fenced farmland in the acclivitous Cherengany hills. On the farm, they mostly rear livestock. As her family grows bigger, Mercy is constantly looking for more ways to grow her income. \r\n\r\nThe business plan that she is currently working on is venturing into poultry farming. The market for poultry products is there, the space on the farm is sufficient, and the two have been farming long enough to be able to raise chickens. What is missing is the capital to get started. \r\n\r\nMercy is seeking a KES 30,000 loan to purchase a brood of hens to start poultry farming. This venture will enable her, not only to increase her income, but also to manage certain business risks, through product diversification. \r\n\r\nIncome from this investment will generate enough income for the couple to settle their family's basic needs, such as food. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":296.15,"image":{"id":1732003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-14T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-14T17:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.76,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.78,"local_amount":5209.6,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5460.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824076},{"amount":54.45,"local_amount":4667.21,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4892.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264561},{"amount":56.56,"local_amount":4848.24,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5082.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459239},{"amount":58.27,"local_amount":5169.06,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5418.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.04,"payment_id":696587346},{"amount":61.33,"local_amount":5490.03,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5754.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.72,"payment_id":731022460}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T00:10:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":796610,"name":"Johana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wonderful Kiva Lenders! Meet Johana, or better known as \"Johnny,\u201d who is an energetic, brave, and humble man who hails from the Molo area of Kenya - an area that is very fertile and always receives plenty of rainfall.

Through farming, he has been able to take care of his children and family. Johana also does business so that he can make ends meet and increase his profit levels. Through these ventures, he has always brought food back home and earned an honest living. He is a very hardworking man, and sells milk and his produce in the market and also to his neighbors so that he is able to make more money. \r\n\r\nOne challenge that he is currently facing involves getting his products to the market on time. Because of the poor road network and poor feeder roads, the products are no longer fresh when they reach the market. This means that Johana must sell them at a throw-away price, hence not getting maximum profit. Products such as milk, fruits, and vegetables require a timely delivery to market and, for this reason, Johana is seeking a loan of KES 65,000 to buy a motorbike that will assist him in getting his products to market faster. \r\n\r\nHe is sure of reaping more profit because his products will be fresh and will fetch more money. With improved profits, Johana will be able to assure his children of a brighter future and also improve his living conditions. Having gone through and understood the repayment schedule, he is sure that he will be able to repay the loan on time and increase his business in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":521.25,"image":{"id":1732005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike so that he can get his produce to market faster.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Molo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-14T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-14T17:10:04Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.93,"local_amount":10124.32,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10146.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262504},{"amount":111.58,"local_amount":10003.61,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10025.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600808},{"amount":113.47,"local_amount":10458,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10480.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.18,"payment_id":681377662},{"amount":57.48,"local_amount":5494.25,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5506.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.8,"payment_id":711505652},{"amount":51.37,"local_amount":4809.64,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4820.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.28,"payment_id":731022461},{"amount":62.8,"local_amount":5842.35,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5855.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.36,"payment_id":752110721}],"funded_date":"2014-12-13T22:06:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":796601,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is a married woman who has been blessed with three children who attend school.

This is a very common occupation around the town of Kitale where there are not many employment opportunities, and for this reason there is a lot of undertaking and competition in the dairy and poultry farming. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, he has been involved in mixed farming on his small piece of land. His major primary sources of income are egg selling, crops, and some personal business he engages in to make ends meet. He passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, his response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d He sells eggs and poultry products to his neighbors and to the local market, and, because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into his compound and the demand has been overwhelming. \r\n\r\nTo be able to meet the demand, he is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan he will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity and hence satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used in improving his living conditions and he plans on expanding his business to other towns. Other than increased profits he will also benefit from poultry manure which will be used in his vegetable garden to increase productivity.

Rift, Kenya. She started farming roughly two decades ago when she got married to Mr. Kosgei. Her husband owns five acres of land where she keeps cattle and poultry, and grows maize and trees. \r\n\r\nIrene is seeking a loan of 65,000 KES to purchase a water tank. A water tank is quite vital, especially for a farmer doing mixed farming in an area like Cheptarit, characterized by seasonal rainfall. On the farm, she has five cows, 10 chickens, maize, and trees that require a sufficient supply of water throughout the year. This loan investment will allow Irene to store huge volumes of water to be used sparingly during dry seasons. As a result, her animals will stay hydrated and the plants of the farm will grow green and healthy.\r\n \r\nIncome from this investment will enable her to raise her children better and pay for their tuition fees.

As in other businesses, transportation is a phase in the production process which is not complete until the commodity is in the hands of the final consumers. \r\n\r\nStephen, 35, lives with his family on a small piece of land in Kapsowar. The region is popular for growing maize as a staple food. Stephen had been engaged in farming--keeping poultry and dairy cows--for not less than five years, when he saw a big gap and seized the opportunity. The road networks in Kapsowar have been terrible since time immemorial. The road situation has forced farmers to sell their produce within their environs at a low price because of surplus supply. Roads to the farm can hardly be accessed by motor vehicles. \r\n\r\nStephen purchased an ideal Indian motorcycle with low fuel consumption, low maintenance costs and a great deal of flexibility. With this machine, he was able to transport his milk and eggs to a distant market with fair prices, as well as offer transportation services to pedestrians along the way when he was returning. He saw a bigger potential in helping other farmers transport their produce and sell it at a better market price. Stephen is seeking a loan to purchase more motorcycles. This will enable him to fill the demand for his services as well as offer employment to others in his community.

Meet Simon, one of the most hardworking men on earth. He is 42 years of age, very hardworking, and a go-getter. He is a proud father of three lovely children. He hails from Igoki, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and, to survive, you must have tough skin. Simon has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past 20 years. His primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. Simon passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cMutune\u201d (meaning brown). Whenever he is milking his cow, he feels proud. \r\n\r\nHe is contented with the farming way of life. His biggest challenge in farming is irrigating his farm. He is requesting a loan to buy a generator that he will use to pump water from the river to his farm. Irrigation is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and re-vegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall.

Meet Daniel, a very hardworking, energetic and honest man who is 23 years of age. He lives in the rich highlands of Molo with his family. Daniel has been practicing farming for the past five years. Through those years, he has been able to support his family. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs, and crop farming. \r\n\r\nThe Molo area is populated and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Daniel's biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. Poultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya, and one doesn\u2019t need to be a large scale farmer to benefit from it. Through the loan, Daniel will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market. The demand for chicken is always high, it being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in his area. \r\n\r\nDaniel has been facing challenges accessing finances, but he feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Daniel chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rates on the their loans are low and on a reducing basis. Daniel underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through the loan, Daniel's income will increase and his life will permanently change, leading to better living conditions for his family and a positive impact to the community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1732066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Molo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-14T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-14T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.03,"local_amount":3469.08,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3506.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262508},{"amount":34.16,"local_amount":3036.23,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3069.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600812},{"amount":35.07,"local_amount":3204.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3238.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.98,"payment_id":681377666},{"amount":47.41,"local_amount":4493.64,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4542.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.14,"payment_id":711505656},{"amount":62.84,"local_amount":5796.73,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5859.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"payment_id":752110723}],"funded_date":"2014-11-20T13:30:56Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":791977,"name":"Rosario Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosario  de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada y tiene 3 hijos de 7, 6 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta 3\u00b0 grado de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, dejo la escuela por ayudar a sus padres con los gastos de la casa trabajando.

Meet Jackson, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 33-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner for his family, with a wife and one children, he farms a small plot of land in the green lush hills of Nkubu in the central region of Kenya.  For the past 16 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop selling.  He is also engaged in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. \r\n\r\nJackson passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter and another quality-breed dairy cow. The chaff cutter will assist Jackson in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to feed his cows. Also, it will aid the animals' digestion and prevent the animals from rejecting any part of their food.  Jackson also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality-breed cow that will be producing between 15-25 litres of milk a day.  The selling price for milk is 40 Kenyan shillings per liter and through this loan, he will be making a cool US $11 per day. \r\n\r\nBefore Jackson joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, Jackson now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Jackson will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows, and through this loan Jackson will achieve this.  An increase in income will allow Jackson to improve his living conditions and secure the future for his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Jackson fears that his dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide their reliable market channel, credit facility and services that he requires to grow his dairy enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1732116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy a chaff cutter and a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-14T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-14T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":796721,"name":"Rabih","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rabih is a 36-year-old married father of two children.
