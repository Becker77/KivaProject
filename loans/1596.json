Meet Wilita, a 49-year-old jovial mother of five lovely children whom she refers to as her \u201cheartbeat\u201d. Wilita hails from the Nandi Hills area of Kenya, a place that has produced some top elite athletes for the world who have broken world records in the Olympics. Nandi Hills has good weather patterns that favor tea and dairy farming. \r\n\r\nWilita is a very hardworking woman who enjoys farming, which she has been doing on her small piece of land for the past 25 years. Through all those years, she has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in her village. Because of the immense knowledge that she has of farming, Wilita offers extension services to other farmers who are new in the business. \r\n\r\nBeing a caring and loving mother, Wilita has been able to take care of her family and support them through the profits she has earned from farming. Although Wilita reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing that is dragging her behind and preventing her from \u201creaching on top of the skies\u201d is lack of enough land to farm. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Wilita is seeking a loan of KES 60,000 to be able to buy a piece of land and expand her farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Wilita is sure that she will make good use of the land and double her profit levels. \r\n\r\nThrough the profits, she would be able to repay the loan and improve her living conditions. Wilita is sure that if you invest in her, she will be able to realize her dream of having a good-quality life and securing her children's future. Wilita has gone through the repayment schedule and amount, and is comfortable with the plan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":613.78,"image":{"id":1732098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a piece of land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-14T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-14T22:30:06Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.35,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.11,"local_amount":10409.51,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10522.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194694},{"amount":100.83,"local_amount":8962.6,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":9059.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262510},{"amount":39.28,"local_amount":3491.83,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3529.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600814},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":3342.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3378.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459244},{"amount":88.74,"local_amount":8108.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8196.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.48,"payment_id":681377668},{"amount":48.37,"local_amount":4449.36,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4497.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.69,"payment_id":696587349},{"amount":18.95,"local_amount":1796.64,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1816.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.26,"payment_id":711505659},{"amount":32.88,"local_amount":3052.69,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3085.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":731022464},{"amount":118.67,"local_amount":10944.9,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":11063.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.46,"payment_id":752110725}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T16:02:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":796949,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is 49 years old and married with four children.

There will be fewer flies and bad smells around the piles of waste close to the house, and no more trees will be cut down to supply the family with wood.\r\n\r\nThis loan represents 16% of the cost of the biodigester, while the remaining amount is covered by a government subsidy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1732399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to purchase a 6 cubic meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Amealco de Bonfil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2014-11-14T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-14T23:00:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicasio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3012,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3012}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":502,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":509.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595313282},{"amount":36.21,"local_amount":502,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":509.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.29,"payment_id":624387810},{"amount":148.47,"local_amount":2008,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-22T12:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2039.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"payment_id":649726182}],"funded_date":"2014-11-15T12:51:50Z","paid_date":"2015-05-22T12:13:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":796945,"name":"Rene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rene is from Plaridel.

Bruno needs a loan to purchase more inventory. In the future, Bruno plans on hiring a few more employees, as well as expanding his warehouse space. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1716260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fire security inventory to ensure a steady supply of high demand items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Pennsylvania","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":5425,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bruno","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5415,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":187.73},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":203.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":210.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":207.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":212.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":212.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":218.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":220.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":224.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":225.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":229.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":231.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":234.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":238.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":239.7},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":243.13},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":245.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":248.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":251.31},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":254.3},{"due_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":257.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":226.35},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.14},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.77},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":258.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":796994,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma, 36, is married and has five children.

She is married to Freddie, a barangay kagawad (elected government official). They have five children; one is in college, two are in high school, and two are in elementary level. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her four children to school. <br \/><br \/>Aileen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells fish and has a boarding house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 3000 a day. <br \/><br \/>To help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh fish, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. Part of the loan she will also use for repair of her rooms for rent.  She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings is their source for meeting their daily expenses and sending her children to school. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.<br \/><br \/>Aileen hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they could have a better life. She strives so hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1732468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

married, and a mother of four children.  She grew up in a rural area, where she helped her parents raise livestock and grow fruits and vegetables as a child.  These days, she earns her living selling kitchenware from a shop she rents at a marketplace.

Meet David, a 47-year-old father of four adorable children that always bring a pleasant feeling when they are all at home. He hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area that is a city of champions because of producing so many elite athletes. \r\n\r\nBeing a father of four comes with lots of responsibility, and feeding this large family requires a lot of hard work; hence, David has to put in extra efforts to comfortably take care of his family. David started farming just after finishing high school since he never advanced his education. Because of the high unemployment rate, he ventured into farming, and he has never regretted this because of the profits he has been making. \r\n\r\nDavid practices mixed farming and is regarded as one of the hardworking farmers in his village because he is able to juggle between keeping dairy cows and also doing crop farming. David is a visionary and enterprising person and has always wanted to do dairy farming on a large scale, but one of the challenges he has faced is lack of enough capital. That is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan David is confident that his life will be transformed and his dream of providing a secure future for his children will be achieved. David is relieved to know that his life can be secured through partners such as Kiva lenders who help small-scale and aspiring men such as David."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":431.69,"image":{"id":1732638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T06:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T06:00:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.69,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41365,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2927.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3013.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3101.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3191.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3285.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3381.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3479.86},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3581.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3686.23},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3793.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3904.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4018.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.64,"local_amount":3452.29,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3561.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194697},{"amount":37.68,"local_amount":3281.2,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824088},{"amount":46.96,"local_amount":4089.11,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4218.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262513},{"amount":41.08,"local_amount":3577.64,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3691.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264567},{"amount":41.42,"local_amount":3606.89,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3721.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600817},{"amount":50.36,"local_amount":4385.63,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4524.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459246},{"amount":81.66,"local_amount":7361.18,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7594.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.87,"payment_id":696587351},{"amount":86.2,"local_amount":7839.02,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8087.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.82,"payment_id":731022466}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T23:22:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":797092,"name":"Sreypich's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sreypich, a mother of three schoolchildren, is 34 years old and a villager from Kampong Cham province.

The lady standing first from the left, raising her hand in the photo, is Kamini. She is 46 years old, living with her husband and two daughters aged 12 and 18 years old. She belongs to a Below Poverty Line family (BPL), a segment living on less than a dollar a day. \r\n\r\nKamini is doing vegetable vending with the support of her husband. She is selling vegetables at her home, whereas her husband moves around to all weekly markets to sell vegetables. Kamini herself started this enterprise five years ago on a small scale and has been working hard to grow her business. Her family earns a monthly income of 6,500\/- INR which is scarcely enough to manage the family with educational, domestic and business expenses.\r\n\r\n Due to lack of finances, Kamini is not able to complete the construction of her house. So she is planning to expand her business. From the present loan she will purchase a stock of brinjal (eggplant), tomatoes, green chili, ginger, garlic, curly flower, cabbage, carrots, cucumbers and all green vegetables with a large quantity of potatoes and onions. Kamini dreams of completing the construction of her house and giving better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other twelve members of the group are doing vegetable vending, fast food, fish business, fruit business, chicken center, and puffed rice businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1732562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a stock of brinjal (eggplant), tomatoes, green chili, ginger, garlic, curly flower, cabbage, carrots, cucumbers and all green vegetables with a large quantity of potatoes and onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bissum Cuttack,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanaka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manjula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rashmirani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surabhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhagyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tiki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":797202,"name":"Sambedana Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Smita, along with nine other women, is a member of Sambedna SHG, which is situated at Koraput district of Odisha, India.

At present there are 11 members in the group and all of them are very active and very interested in SHG activities. \r\n\r\nManjulata is a member of this group who wanted to start a small business to support her family, as she belongs to a  very poor family where she has hardly any savings. Her family income was a mere 2,000 INR per month which was not sufficient to survive. But after associating with the SHG she started saving regularly and got into a milk-made food business, so that she can contribute some financial support to reduce the poverty level of her family and increase the standard of living.  \r\n\r\nManjulata started cooking food and selling it from her home. She was encouraged by the demand for her tasty food from neighbors.  And also she has a very good relationship with her customers because she cares about the quality and also about satisfying her customers' demand. Day by day her customers are increasing but she does not have proper resources to expand her business so,she thought of renting a shop in a nearby market and also wanted to buy some utensils. For that reason,  she, along with her group, has requested for a loan so that they can invest in their businesses to increase their business activities.

Her husband is also supporting the business by selling the leaf plates in nearby villages. \r\n\r\nInitially, Archana started this business with a small investment of her own. When Mahashakti Foundation started working in her village she motivated eight other women entrepreneurs and formed a group named \u201cJalakanya - 2\u201d and took a loan for the development of their businesses.\r\n \r\nNow Archana\u2019s income is 5,800\/- INR per month, but it is not at all sufficient to meet the household expenses. So for further development she will take another loan. From this loan she will purchase sugar, tea, dry milk and a big stock of leaves for stitching leaf plates. Archana hopes to construct a permanent cabin for her business and a good house for her family. \r\n\r\nThe other eight members are doing dairy, vegetable vending, leaf plates and fast food stall businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1732803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase sugar, tea, dry milk and a big stock of leaves for stitching leaf plates","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bissum Cuttack,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T18:00:05Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ambadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Archana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gouri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Krishna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minadei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pramila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subhadra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":94000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":792145,"name":"Tomasa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Tomasa es un responsable ama de casa que vive con su pareja con la cual tiene 4 hijos, en busca de mejorar su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica Tomasa decidi\u00f3 optar por el emprendimiento y montar un negocio de venta de comidas por lo cual solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar insumos como vegetales.

Meet Rachael from the Kerugoya area of Kenya, a woman from a community not known for farming, but she is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married, and together with her husband, is blessed with two lovely children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, she has been practicing mixed farming, and, because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and she is regarded as a mentor. Income from milk, eggs, and maize selling have allowed her to earn a decent income. To make the extra coin, Rachael engages in a small personal business. \r\n\r\nRachael passionately loves dairy farming and animals on her farm have been given names. Milking and feeding Browny (the name of her cow) makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers, then she can SMS her customers when the milk is ready for collection. Because of using information technology, she has had a comparative edge in her dairy business. \r\n\r\nDemand has been overwhelming, and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand. She is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Rachael does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow, but she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate to more income, and Rachael will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going children. \r\n\r\nWhen anybody listens to Rachael speak, one would be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming, but because of passion and determination she intends to beat all odds. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Rachael, and there is no doubt that you can find rewarding employment in dairy farming."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1732840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T18:30:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4416.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4678.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4814.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4955.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5100.39},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5249.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5402.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5560.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5723.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5890.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6062.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100.57,"local_amount":8965.28,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":9056.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194698},{"amount":139.04,"local_amount":12394.86,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":12520.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262514},{"amount":42.19,"local_amount":3760.63,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3798.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600818},{"amount":42.46,"local_amount":3784.71,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3823.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459247},{"amount":63.9,"local_amount":5842.59,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5902.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.64,"payment_id":681377671},{"amount":58.65,"local_amount":5399.62,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5454.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":696587352},{"amount":57.33,"local_amount":5436.38,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5491.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.66,"payment_id":711505662},{"amount":181.02,"local_amount":16815.93,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":16987.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.62,"payment_id":731022467}],"funded_date":"2014-11-16T21:47:05Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":797254,"name":"Pascasie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pascasie is 41 years old.

Su vida la realiza con su pareja que se dedica al comercio de verduras, su hijo que estudia en la escuela y su peque\u00f1o beb\u00e9 que esta a su cuidado. Sus ganas de independizarse y tener un negocio estable la hicieron formar una banca de personas con negocios como; carnicer\u00eda, tienda de v\u00eddeos, venta de s\u00e1ndwiches, artesan\u00eda en yeso, venta de refrescos, librer\u00eda y venta de ropa, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y mejorar sus negocios.

Tambi\u00e9n mide y mezcla ingredientes, utilizando b\u00e1sculas y jarras medidoras, prepara platos para servir, prepara comida simple como salsas, s\u00e1ndwiches, sopas, postres, etc. Controla las existencias e informa al supervisor cuando se necesite hacer m\u00e1s pedidos, desempaqueta y almacena las existencias en congeladores, armarios y otras \u00e1reas de almacenaje. Mantiene limpia la zona de trabajo (limpiando las superficies de trabajo, los utensilios, los armarios y el equipo de cocina). Mantiene limpia la cocina (barriendo y fregando suelos y sacando la basura). Y escurre y lava los platos y los coloca en el sitio adecuado (en armarios, cajones, etc.). Esta labor la viene realizando hace dos a\u00f1os, y ella piensa que ya es hora de abrir su propio negocio. Esta es la segunda secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n. Su sue\u00f1o es que su hijo tenga buenas oportunidades escolares y laborales. Ella desea independizarse y abrir su propio restaurante y necesita realizar la compra de mesas y sillas para atender a clientes en un lugar cercano a la plaza principal al aire libre.\nEs por esos motivos que Maria solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mesas y sillas para independizarse y tener su propio negocio.","en":"Maria is a 30-year-old woman, who lives with her partner and has an eight-year-old son and a 10-month-old baby. She makes a living as a kitchen assistant.\r\n\r\nShe is resourceful, persevering, optimistic, responsible, hardworking, and a good mother. \r\n\r\nShe works in El Torno\u2014an agricultural area known for its warm tropical climate, with temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius year round, and for being a place that connects farmers with wholesale vendors. The most in-demand agricultural products are meat, grains, vegetables, and fruit. \r\n\r\nMaria is of medium height, has a tan complexion, and wears her long black hair tied up. Her mother tongue is Quechua and speaks Spanish as her second language. She lives with her partner, who makes a living selling vegetables; her son, who goes to school; and her little baby, who is under her care. (In the picture, she is the one sitting with a baby in her arms.)\r\n\r\nHer eagerness to become independent and have a firmly established business made her put together a communal bank of people in order to request a loan and improve their businesses, which are running a butcher\u2019s shop, running a video store, selling sandwiches, making plaster handicrafts, selling beverages, running a bookstore, and selling clothes.\r\n\r\nMaria works as a kitchen assistant and is in charge of helping out the staff of a known restaurant. She prepares dishes and meals, cleans the kitchen, washes and peels fruits and vegetables, slices bread and cuts meat. She also measures and mixes the ingredients, using scales and measuring cups; gets the dishes ready for serving; and prepares simple foods such as salsas, sandwiches, soups, desserts, and the like. She manages the inventory and informs the supervisor when it's time to reorder more supplies; unpacks and stores products in the freezers, pantries, and other storage areas. She keeps the work area clean by washing the work surfaces, kitchen utensils, cupboards, and kitchen equipment. She keeps the kitchen clean by sweeping and mopping the floors and taking the garbage out. She washes and dries dishes and puts them away in the appropriate place (cupboards, drawers, and the like). \r\n\r\nShe has been following this occupation for the last two years, and she thinks that it's time to start her own business. She wants to become independent and open her own restaurant, and she needs to buy tables and chairs to set up an area in an open space close to the main square to serve her customers.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maria is requesting a loan to buy tables and chairs to start her own business and become independent.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan cycle with the institution. Her dream is for her son to have a good education and good job opportunities \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1725574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs to start her own business and become independent.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laurent Arian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2153.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2284.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2367.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2453.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2542.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2635.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2731.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2830.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":643.53,"local_amount":4438.2,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4446.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157334},{"amount":343.28,"local_amount":2367.45,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2372.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554231},{"amount":355.77,"local_amount":2453.62,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2458.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226772},{"amount":368.73,"local_amount":2542.94,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2547.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213949},{"amount":382.15,"local_amount":2635.49,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2640.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564090},{"amount":806.54,"local_amount":5562.3,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5573.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046087}],"funded_date":"2014-12-07T12:12:48Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":797267,"name":"Maximila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maximila is a married woman.

Meet Philip, who was born in the outskirts of Litein, Kenya, and is said to have entered the world smiling. Life for Philip and others in his rural farming village was challenging, requiring families to rely on ingenuity and perseverance in the face of few resources. Philip lives together with his wife, to whom he has been married for over 20 years! His marriage has been blessed with four children, the youngest being 7 and the oldest being 23. \r\n\r\nPhilip has been doing mixed-farming for over five years. He considers himself to be more passionate and hardworking than other farmers. He also leaves nothing to chance when carrying out his duties.\r\n\r\nPhilip is seeking a KES 100,000 loan to purchase farm equipment. Acquisition of these assets is aligned to his plan of growing his agribusiness to the next level. On his farm, he grows maize and also keeps dairy cows. He also keeps ten hens and sheep. For the past few years, his biggest challenge has been the tools used on the farm. They are outdated and worn out, to say the least. As a result, farm work has become strenuous and time consuming. He spends more resources on labor, since working with these tools requires a lot of effort, yet the quality of work keeps deteriorating. \r\n\r\nPhilip is going to use this loan to purchase modern farm equipment that will bring effectiveness and efficiency to his farm work. New improved tools will not only save him on labor costs, but will also improve the quality of the work. With your loan, he will grow his business to greater heights and elevate his family's livelihood.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1732793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase farm implements ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5407.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5565.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5727.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5895.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6067.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6244.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6427.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6615.31},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6808.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7007.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7212.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7423.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7640.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7863.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":8093.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":797274,"name":"Felanzia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felanzia is a married woman and she has three children.

Suwartha sells items like rice, potatoes, onions, garlic, biscuits, locally made shakes, soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. in her shop. She started the business with a small investment of her own. Presently, she is earning a monthly income of 5,000 INR. As per the statement of Suwartha, this small income is not at all sufficient to manage the family along with the educational expenses of her children.  So she wants to increase her income by expanding her existing business. She motivated other women of her village and formed a group of four women to take a new loan. With the present loan, she will purchase items like rice, wheat, oil, soap, potato, onion, etc. for her general store. She will also purchase leaves for making leaf plates. She hopes that this loan will help her to increase her income and make savings so  she will be able to construct a house for her family as well as a permanent cabin for her business. The other three members of the group do businesses like a grocery shop, vegetable vending and leaf plate business.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1732843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase items like rice, wheat, oil, soap, potatoes, and onions for her general store.

She is a 28-year-old mother, who lives with her family in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. She is blessed with two lovely children who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide them a better future. Philisilla was unable to study to get a professional career, because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past five years. She is an early riser who goes to her farm to earn a living. Philisilla has space on her farm and wants to increase her dairy farming, but the major challenge she faces is lack of feed. \r\n\r\nShe is kindly requesting for a loan to buy animal feed. Kerugoya is an area that has a high population and there is a high demand for milk. Philisilla, being an enterprising person, wants to take full advantage of that need and earn extra income. She hopes that this loan will allow her buy animal feed, which will assist in increasing the quantity of milk being produced by her cow. \r\n\r\nPhilisilla plans to open a very large milk-selling business in the nearby shopping center and to package milk.
