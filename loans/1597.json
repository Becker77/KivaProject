There is a large demand for her ecologically clean and delicious products, and they bring her a monthly income of around 10,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business she approached the Bai-Tushum Bank for a 100,000 som (KGS) loan to buy a cow and calf.

He stayed in school through high school, studying accounting, and he did it through much effort, given that he comes from a family with few economic resources. He worked for about seven months in a store, an opportunity he took advantage of to later open his own store in the place where he lives. He is single but very hardworking--besides the store he supports his parents in their agricultural jobs (growing corn and beans). For several years now he has had the store that supports his family, which he began with little and which is now well-stocked.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is for purchasing a mill. In the group of houses where he lives, there is none and people from there have to walk a long way to other groups of houses to break up their corn.\r\n\r\nThis economic aid will help him a lot. He believes it will improve the family's economic situation. His future plans are to plant a plot of land with corn and to improve his house, because the one that he has is made of adobe and it is not in good

When asked about his goals, Ayuba expressed a desire to use the extra income to build a better home, and in the long run, become the most profitable farmer in his community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1661433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to meet expenses like food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayuba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":29953,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":29953}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-17T13:50:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hannah Piedt","image":null}},{"id":792613,"name":"Virgen Del Rosario Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Virgen Del Rosario forma parte del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, donde las se\u00f1oras se ayudan por salir adelante.

farmer who has two children and lives in the village of Kutus in the Kerugoya area of Kenya. As a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Furaha self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor the past year, Millicent has been actively involved in mixed farming, and because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a setback because Millicent has been making great profits in farming. \r\n\r\nKerugoya is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Millicent has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. \r\n\r\nThrough the Furaha self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Millicent joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money. \r\n\r\nThis loan will improve Millicent's living conditions and secure the future of her children"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":669.58,"image":{"id":1732985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticultural farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.16,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Millicent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.98,"local_amount":10577.69,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10624.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194700},{"amount":84.64,"local_amount":7587.99,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":7621.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262515},{"amount":84.34,"local_amount":7561.53,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7594.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264569},{"amount":86.02,"local_amount":7712.11,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7746.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459249},{"amount":61.32,"local_amount":5639.13,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5663.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.58,"payment_id":681377672},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":8874.01,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8913.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.14,"payment_id":696587353},{"amount":129.28,"local_amount":12078.13,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":12131.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.44,"payment_id":731022468}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T20:31:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":797346,"name":"Orwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Orwa is a 22-year-old single man, one of 6 members in his family.

She is single and has a 1-year-old son. Her business is selling breakfasts and dinners. She is optimistic, enterprising, responsible, hard-working, and a good mother. She operates her business in the \u2018Mutualista\u2019 zone, a place located in the center of the city, surrounded by offices and businesses. The temperature there is approximately 30 degrees Centigrade throughout the year. \r\n\r\nJeniffer is of medium height, with brown skin and long braided black hair. She has a robust physical appearance. Her mother tongue is Spanish, but she also speaks Quechua because of her family heritage. (She is seated at the left, wearing a light blue shirt.) Together with her little child, she lives in her parents' house, which is made of brick, with water and electricity. Thinking about her young son's future, she looked for people with businesses such as selling cell phone cases, selling coca on a retail basis, selling quinoa juice, selling perfumes, selling soft drinks, selling traditional skirts, and selling ice cream, to form a communal bank and apply for a loan to improve their economic activities. (The group previously was made up of other people.) \r\n\r\nHer business is selling breakfasts and dinners. The breakfast consists of a glass of Api (ground purple corn), accompanied by cu\u00f1ap\u00e9s (baked corn flour with cheese). The dinner varies according to the inventory of her cupboard, and it may be: masaco de yuca (yuca boiled with dried meat and salt), masaco de pl\u00e1tano (plantains boiled with dried meat and salt), tamales a la olla (boiled corn dough with a cheese filling), tamales al horno (baked corn dough with a cheese filling), or zonzos en pacumuto (grilled ground yuca with cheese). \r\n\r\nShe does this work from Monday through Friday, and the rest of the time she is occupied with her little son. This is the second loan sequence with the institution in the three years during which she has been doing this work. Her dream is to become established in the area and become the most preferred business among her customers. She wants to buy cooking supplies on a wholesale basis, due to the difficulty of transportation with her baby, to ensure that she does not run out of ingredients for cooking. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Jeniffer is requesting a loan to buy cooking supplies on a wholesale basis, so that she does not have to travel as often with her baby, for better safety.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1725679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients wholesale so she doesn't have to travel as often with her baby, for better safety.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-15T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-15T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelo Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ignacio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Noelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Gravi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeniffer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia Maruja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2996.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3081.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3169.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3259.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3352.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3447.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3545.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3646.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":460.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":473.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":515.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":792572,"name":"Vilma Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El humo que despega del asador, se logra identificar a larga distancia,  desde carne, pollo o cerdo, podr\u00e1s encontrar en el negocio de Vilma, adem\u00e1s de ser un negocio que le ha ayudado financieramente, ha podido cumplir sus metas que son seguir ofertando su comida, que ahora es muy conocida, y hasta de punto de referencia, donde las personas llegan a degustar la cuchara de Vilma.

He will now be able to replace all these polluting and unhealthy energy sources and fertilizers with renewable energy and the nutrient-rich natural fertilizer produced from his animals' waste.

From these results, Ni Kadek paid off the previous loan to MUK of 1,200,000 IDR and then she and the group of Sombang Lestari requested a new loan to MUK.\r\n\r\nThese loans are very necessary to increase business capital of pigs, so they can supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nNi Kadek's daily activities are only as a laborer with her husband. Ni Kadek and some friends formed a group of pig farmers that have been running for ten periods. With the help of venture capital loans from MUK of 1,200,000 IDR per member, Ni Kadek formed Sombang Lestari group and she became its group leader.\r\n\r\nNi Kadek will use this loan to buy three local piglets for fattening, each 400,000 IDR. Ni Kadek buys feed with her own money. Ni Kadek hopes that during the next six months, the pigs will grow well and increase the results of their sale.\r\n\r\nObviously the results obtained will be used to meet the cost of living as well as their children's school fees. Support from her husband also encouraged Ni Kadek to work hard with the pig livestock business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1733297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy three local piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2014-11-16T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-16T03:20:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":12000000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":12220794.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665089030}],"funded_date":"2014-11-17T20:21:11Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:55:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":797560,"name":"Vicky","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicky is 60 years old, married, and lives in Poblacion, Sibutad, Philippines.

My parents works as laborers in the fields, and their earnings are minimal. Sometimes the weather also affects my parents' income as if the weather is bad, the harvest can be very small. Even if the rice fields are flooded, there can be crop failure, and then my parents do not make any money. To overcome this, my father also works as a construction worker in the city, so for several months I have to be apart from him. I am very sad, seeing my father struggle just to pay for my school, but it is my father's wish that I follow higher education. Through the Kiva program at the Academy of Maritime Nusantara (AMN), I am applying for this loan to finance my college education at AMN for 3 years. These loans can ease the burden on my parents.

This new loan will go to additional stock of different undergarments. Her customers will likely buy more items if she has more products displayed in her store.

She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nEditha operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also has a tricycle unit for transport service which her husband drives for added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 1000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, charcoal, sodas and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nEditha hopes to maintain and grow her business so she can have a better life.

Her business is the sale of fried fish. She is enterprising, steadfast, responsible, a good mother and worker. She carries out her business in the market of the 'cruce Villa Aldea' zone, a place strategically characterized by connecting various zones of the city by all types of transport, where the people agglomerate to find transit to their homes, a zone of cold and dry climate at an elevation of 3800 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nTeresa is of dark complexion, long black hair, short stature, her native tongue is Aymar\u00e1 and she speaks Spanish according to the language of her customers (in the middle standing, whole red sweater). She carries out her life with her husband who is an electrician and works in a business of such. Their son studies the technical career of nursing at the university. All live in a halfway-constructed house of brick and adobe. They have water, electricity and gas.\r\n\r\nThe need of improving their quality of life led her to form a bank of people with businesses like: clothing sale, sale of fruit, sale of tomatoes, knit garments, sale of fish, construction service and sale of empanadas in order to apply for a loan and fulfill their goals. Her business is the sale of fried fish, an activity that she's been developing since 8 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt's already midmorning and the passersby of the zone start to smell the delicious aroma of fried fish coming from the market. More than one can't achieve resisting his appetite and they come up to the stall to order a plate of food from her. The place is small, it has two tables that are always found full, but in order to satisfy her customers, she has various benches to sit down and eat. In one hand they hold the plate and with the other, the spoon. There isn't a lack of customers who eat standing up for lack of seats. Finally the day finishes; she washes the pots, puts away her utensils and heads to her home. Her house is cozy, she has a dog that waits for her at the door. The rainy season is getting close and the roof is found ill-fated, water leaks and this floods on top of the furniture, the bed and all of her home.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to finish the construction of her home and she wishes to carry out an investment in repairing her roof and the wall of her house. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the eight years that she's been developing this activity.\r\n\r\nIt's for these reasons that Tereza applies for a loan for the repair of her home and to be able to sleep without water leaks."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":1725669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to repair her home and be able to sleep without water leaks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-16T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-16T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":4350,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tereza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovana Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4113.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4017.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4131.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4249.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4494.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4622.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":596.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":582.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":599.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":616.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":633.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":651.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":670.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":596.5,"local_amount":4113.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4121.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556646},{"amount":582.52,"local_amount":4017.39,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4025.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157336},{"amount":599.1,"local_amount":4131.74,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4139.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554234},{"amount":616.16,"local_amount":4249.36,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4257.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226775},{"amount":1285.44,"local_amount":8865.07,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8881.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213952},{"amount":670.28,"local_amount":4622.66,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4631.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564093}],"funded_date":"2014-11-21T14:04:16Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":792693,"name":"Magdalena Salome","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Salome es una joven casada, tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la casa de su padre con su esposo, su hija de 6 a\u00f1os y esta esperando el nacimiento de su bebe, Salome esta estudiando y para apoyar  a su esposo en los gastos del hogar se dedica a la comercializaci\u00f3n de ropa, el cr\u00e9dito lo va a invertir en la compra de ropa comenta que su aspiraci\u00f3n es seguir adelante con su negocio y tener alg\u00fan ahorro para la llegada de su bebe y para darle lo que su hija necesita para que siga estudiando.","en":"Salome is a young married woman.

She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal, household needs and to send her three children to school. \r\n\r\nArmie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers.

She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also has a tricycle unit for a transport service which her husband drives as added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help Armie continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings provide their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nArmie hopes to maintain and grow her business so she that they will have a better life. She strives to give her children the best education and prays for a quiet and happy life.

hijos de catorce, diez, ocho y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, y su negocio es la panader\u00eda.\nElla es trabajadora, responsable, constante, buena madre, y emprendedora. Su trabajo lo realiza en la zona sur de su ciudad, un lugar de clima c\u00e1lido tropical muy h\u00famedo con una temperatura constante de 30 grados aproximadamente durante todo el a\u00f1o y que re\u00fane una vez al a\u00f1o cerca a mil artesanos en la denominada feria de \u2018la Alasita\u2019 d\u00f3nde se oferta todo tipo de bienes en miniatura con el fin de que esa miniatura se materialice y se haga realidad (la creencia dice que se compran sue\u00f1os para que se hagan realidad, por ejemplo: un auto en miniatura se materializa \u2013al pasar un a\u00f1o- en un autom\u00f3vil de verdad).\nMelfy es de tez morena, cabello negro largo, su lengua materna es el espa\u00f1ol y habla guaran\u00ed por herencia familiar (sentada al centro, camisa a rayas celeste). Su vida la comparte con su pareja que se dedica al comercio y sus cuatro hijos, tres estudian en la escuela y el menor se encuentra a su cuidado, viven en una casa propia de ladrillo que cuenta con agua potable y electricidad. Gracias a su impulso de superaci\u00f3n reuni\u00f3 a personas con necesidades similares y negocios como; venta de cubiertas de celulares, venta de hoja de coca, venta de jugo de quinua, venta de perfumes, venta de refrescos, venta de polleras y venta de helado, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y ampliar sus negocios. Su negocio es la panader\u00eda, y sus variedades son; pan de arroz, pan de ma\u00edz, el cu\u00f1ap\u00e9, el sonso, que forman parte de los t\u00edpicos \u201chorneaos\u201d de la gastronom\u00eda oriental.

Su sue\u00f1o es tener una panader\u00eda amplia y surtida. Ella desea realizar la compra de diferentes harinas (trigo, ma\u00edz, arroz, etc.) por mayor, para adelantarse a las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o, donde las ventas aumentan. Esta es la primera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en seis meses que lleva como panadera independiente (antes trabajaba como ayudante en una panader\u00eda grande).\nEs por esos motivos que Melfy solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de harina por mayor para complacer a sus clientes con sus exquisitos horneados.\n","en":"Melfy is a 32-year-old woman. She lives with her partner and has four children of ages 14, 10, 8, and 5. Her business is baking. She is hardworking, responsible, persistent, a good mother, and entrepreneurial. \r\n\r\nShe does her work in the southern part of the city \u2013 a place with a hot, very humid climate, and a constant temperature of approximately 30\u00ba during the entire year.  In this area, once a year, about a thousand artisans meet in the trade fair called \u201cla Alasita.\u201d At the fair, all kinds of miniature goods are sold, with the goal being that the miniature will be brought to life and become reality. (The belief is that at the fair you buy dreams so that they become reality. For example, a miniature car materializes \u2013 after a year \u2013 in a real car.) \r\n\r\nMelfy has dark skin and long black hair. Her native language is Spanish, and she also speaks Guarani because of her family heritage. (In the picture, she is sitting in the center in a shirt with sky-blue stripes.) She shares her life with her partner, who makes a living in trade, and her four children, three of whom are in school and the youngest who is in her care. They live in their own brick house with potable water and electricity. \r\n\r\nThanks to her drive for self-improvement, she brought together people with similar needs and business such as: selling cell phone cases, selling coca leaves, selling quinoa juice, selling perfumes, selling soft drinks, selling traditional skirts, and selling ice cream, to request a loan and expand their businesses. Her business is baking, and the varieties of baked goods she makes are: rice bread, corn bread, cheese bread, and \u201csonso\u201d (a baked good made of yucca and cheese). These are all part of the typical baked goods of the eastern gastronomy. Accompanied by coffee or tea, they help to fight low temperatures or to enjoy the hot Santa Cruz afternoons. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a spacious, stocked bakery. She wants to buy various flours (wheat, corn, rice, etc.) at wholesale, to get ready for the end-of-year festivals, when sales increase. This is the first sequence of loans that she requests from the institution in her six months as an independent bakery (before, she worked as an assistant in a large bakery).\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Melfy is requesting a loan to buy flour at wholesale, to please her customers with her exquisite baked goods.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1725701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour at wholesale, to please her customers with her exquisite baked goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-16T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-16T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guido","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melfy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2029.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2113.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2143.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2173.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2252.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2267.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2300.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2366.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2399.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2434.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":311.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":317.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":602.24,"local_amount":4142.78,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4161.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556647},{"amount":627.6,"local_amount":4317.25,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4336.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157337},{"amount":974.93,"local_amount":6706.52,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6736.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554235},{"amount":673.54,"local_amount":4633.29,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4653.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226776},{"amount":1046.69,"local_amount":7200.16,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7232.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213953}],"funded_date":"2014-11-21T14:04:16Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cristina Bleicher","image":1721919}},{"id":792713,"name":"Maria Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 38 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer feliz, ya que cuenta con una familia constituida por su esposo, sus 2 ni\u00f1as de 12 y 6 a\u00f1os de edad y un var\u00f3n de 14 a\u00f1os de edad con los que habita en vivienda propia desde hace 10 a\u00f1os.

Gousia manages the in-house activities as well as the grocery business. From these businesses, she earns a monthly income of 5,500 Indian rupees. According to Gousia, in the context of the present market situation, this income is hand-to-mouth for her family, so it is very difficult to think for the future. Although there is potential market for her business, finances are a hindrance to her. \r\n\r\nAfter the intervention of Mahashakti Foundation in her village, Gousia saw a ray of hope and motivated other women members to lend from Mahashakti Foundation by forming this group. It will be their first loan cycle. With the present loan, she has planned to purchase more grocery items, such as rice, wheat, oil, tea, sugar, potatoes, onions, washing powder, soaps, etc., to expand the existing business. She hopes this will help her to generate more income to materialize her dream of giving better education to her children and constructing a house for her family. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the

Meet Frida, one of the most hardworking and dedicated women on planet earth. She is based in Iriga, a remote village in the Chuka area of Kenya. She is happily married to Kevin, who adds additional income to support their family. They are blessed with two lovely children. For the past 20 years she has been engaging in mixed farming, and through selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. \r\n\r\nAlthough Frida makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Frida comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity.\" Frida faces challenges carrying water on her back because of her failing health, and she is quickly aging. Frida is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture but Frida wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan she intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan, Frida will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boost productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops.\r\n\r\nFrida is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. She will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children.

She has a grandchild who is still in school. She has been running several projects, like mamalishe (food vending\/cafe), selling charcoal, and selling beers and local brew, for twenty years now. She works from 8:00 am to 11:00 pm daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be one of Rose's many loans she has taken from Tujijenge Tanzania. She used the previous loans to increase the food stock, and started selling charcoal, beers, local brew and soft drinks. She has paid back all her loans successfully. She is happy with the loans and appreciates Kiva for supporting her group.

Meet Emmy, a mother of four, from Kapsowar, a remote village town in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past 10 years of her life farming. She sells milk and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nEmmy is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has a high nutrient value. She is so keen and close with her cows, she has named one of them Teta. Milking Teta makes Emmy very proud, and she feels fulfilled.\r\n\r\nDairy farming is a very profitable business venture, and Emmy wants to take full advantage of it. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to grow her business. She is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow.\r\n\r\nEmmy has planted Napier grass, and feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used when she acquires the additional dairy cow. The exotic cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, and this will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk sales will allow Emmy to grow her business further. She will start to package milk and to process it into dairy products such as cream, yoghurt, and cheese.

This investment will help her increase her sales and make better profits for her family.  The market offers good opportunities because the area is truly agrarian and farmed produce is sold during all seasons of the year.
