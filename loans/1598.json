","en":"Rysbubu is 59 years old, widowed, and the mother of 3 children.  Rysbubu is on pension, but her work in livestock serves as the primary source of income for her and her family.  Thanks to Rysbubu's hard work, she now has 5 cows and 10 sheep.  Her monthly income is about 10,000 KGS.  These funds fail catastrophically to meet the needs of Rysbubu - she also helps her children and grandchildren who in turn actively help with the business.  The family is trying to put all of their savings toward the expansion and growth of the business.  Rysbubu turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase a cow to increase the size of her herd.  She plans to reinvest income from the loan back into her business in order to increase her family's

Filipinos prefer to buy these branded personal goods for their good quality. Emily is thanking God and you in advance for a good return of her investment and for the financial help that will be given to her as it will greatly cover her family's daily needs.   \r\n\r\nEmily aims to grow her business and hopes to own a franchise someday.

Meet Naomi from Eldoret Kenya, a woman from a community not known for farming, but one who is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married and together with her husband is blessed with four lovely children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, Naomi has been practicing mixed farming and, due to the experience she has, commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers who regard her as a mentor. Selling milk, eggs and vegetable has allowed her to earn a decent income. To make extra money, Naomi also engages in a small personal business. \r\n \r\nNaomi passionately loves dairy farming, and one of the animals on her farm has been given the name of \u201cChesker.\u201d Milking and feeding Chesker makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers. \r\n\r\nBecause demand has been overwhelming, Naomi is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow, a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce 10-20 litres of rich, creamy milk daily. The increased milk production will result in more income, and Naomi will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going children. \r\n\r\nWhen people listen to Naomi speak, they can be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming because of her passion and determination. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Naomi, and there is no doubt that rewarding employment can be found in dairy farming."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1733586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

agricultural institute, but she is an accomplished farmer from the Chuka area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. She is happily married and, together with her handsome husband, is blessed with two adorable children. \r\n\r\nFor the past ten years she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. Ann is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Chuka area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Ann could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Ann, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Ann believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. \r\n\r\nShe also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Ann to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1733625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-17T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-17T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":85000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6015.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6191.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6372.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6558.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6750.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6947.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7150.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7359.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7574.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7796.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8023.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8258.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":797773,"name":"Vergelio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vergelio has wide experience in farming.

Meet Rosemary, a youthful, 50-year-old shosho (old mum). She is a wise farmer, whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in Nkubu, in the central region of Kenya. Rosemary is happily married and, together with her husband, blessed with five lovely children. For the past 14 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, bananas, and vegetables and also, she keeps dairy cows. She has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.<br \/><br \/>Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Rosemary mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Rosemary is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge that has caused her to suffer so many losses. Perishable products, such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes, require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. Through this loan, Rosemary is going to achieve her dream and goal.<br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution is an uphill battle for women in Kenya. Rosemary feels relieved now, to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo (with help from Kiva) that help out women, so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Rosemary will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market. In addition, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, increasing her income level. Rosemary is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping her in farm work. With your loan, Rosemary will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":439.21,"image":{"id":1733575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to transport produce to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-17T01:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-12-17T01:30:09Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4954.1},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5098.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5247.9},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5401.27},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5559.12},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5721.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5888.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6060.9},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":6238.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6420.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6607.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6801.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.62},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.39},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.27},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":428.19,"local_amount":38430.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":39550.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.02,"payment_id":681377675}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T00:26:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":797842,"name":"Mwanajuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanajuma is a married woman with four children, all of whom attend school.

She has a university education and works as a vice principal and Kyrgyz language teacher at a school in addition to growing crops and raising livestock for several years, and earns roughly 15,000 som each month.  Thanks to her persistence and patience, her farm is doing quite well; she owns 0.57 hectares of land and rents an additional 1.20 hectares to grow cotton, corn, wheat and clover as cash crops, and also has three cows.

His only son is a student in his third year at Tajik National University, and is getting along well in his studies.  His son wants to be an educated civil servant just like his father; however, Qurbon and his wife have yet to pay for their son's third year of study.  They don't have the money to do so at the moment, and see this loan as their only solution.

Nkubu area of Kenya. Pauline, the mother of two, has overcome this challenge, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary source of income has been selling eggs, vegetables, and milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. \r\n\r\nPauline, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Through her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nPauline also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nPauline is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Pauline believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her child a solid educational background. This loan will be Pauline\u2019s way out of

Meet Silvia who is 33 years old from Chuka, a remote rural town in the central area of Kenya. This is a region with good weather patterns that favor crop and animal farming. She resides with her husband and they are blessed with two beautiful children. \r\n\r\nSilvia has been actively involved in mixed farming for the past 10 years and she sells milk, eggs, and various varieties of food crops at a local market and to her neighbors. She passionately loves poultry farming. The biggest challenge she is currently facing is the lack of quality breeds of poultry that are disease-resistant and grow well. To solve this problem she is kindly seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry that grow well. Having additional poultry will provide her with practical benefits, since she will be able to increase her egg productivity and also sell good quality poultry meat. Through the loan she will increase her profit margins and this will translate to better living conditions for her family. Silvia believes that through proper feeding of her poultry with high quality feed, they will grow even better. Other than profits from poultry she will benefit from chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen compared to other livestock manure. \r\n\r\nSilvia is comfortable with the repayment period and monthly instalments, and promises to make payments all throughout the repayment cycle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":407.16,"image":{"id":1733693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is currently single with one child who is six years old who is attending school. Six years ago, he had a girlfriend who is also blind. They had a daughter together. Shortly after their daughter was born, his girlfriend left him and their daughter. \r\n\r\nIn order to support his family and to raise his daughter, he began learning the skills of blind massaging, and opened a massage shop three years ago. Unfortunately, in August 2014, his apprentice in his massage shop drowned in the river in a freak accident. He compensated the family of the apprentice \u00a580,000. A part of this money came from his savings while he borrowed the rest from his relatives and friends.\r\n\r\nAs his relatives and friends require money urgently now, Yi Jin has to pay back his debts.

In the fall, although the leaves start to dry out, the inhabitants know that many holidays also begin, the next is November 2 when they remember the dead. The graves fill with flowers and votive candles then. \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of one family and is in its second loan cycle with VisionFund. They are very happy and thankful because their loan will help them to invest more in their businesses. Elodio and Valentina will invest in a grocery store, Paulina, Natalia and Eleuterina will invest in raising yearling sheep.\r\n\r\nValentina is very young but she is very friendly. She immediately was thrilled when she found out that people could help her. \"I was very interested in KIVA's goal. I like that people in other countries can get to know us and want to help us without meeting us.\"  She is 22 years old and has been married to David for a year. Together, they form a family with a young child who doesn't go to school yet.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, she opened a small grocery store just because she had plans of having a family and to help with the household expenses. Now that she has her baby and wants to spend most of the time with him, she also has the opportunity to continue taking care of this business which is in her house. With the loan, she will purchase groceries such as milk, bread, eggs, canned products, cold meat, detergents, etc. to improve the variety of merchandise. Valentina loves her little store since it is also very close to a primary school and every day, after school, the children run to buy candies. However, Valentina is very aware that there are many stores in the nearby streets, but she continues with enthusiasm to boost her store and soon will start to sell vegetables in the same place. What Valentina would like most is to have her own house because at the moment she lives with relatives.\r\n\r\n*In the picture: the group members are in the municipal plaza.

Recently Getha heard about HOPE Congo, and joined the community bank group SALEM (1). \r\n\r\nAs the leader of a subgroup of nine other micro-entrepreneurs who live and work in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo, Getha would like to take out a small loan of 150,000 CFA. \r\n\r\nWith this additional money, Getha will be able to purchase additional merchandise for her market stall, such sandals and bundles of used clothing. Business-savvy, Getha branched out from just used clothing to some food items as well to help her maintain an income in the slow times. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to become a high school teacher and use her degree. She plans to keep running a small business on the side, and hiring someone to work for her while she teaches. For her three-year-old son, Getha dreams of being able to send him to study in other countries so that he may one day come back to Brazzaville and work as a magistrate.

At her market stall, she sells items such as home-made peanut butter, vegetable oil, onions, and soap. \r\n\r\nArmande recently heard about HOPE Congo and decided to join the community bank ground RHEMA (1). Leading a small subgroup of 12 other micro-entrepreneurs, Armande would like to take out her first loan with HOPE Congo. Armande hopes to take out a loan of 250,000 CFA to invest in her stall. With this money Armande will be able to purchase more diverse items and supplement her old stock with goods such as spaghetti, soap, and salt. \r\n\r\nIn order to be more competitive in the market, Armande lowers her prices in relation to that of other people. She also draws in clients by giving out gifts to loyal customers. Armande plans to open a proper grocery store in the future that also sells drinks to customers walking by on the street. She dreams of her children finishing school and one day being able to buy a car or travel to another country.

his own barber shop. For over 10 years, Brejnev has been running his neighborhood barber shop, gradually gaining a reputation of being an extremely qualified and professional barber. People now come from different neighborhoods purely for his services. One of the biggest difficulties with running a barbershop in Brazzaville, the Republic of  Congo, is the lack of stable power. Brejnev has planned ahead however, and hopes to be able to purchase a generator in the next year to have a consistent source of electricity. Brejnev hopes to be able to do this as part of HOPE Congo with the community bank group RHEMA (2). \r\n\r\nAs a member of RHEMA (2) and the leader of a subgroup of 11 other micro-entrepreneurs, Brejnev wants to take out a small loan of 250,000 CFA. With this loan, Brejnev will be able to restock hair products such as powder and electric hair clippers. \r\n\r\nBrejnev is a savvy businessman, and says his strategy to draw in clients is to always be welcoming, and to do sales during holidays like Christmas. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Brejnev dreams of being able to have his own modern barbershop with electricity, air conditioning, and a wide arrange of hair styling tools. He also hopes to diversify his business activities to launch into the taxi business. For himself and his family, he hopes to be able to build his own home and that his young children will finish school well.

Beautiful scenery and the hospitality of its inhabitants is what most distinguishes this region.  The members of the \u201cEl Molino Del Rosal\u201d group have many things in common.  Primarily, they all sell the traditional fair bread.  \r\n\r\nSmiling all the time, Mar\u00eda Luisa starts to go over time in her memory.  With more than 40 years of experience, and being by the bread ovens, she says that it all started because her husband worked in this business activity since before they were married.  She realized that Emiliano needed support, and that it would be easier to get ahead with two of them.  \u201cNo one is born knowing,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Luisa.  \u201cIn the beginning it was difficult.\u201d  However, her husband was patient in teaching her the art of baking bread.\r\n\r\nNow it is a family business activity.  Sons, daughter, and daughter-in-law work at following the most important fairs in Mexico during the entire year.  \u201cMy favorite is the one in Guanajuato in November.\u201d  The people from everywhere with their different languages, traditions, and colors are what Mar\u00eda Luisa loves.  They are what make this city known worldwide as a favorite point of sales.\r\n\r\nSo it is that on the festival nights Mexicans and foreigners are able to enjoy the nut bread or the vanilla bread for only 35 pesos.  Mar\u00eda Luisa wants to prepare for next month.  She will use the loan to buy more milk, eggs, flour, nuts, and artificial flavorings.\r\n\r\nLuisa has a big family, 10 children and 15 grandchildren.  \u201cI am proud of them,\u201d she says, moved upon finding the correct words.  Only one of her daughters continues in school, and she hopes to be able to continue supporting her so that she completes her studies in what she likes the most, nursing.\r\n\r\nOn special dates, after traveling to various states selling bread, Luisa finally has the opportunity to get together with her children and grandchildren to enjoy a good meal, to spoil the littlest ones, and to continue preserving memories.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Femina, Jaqueline, Crisitina, and Francisca.

With this money Regine will have enough fish in stock for the holiday season when there is the greatest demand.  Known around her neighborhood for the quality of her prepared fish, Regine strategically places herself just outside the market to sell to people doing their shopping.

Meet Pamella--a wife, a mother, and a farmer with 10 years\u2019 experience in mixed farming. She lives in Chuka, Kenya, together with her three children on a small piece of land that she inherited from her parents. Pamella completed high school thanks to the financial support and effort of her parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit she has for succeeding in life. Through mixed farming, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of crops to the local market and neighbors. She passionately loves poultry farming, and as she likes to say, \u201cPoultry is close to my heart.\u201d \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble and ever-smiling mother has been making profits selling poultry, she faces challenges of lack of funds to buy good quality breeds of poultry and to expand her poultry farming. She is requesting a loan to buy poultry. She has identified good breeds of poultry that will increase productivity and produce quality meat. Pamella has enough poultry feed, i.e., maize, to give the poultry energy and enough green grams to give the poultry protein. This will assure increased productivity. \r\n\r\nShe chose to join Juhudi Kilimo to have access to quality loans at an affordable interest rate. With the loan, she will improve her living conditions and benefit from the profits. She will also get chicken manure, which will save her a lot of cash that would have been spent on fertilizer. This loan will be a turning point in Pamella\u2019s life as she will improve her living standards and secure the future of her school-going

The crops she grows are mainly for household consumption while the surplus production is sold in the market which is also her main source of income. By doing this, she generates income that is spent in buying household requirements and payment of other fees. \r\n\r\nDuring the off-season, she also weaves traditional garments for income generation. She plays an important role in meeting her family's needs. She wanted to access a loan so that she can buy more saplings and fertilizers for farming.

Juana is of dark complexion, medium height, robust physically, has long black hair; her native language is Spanish and she knows Quechua from her parents who are from the west (Seated in the black shirt). She goes about her life with her husband who works in transportation, and her children. The oldest studies in school, and the youngest is in her care. \r\n\r\nShe made a communal bank of eight members who work in various fields because of the need to expand her business and meet the needs of her children. The other members work in selling aprons, shirts, children's clothes, empanadas, cell phones, smoothies, and shirt-making. This is to request a loan and have their businesses prosper. \r\n\r\nJuana's business is selling cosmetics from catalogs.

John describes his upbringing as challenging, so he is doing everything in his power to provide a good foundation for his children and to help secure their future. \r\n\r\nJohn has been farming for over ten years. Over the years, he has gained much experience and is now considered to be one of the best farmers in his village because of the immense knowledge he possesses. Since he has excess food for dairy cattle and enough space on his land, John has always wanted to buy another dairy cow, but his challenge is a lack of finances. \r\n\r\nThat is why Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men, like John, to turn their dreams into reality. John believes the loan will help him to satisfy the demand for milk in his area and enable him to realize his dream of developing his business into a large enterprise. \r\n\r\nMany men in Kenya are responsible for not only producing food, but also feeding their family. John wants to provide all of the basic needs that his children and parents require.

At this time, Catalina wants to invest in merchandise again (rice, soup, beans, eggs, milk, sugar, coffee, cheese, crackers, cooking oil and detergent) so she can offer her customers a wider variety of products.  Catalina takes care of her parents.  She says, \"They took care of me when I couldn't care for myself, and now I will take care of them.\"  That was her motivation in starting her business.  It is also an activity that allows her to look out for her parents.  Catalina was also encouraged by her siblings to open the store.

Menevar has a secondary education. Since her retirement in 2000, she has been involved in agriculture, providing an income for her family. Thanks to Menevar's hard work, today her business has 2 bulls and 25 sheep. Her children actively help with the business in their free time. The monthly profit from the business amounts to just over 11,000 som (KGS). The earnings are catastrophically not enough for a decent life and satisfying all of the family's needs, and this is why Menevar requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy dairy cows in order to sell milk because Menevar already has potential customers. The earnings from the loan will allow Menevar to develop her business and improve her family's

His father, the family patriarch, did everything to keep his entire family together. At first, Angel\u2019s family cultivated and traded corn. Recently, Angel took over the fieldwork from his aging father (pictured with him, in a straw hat). He began planting avocado and asparagus for their own consumption. Then he learned about the organic production of avocado from Fairtrasa. He found the idea very good because he could have the possibility to get higher yields, preserve the quality of their farmland and take care of his family because they would no longer get exposed to toxic pesticides.

Like many other households in the village, her family's source of income mainly comes from farming, in which cultivating rice is the most important production. However, the income from rice farming is not enough to cover her family's living expenses. This has motivated La and her husband to increase production in animal husbandry by raising pigs, fish, chickens and ducks. \r\n\r\nThis is the second time that La has taken out a loan from the Anh Chi Em Program and she will use the loan to buy small fish to expand animal husbandry and earn more income.

With her earnings, she helps her husband with the household expenses.  Five months ago, her love of animals lead Lea to raising laying hens.  She started selling the free-range eggs, which has earned her a good profit.  She currently has forty hens and only one rooster, so she needs a loan to purchase three more roosters and continue raising her hens.  She also wants to purchase more feed and mesh to fix up the corral where she keeps the animals.  Lea says, \"It's nice to hear the hens clucking, and instead of an alarm, it's the rooster that wakes us up.\"  Lea hasn't given up her perfume sales.  In the afternoons, she goes out to show her catalogs and drum up orders, deliver merchandise and collect payments.  Lea proudly tells us that her husband helps her with caring for the hens, and her little ones go out and collect the eggs that the hens have laid. \r\n\r\nIn the above photo, Lea is standing in the first row, is first from the right and is wearing a flowered a top.

Marapat has a secondary education. It is difficult to find work in the village, but necessary to support the family and raise the children by herself. Marapat's youngest son is 15 years old. This is why she has been involved in agriculture for 4 years. Today her business has 2 cows, 1 calf and 1.95 hectares of land, where Marapat grows wheat and clover. Her monthly income amounts to only 15,000 som (KGS), but this money is not enough for a decent life for Marapat and her children. And because agriculture is Marapat's source of income, she requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a cow with a calf in order to increase her livestock headcount. Marapat plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her livestock quantities, which will allow her to increase her family's income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":612.5,"image":{"id":1733530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a cow with a calf in order to increase her livestock headcount and business income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Noogardan village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-11-17T18:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-01T18:50:11Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marapat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500241}],"funded_date":"2014-11-18T21:44:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":798063,"name":"Cristobal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristobal has always loved service.

He is single and has no children. He runs a business fishing from his boat with nets. He is independent, enterprising, patient, optimistic, responsible and hard-working. He works in the community of \u2018Isla Suriqui\u2019, a piece of land located on the smaller lake of Lake Titicaca. This land is winding, rugged and rocky. The climate is cold, and the average height is 3800 metres above sea level. The local inhabitants normally wear dark and black clothing because it traps sunlight, giving a sensation of warmth.\n\nJuan has a dark complexion and black hair, and is of medium height. His native language is Aymara and he speaks Spanish for trade. He works fishing from his boat with nets, from Monday to Sunday. The waters of the lake are cold, almost freezing, which is why no-one swims in them, except for professional and experienced swimmers. \n\nHe and the boat he uses have worked in the business for ten years, which is why it is damaged and is not sufficiently safe to fish. Necessity requires him to keep the boat afloat until he can buy a new one and get rid of it. In his business, fishing nets are one of the most widely-used tools and constantly wear out, which is why he has to replace them all the time.\n\nThis is his second series of loans with the organisation. He wants to use the money to buy a dinghy and fishing nets. His dream is to improve his income in order to start a family.

She runs a mixed farm on a 2-acre piece of land that belongs to the husband she married 10 years ago when she became a farmer. From this activity, she generates a decent income that she uses to take care of her 4 children's needs. \r\n \r\nNancy's farm has 2 cows, 3 chickens, tea, bananas and trees. She is seeking a small loan of 20,000 KES that she will use to purchase more poultry, construct poultry housing and buy farm items.

","en":"Mahabat is 43 years old, a widow, and the mother of three children. As a main source of income for her family, Mahabat has worked with livestock breeding for a period of 10 years. Thanks to her persistent work, Mahabat currently has two cows and 21 sheep on her farm. \r\n\r\nMahabat's business brings her a monthly income of around 10,000 som (KGS). Even if this money is however not enough for living costs, Mahabat is not discouraged but goes through life with optimism. Therefore, with an aim to develop her business, she turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows. This will allow her to increase the number of livestock and the family's future

","en":"Gulumkan is 45 years old, married and the mother of four children. The youngest daughter is of school age and lives with her parents. Gulumkan has secondary education. Since 2005 she has worked with agriculture. Currently her farm has two cows, three horses, three bull-calves, two calves and 20 sheep. She also has a plot of land of 0.5 hectares, where she and her husband grow sweet corn. \r\n\r\nThe family is happy to take on any kind of work, and the children help actively with the farm.

Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for her family's needs, especially for her children. She and her partner had to work hard, determined to have a better income, to provide their children with a better education.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also operates her food business that also helps her improve her daily income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo improve sales, Maria Isadora would like to apply for a loan to purchase additional grocery goods to sell. At an amount of 11,000 PHP (Philippine Pesos), she could already purchase larger quantities and more varieties of grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Maria Isadora dreams to have additional sources of income like rice distribution or reselling frozen goods for she wants to give her children good and quality education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT (Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This ambitious bachelor has one goal in life, which is to succeed. \r\n\r\nWilliam started farming 2 year ago, and his primary income source has been milk and banana farming. He is thankful to God that his business has been profitable so far. \r\n\r\nWilliam is seeking a loan to jump-start horticulture farming. Land in Nkubu is very fertile, so the major challenge facing farmers like William is usually weed management. In a country characterized by food insecurity, William sees a big opportunity to start a business growing vegetables and other food crops. \r\n\r\nHe is currently unable to put up the money to get the horticulture farm going because of the high cost farm-inputs such as equipment, seed, and fertilizer. For that reason, he is counting on your consideration to make his dream come true. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, William will realize his dream and contribute in a small way towards the fight for food security in Kenya.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":160.84,"image":{"id":1734399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start a horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-17T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-01T21:00:06Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.17,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1061.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14.6,"local_amount":1251.59,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1314.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194713},{"amount":25.95,"local_amount":2224.23,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2335.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824112},{"amount":27.83,"local_amount":2385.15,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264579},{"amount":13.86,"local_amount":1188.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1247.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459258},{"amount":14.67,"local_amount":1290.87,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1355.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"payment_id":681377685},{"amount":14.37,"local_amount":1272.93,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1336.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"payment_id":696587363},{"amount":14.6,"local_amount":1332.08,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1398.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.94,"payment_id":711505675},{"amount":31.79,"local_amount":2841.04,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2983.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.36,"payment_id":731022479}],"funded_date":"2014-11-17T22:58:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":798161,"name":"Concepcion Gonzala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Concepcion is a 54-year old widow who lives with her family.
