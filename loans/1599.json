He is happily married, and together with his beautiful wife, are blessed with two children. \r\n\r\nFor the past six years he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. He sells milk and farm produce to his neighbors and to the local market but has been facing one big problem and that is timely delivery of the products to the market. He is seeking a loan to buy another motorbike that would solve his transportation problem. \r\n\r\nKerugoya is located in a very remote area that has a poor road network and the terrain is very bad. The only mode of transport is Boda Boda (motorbike).This loan will be of great help because it will allow Ngini to transport his farm products to the market and deliver them in a timely manner. Milk and vegetables are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch high prices. Through the loan, Ngini will not be worried because he will always deliver the products on time and gain more profits. This motorbike will be reliable for quick transportation for both long and short distances. Through the motorbike, Ngini's life is going to change and his standards of living are going to improve."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1734440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another motorbike.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-17T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-01T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ngini","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.62,"local_amount":8488.49,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8785.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262526},{"amount":87.58,"local_amount":7615.81,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7882.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600831},{"amount":150.51,"local_amount":13432.35,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13902.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.96,"payment_id":681377687},{"amount":225.7,"local_amount":20463.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":21179.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.63,"payment_id":731022481}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T16:38:44Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Grantham","image":456803}},{"id":798347,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is 43 years old and married with three children.

Es madre soltera de tres hijos, por lo que hace tiempo inici\u00f3 con la venta de antojitos pues necesitaba solventar los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus peque\u00f1os. Al principio vend\u00eda en su casa debajo de un gran \u00e1rbol de mango donde pon\u00eda una lona y acomodaba dos mesas. Pronto, las vecinas tambi\u00e9n comenzaron a vender comida y fue como decidi\u00f3 salir a vender de manera ambulante en una carretilla a pesar de que era un poco inc\u00f3modo, mas sus hijos le daban fuerzas en todo momento para salir adelante aquellas veces que pensaba que el negocio no funcionaria. Hoy en d\u00eda vende en la escuela primaria y lo hace en un triciclo el cual acondicion\u00f3 para poder transportar los antojitos. Su labor inicia a las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana preparando la comida, para la cual utiliza le\u00f1a pues le da un mejor sabor a lo que prepara.

","en":"On the outskirts of the small town where Las Orqu\u00eddeas [The Orchids] live there is an inactive tar pit and the ruins of a quarry.\r\nSowing sugar cane, agricultural work and the small businesses are what give life to the village. The group members who work day after day in their businesses for their families are:\r\n\r\nGloria - Undergarment Sales\r\nAlma - Cosmetics Sales\r\nCynthia - Cyber Service\r\nEusebia - Finger Food Sales\r\nMartin \u2013 Stationary Sales\r\nYazmin - Fertilizer Sales\r\nMar\u00eda - Finger Food Sales\r\n\r\nEusebia is a strong but kind woman. She is a single mother of three children and therefore started her finger food sales awhile ago as she needed to meet household expenses and pay for her children's education. Starting off she sold from her house by putting a tarpaulin and two tables under a large mango tree. Soon her neighbors also began selling food and therefore she decided to continue her sales on the streets with a pushcart even though this was less comfortable for her. Her children gave her strength to continue ahead whenever she felt that the business would not work out.\r\n\r\nNowadays she sells at the elementary school using a tricycle that she fixed up to transport the food. She starts her working day at 7am by preparing the food for which she uses wood as it provides the food with a better taste. Afterwards she accommodates everything on her tricycle together with sweets that she has also begun selling. She then commends herself to God and makes her way to the school so that she gets there 10 minutes ahead of the break. Also, during sugar cane harvesting season she has new clients that she provides with their daily lunch.\r\n\r\nEusebia needs the loan to buy meat, cream, corn, cheese, new tires for her tricycle and a large umbrella to protect herself from the sun and the rain. This will enable her to continue with her business which provides for her daughter that still lives with her and studies at school. \"I have decided that I will now also sell finger food from my home on the weekends\" she comments decidedly.\r\n\r\n*Eusebia is wearing a tank top in the photo.

They are requesting a loan to purchase pillows. \u201cIt is a product that sells very well in the cold season because the pillows are warm.\u201d For this reason, Emma is very interested in receiving her loan as they want to leave in a few days to go and sell their products in other states. They always go away for periods of approximately 20 days. Emma also sells other products like threads, cords, and spare parts for blenders. She explains that her passion for sales comes from her mother-in-law as she also had a business and accompanied her on many occasions and taught her many things. At the beginning it wasn\u2019t easy, but over time and after years of experience Emma managed to establish herself with her clients. She began requesting loans from VisionFund five years ago.

Moses lives with his beautiful wife in Kapsowar, a small rural town in Kenya. The Kapsowar area is also referred to as the mango region of Kenya because half the mangoes consumed are from that region. He has been farming for the past five years and has never looked back. To earn a decent and honest living, he sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. Moses is satisfied with the returns he gets through farming. However, he wants to diversify and start horticulture farming. The main challenge he faces is accessing funds. He is kindly requesting a loan to start horticulture farming.

Meet Polycap, who is 23 years of age, a hard worker, and a very honest farmer. He hails from the Kisii area of Kenya, an area that has good rainfall patterns and is known for banana farming. Polycap has one child whom he adores and cherishes, and a beautiful wife who always paints a smile on his face. He has been practicing mixed farming for the past six years and is making great strides. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living through milk and egg selling and personal business. These ventures have enabled him to send his child to school and feed his family. \r\n\r\nPolycap has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow, thereby enhancing his milk-selling profits. Because of increased demand, Polycap is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Polycap is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Through increased profits, Polycap is sure that he will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family.

Meet Edwin. He is a 39-year-old farmer from Kipsaiya village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and three children on a small piece of land where he keeps dairy cows, poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. \r\n\r\nFor ten years, his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. \r\n\r\nEdwin made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime last month, he applied for a loan for expanding his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. \r\n\r\nThe additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas.

28, is a resident of Coron, Palawan, Philippines. She is married to Nassir, a tricycle driver and has one child who is still in the Preparatory Level in school. She and her husband work hard to meet their everyday needs and to send her child to school. \n\nSyra operates a tricycle which her husband drives that carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in provinces like Palawan, a tricycle is a common mode of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle. The townspeople usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, their friend\u2019s homes, and to other destinations within their community. They even transport from one town to the other. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 a day. She now has a backyard piggery business.\n\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 32,000 loan which she will use for repairs and maintenance of her tricycle and also to buy feeds for her pig. She is positive that this will boost her income as tricycle transportation is badly needed in their area, and a piggery business is a profitable business since a pig can give birth to three to four piglets and they can easily be sold as roasted piglet.\n\nSyra dreams of one day being more successful in business so she can give her child the best education possible and to ensure a bright future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. It is there where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God that she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1733497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

business. She was able to purchase peppers, misua (salted Chinese noodles), crackers, potassium aluminum sulfate, and other products which are needed to increase her product inventory. The loan also helped her provide for the educational expenses of her children and pay for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nRuth is very positive that she could further improve her business, if you will let her borrow again, in the amount of PHP 20,000. This new loan will go to additional stocks of peppers, misua, crackers, potassium aluminum sulfate, and other products to sell. \r\n\r\nHer customers will likely buy more items, if she has more of her products displayed in her store. An increase in sales should also result in a significant increase in profit, which will also result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she could sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nIn addition to growing her business, Ruth aims to send all her children to school. Every week, she meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

is a 19-year old college undergraduate and lives in Valladolid. She belongs to a family of 8. Her father is an OFW in Saudi Arabia and works as a site supervisor in a construction company. Her mother is a housewife. Joyce has 5 siblings. Her elder sister is in college and the rest are in high school or elementary. Their total monthly family income of Php 35,000.00 ($795) is barely enough to provide for everyone's many needs.

She has been raising her kids alone since her husband passed away four years ago. Her three boys are still at school and they are 11, 13 and 14 years old. \nSahar has been working as a school teacher for ten years but with her husband's death, she started giving private tutoring classes at home to six students in order to increase her income and support the household's expenses. \nShe also owns a small apartment inside the camp that she intends to rent for extra revenue. \nSahar is asking for a 1,543,658 Lebanese pounds loan for the first time from Kiva partner Ibdaa in order to improve the apartment and make it suitable for renting. \nThe loan will therefore allow her to increase her monthly income and fulfill her commitment to see her children complete their high school education.

But Tyler is confident there are some keepsakes that need to be made -- simple keepsakes that Americans would love. \r\n\r\nThis $4,000 loan will go toward the manufacturing of 12 keepsakes for ashes. Cremation is growing rapidly in the US and is preparing to overtake traditional burial. Many Americans are choosing not only to opt for cremation, but also to keep the cremated remains of their loved one close in keepsakes. This increase in popularity of keepsakes and addition to funeral homes' revenue in cremation is why Tyler is confident this is a smart investment.\r\n\r\nThe landscape in the funeral profession is changing quickly. More baby boomers are dying. And that means interests are changing and purchasing behaviors are changing. UPD Urns seeks to offer what baby boomers want by focusing on the cremation jewelry segment and offering new and improved designs that families want.\r\n\r\nUPD is confident this investment in

She is 21 years old and a single mother. She has two children who are her motivation to fight and work hard every day. She lives and works in the Pedro Vicente Maldonado canton, which has a high development index. The weather is warm and humid, which results in very productive lands.\r\n\r\nShe has faced numerous obstacles in life. For instance, she could not study because her parents did not have enough money. She started working when she was young, selling fast food as a street vendor. She learned this from her parents, by helping them to sell food in the streets when she was a girl. She now works eight hours every day, on average. She takes care of her business on her own, so she has to find ways to keep an eye on her children while she works. She likes to spend her free time with them.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult thing for her is to take her food stall from where she lives to the place where she works, since it requires great physical effort. She has many dreams. One of them is to be able to buy a piece of land where she can build her own house.\r\n\r\nRuth will use this loan to buy a fryer to make \u201csalchipapas\u201d [a mix of sausages and potatoes] and to increase her working capital.

So far, she has been involved with this career for almost 20 years.<br \/><br \/>To keep her bananas and coffee growing well and provide larger yields, Mariam wants to use some natural fertilizers on her farmland.

Don Rom\u00e1n y Do\u00f1a Teresa son abuelos de 17 ni\u00f1os.\n\nCuando era joven don Rom\u00e1n no ten\u00eda un trabajo fijo y decidi\u00f3 iniciar con la venta de limones en la Cuidad de M\u00e9xico. En su momento fue un negocio muy bueno pero con el tiempo sus ganancias eran cada vez menos. La pasi\u00f3n que tenia por vender era muy grande as\u00ed que comenz\u00f3 a vender ropa deportiva, sombreros y artesan\u00edas.\n\nDon Rom\u00e1n y los dem\u00e1s integrantes necesitan el cr\u00e9dito para comprar mercanc\u00eda, pero sobretodo materia prima como hilos, estambres, aujas, etc. para bordar y tener artesan\u00edas listas para los meses de noviembre y diciembre cuando tienen sus mejores ventas. Toda la familia trabaja con mucho empe\u00f1o durante todo el mes de octubre y noviembre porque ya tienen clientes seguros a los que les entregan bufandas, gorros y guantes bordados. Para ellos es un extraordinario negocio porque la temporada de vientos fr\u00edos ya est\u00e1 iniciando y la gente compra mucho este tipo de prendas. \"Es un patrimonio de nuestros abuelitos, ellos fueron los que nos ense\u00f1aron a bordar\u201d coment\u00f3 don Rom\u00e1n. Adem\u00e1s de vender a los clientes seguros, la familia tambi\u00e9n sale a vender a la capital del pa\u00eds. \n\nLas dificultades a las que se ha enfrentado don Rom\u00e1n es que no tiene un espacio determinado para vender y en ocasiones la polic\u00eda no permite a vendedores ambulantes establecerse en cualquier lugar, por lo que sus sue\u00f1o es tener un local donde mostrar todas sus prendas bordadas. \n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Teresa quien invertir\u00e1 en bocinas y l\u00e1mparas; Esperanza, en artesan\u00edas y Erika, en bocinas.\n\n*La foto fue tomada afuera de la casa del se\u00f1or Rom\u00e1n y los integrantes muestran una bolsa con la ropa bordada que elaboran.","en":"The San Francisco group is made up of families who make a living selling crafts, sportswear, speakers, and hats.\r\n\r\nRom\u00e1n who is the representative of the group is a very hard working man who is 65 years old. He has been married to Teresa for 40 years and together they formed a family of nine children but currently none of them are dependents, as they have formed their own families. Rom\u00e1n and Teresa have 17 grandchildren.\r\n\r\nWhen he was young Rom\u00e1n did not have a steady job and he decided to start by selling lemons in Mexico City. At the time it was a very good business but eventually he was earning less. He has a great passion for sales so he began selling sportswear, hats, and crafts.\r\n\r\nRom\u00e1n and the other members need loans in order to buy merchandise, but above all supplies such as yarn, embroidery thread, and knitting needles to have handicrafts ready for the months of November and December when they have their best sales. The entire family works hard during all of October and November because they already have certain customers to deliver scarves, hats, and knitted gloves. It is an extraordinary business for them because the cold winds are already starting and people buy a lot of these types of garments. \u201cIt is an inheritance from our grandparents, as they were the ones that taught us to knit,\u201d Rom\u00e1n commented. Besides selling to regular customers the family also goes out to sell in the country\u2019s capital.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty that Rom\u00e1n has faced is that he does not have a fixed place to sell and sometimes the police to do not allow the traveling vendors to sell in one place or another, so his dream is to have his own facility where he can show all his knitted garments.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Teresa who will invest in speakers and lamps, Esperanza in handicrafts and Erika in speakers.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken outside Rom\u00e1n\u2019s house and the members are showing a bag with the knitted clothing they make.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6325,"image":{"id":1726477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy yarn, embroidery thread, and needles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Francisco del Rio, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T02:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T02:50:01Z","loan_amount":6325,"lender_count":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":89.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":86000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":6325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10544.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":11181.52},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":11610.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":12180.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12970.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13415.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14096.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":822.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":853.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":895.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":953.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":986.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1036.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775.54,"local_amount":10544.83,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T16:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10553.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579807800},{"amount":822.36,"local_amount":11181.54,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":11190.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349898},{"amount":853.99,"local_amount":11611.58,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11621.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980612},{"amount":865.85,"local_amount":12181.17,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12191.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.03,"payment_id":624423766},{"amount":935.78,"local_amount":12971.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":12982.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.22,"payment_id":636769108},{"amount":977.38,"local_amount":13415.74,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":13427.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.3,"payment_id":649763897},{"amount":1004.26,"local_amount":14093.79,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":14105.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":32.29,"payment_id":665597465}],"funded_date":"2014-11-18T19:17:02Z","paid_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":798468,"name":"Lovely Sisters Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicenta is the featured borrower of the Lovely Sisters group.

Meet Stephen. He is a progressive, smallholder, mixed-farmer in Kenya. He comes from the luxuriant, white highlands of Nkubu, an area known for maize production and dairy farming. Stephen owns a fertile, two-acre piece of land in this lush region of Kenya. On the land, he keeps dairy cattle and grows maize. He gets a lot of support from his dear wife, Salome. Being a father of four comes with lots of responsibility and feeding this large family requires a lot of hard work, so Stephen has to put in extra efforts to comfortably take care of his family. \r\n\r\nStephen started farming just after finishing high school; since he never advanced his education and because of the high unemployment rate he ventured into farming, and he has never regretted this because of the profits he has been making. Stephen practices mixed farming and is regarded as one of the hardworking farmers in his village because he is able to juggle between keeping dairy cows and also doing crop farming. Stephen is a visionary and enterprising person and has always wanted to do dairy farming in large scale but one of the challenges he has faced is lack of enough capital. That is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan Stephen is confident that his life will be transformed and his dream of providing a secure future for his children will be achieved. Stephen is relieved to know that his life can be secured through partners such as Kiva lenders who help small scale and aspiring men such as him."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":551.01,"image":{"id":1734694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.82,"local_amount":3636.17,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3769.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194720},{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":3464.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3591.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824124},{"amount":44.52,"local_amount":3871.64,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4013.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262531},{"amount":44.38,"local_amount":3859.41,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4001.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264586},{"amount":44.1,"local_amount":3835.16,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3976.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600838},{"amount":47.67,"local_amount":4145.33,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4297.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459265},{"amount":48.09,"local_amount":4284.89,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4442.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.19,"payment_id":681377694},{"amount":47.04,"local_amount":4219.1,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4374.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.48,"payment_id":696587369},{"amount":179.63,"local_amount":16598.1,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":17207.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.25,"payment_id":711505684}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T20:12:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":798465,"name":"Chaman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A lady by the name of Chaman will use this loan to develop her business so she can meet her clients' needs and generate more income for her family.

Introducing Sammy, a 28-year-old father who is full of energy and a very hard worker. He hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya, an area with good and favorable weather patterns that support farming. He is a father of one child who is under his care from his marriage. Sammy completed his secondary school education thanks to the financial support and effort of his parents, but never advanced. This never killed the spirit he had for succeeding in life. \r\n\r\nSammy has been farming for the past ten years, and through mixed farming, he has been able to take care of his family. He loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows 'Motune' (from a person's name). Although Sammy passionately loves farming, he faces the challenge of water shortages. Most of the rain water goes to waste, which is why he is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Sammy comes from an area where there is no piped water. Therefore this water tank will assist him in harvesting water during the rainy seasons and also to store water for home consumption. \r\n\r\nHarvested water will assist Sammy to irrigate his farm, ensuring that there is a constant production of crops. This loan will turn the life of Sammy around as he will no longer have to walk long distances in search of water, hence saving more time and generating more energy and time to his farm. This loan will help Sammy's wife Stacy too because she will no longer have to walk for hours in search of this precious commodity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1734717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a water tank and water pipes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T03:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T03:20:13Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sammy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.49,"local_amount":5346.94,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5543.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194721},{"amount":68.12,"local_amount":5923.56,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6141.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824126},{"amount":445.39,"local_amount":38729.5,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":40151.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264587}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T01:15:23Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Clover van Steenberghe","image":1359957}},{"id":798477,"name":"Nikodemus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nikodemus, 49 years old, is married to Yusina, 46 years old.

women entrepreneurs of  the village called Khaerpadar located in Nuapada district, one of the poorest districts of India. The main objective of forming the SHG was to take a loan from the Mahashakti Foundation and develop their small existing businesses for better livelihood of their families. \r\n\r\nSangita the cheerful lady standing with raised hand in the photo is one of them. She is 22 years old and her family consists of her husband and one small child. Sangita has been running a small bakery factory in her house with the help of her husband for last five years. She produces cakes or breads, muffins, donuts, and other baked goodies in her factory. She has engaged two skilled laborers for the processing and making of bakery items. \r\n\r\nHer husband supplies the products to nearby town and also vendors from ten villages come to her to take the products. Sangita says that, owing to better quality, design, packing and forms of her products, there is a lot of demand from the locality, but due to shortage of stock she was not able to meet their demands. \r\n\r\nShe does not like to say \u201cNo\u201d to her customers and wants to give better services to them. So she now wants to buy more stock raw materials at a time to save the transportation cost and price hike as well as to increase her production to meet the demands and grab her customers. From the present loan of 16,000 INR, Sangita has planned to purchase raw materials like oil, dough, sugar etc. in bulk to produce the bakery items for a longer period. \r\n\r\nAs the present location of the factory is congested and not so suitable, she also wants to construct a separate house in a prominent place of her locality to run the business smoothly. She hopes to save money from the sale proceeds to provide better education facilities to her child and purchase a van for supply of items in the locality.\r\n\r\nThe other ten members of the group, who are also doing business like mobile repairing shop, tiffin stall, rice haler, milk selling, etc., want to grow their business by taking this loan. All group members feel that from this investment they can be able to develop their living standards. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of oil, dough, sugar, etc., in bulk for more bakery production for better living standards","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KHAERPADAR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dipika           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gouri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyotsnarani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rekha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sangita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saranbani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sorojoini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Usarani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":168000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-11T02:15:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":798498,"name":"Ramzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramzana is a 36-year-old married woman.

She is residing with her husband, three daughters of 14, 8, and 6 years, and one son of 10 years of age, all of whom are continuing their studies in the local Higher Secondary and government primary schools. \r\n\r\nGadiajor is a remotely located village in a neglected area. Due to the border area of two districts, the reach and focus of the administration and public services is very much less for this village. The people of this area are also deprived of many government facilities and bank services for getting support for developing their standard of living.\r\n\r\nThe main source of income of Satyabhama is vegetable cultivation and vending and cotton cultivation. She produces different types of vegetables like brinjal (eggplant), cauliflower, cabbage, chile, ladies' fingers (okra), etc., in her farm. She also cultivates cotton, which is a cash crop for this area. From the above two businesses, Satyabhama earns a monthly income of 7000 INR. With this income Satyabhama maintains her six-member family and manages the educational expenses and farming expenses. \r\n\r\nShe sadly expressed that, this income is not at all sufficient to manage the above expenses and plan for future development. When Mahashakti started intervention in her village, Satyabhama saw a ray of hope and along with 13 other women of her village formed a Self-Help Group named Maa Baishnadebi and took a loan, with 16,000 INR as her share. \r\n\r\nFrom this loan, she will purchase farm inputs like seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides for her vegetable farm and cotton cultivation. She is very positive that this loan must help her for fulfilling her dream of constructing a house and educating her children to lead respectable lives.\r\n \r\nThe other thirteen members of this group are also involved in micro enterprises of their own like general grocery shops, cotton cultivation, milk business and fish vending business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of farm inputs like seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides for her vegetable farm and cotton cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"GADIAJOR, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhakiaa          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dahana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Durlabh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jajnaseni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jemati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lakshmi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manorama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ratane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukamani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saemani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satyabhama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shrimati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T16:27:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":798532,"name":"Elsha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsha does livestock farming and has been in the business for 3 years.

Meet Edwin, a 27-year-old father who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking man on this planet Earth. Edwin is a father of three lovely children that he really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. Edwin hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Edwin never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white collar job but this did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life. Edward started farming and has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, he has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Edwin practices mixed farming on his farm and through the profits, he has managed to take care of his family's needs and give his children a good education because he believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. \r\n\r\nEdwin is a man who is very enterprising. He is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Edwin wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like Edward to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Edwin hopes that through the loan, he will improve his living conditions. Edwin's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, he will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, he will be able to assure his children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because he will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Edwin is not a selfish man and will also want to impact positively on society. That is why he will employ people to work for him on his horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":202.19,"image":{"id":1734869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.27,"local_amount":3757.31,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3810.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824128},{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":3518.81,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3568.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264588},{"amount":19.87,"local_amount":1766.17,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459266},{"amount":41.87,"local_amount":3813.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3867.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":681377695},{"amount":55.3,"local_amount":5116.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5188.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.26,"payment_id":731022488}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T08:19:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":798551,"name":"Katrine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katrine is 61 and a married mother of four children.

Tampoco tiene d\u00edas definidos para salir, pero s\u00e1bados y domingos son muy buenos para obtener mejores ganancias.

She is 29 years old and lives with her common-law husband, Rodolfo.  They have two small children who are not old enough to attend school yet.\r\n\r\nWhile Rodolfo works as a bricklayer, Gaby (as she is known) sells plastic products from home such as spoons, fibers, clips, bows, bowls, etc.  Since she does not have a stable sales location some days of the week she goes out to the town square to sell her products.  The days are not fixed but Saturdays and Sundays are good days to earn more profit.  Gaby has been in this line of work for seven years in an effort to help her husband cover household expenses.  \"I started the business on my own initiative because many times we were unable to cover all the expenses with Rodolfo's earnings.\".\r\n\r\nGaby is very happy with her business because she loves being in contact with people.  Through her work she has made very good friends.  When she was single she never imagined having a business or selling in the streets \"but when we have children we are capable of anything to give them the best we can\".  Gaby had much support from her family who are also merchants.  They gave her recommendations about where to buy merchandise at the best price and how to develop her business.  Now she needs a loan to buy more products for the final months of the years which are when sales are high.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be of great help not only to Gaby but all the members of the group.

To take advantage of the celebration of the Day of the Dead she wants to buy flowers with a new loan.  On that day people usually take flowers and set up altars at the cemetery because of the belief that the dead enjoy one night a year feasting on the foods they enjoyed in life with their families.  \"I wanted to start selling flowers because a year ago I wanted some and could not find any because they were sold out so I was unable to take any to the cemetery\".

","en":"Mrs. Neliberta lives in a mazahua community. She's very proud of being from this community because people are very nice and help each other out. Mrs. Neliberta is no exception and she's very hardworking.  She has six children, three of them still in school, and in them she has found inspiration to keep working. \r\n\r\nThree years ago Neliberta decided to start with the breeding and feeding of calves and pigs. \"Fortunately five of my children decided to study but the expenses were increasing so I decided to do something about it\", said Neliberta.  The animals grow quickly and within 4-6 months she can start making profits although the feed is very expensive. Neliberta has very good clients and likes the activity that has allowed her to support her children.  Of course, she also speaks very proudly of her children.  One of them is already married and has a family. Two of them work for governmental agencies, and two others are studying, nutrition and law respectively. The youngest one is still in middle school. \r\n\r\nNeliberta Is very happy and grateful to VisionFund and KIVA because with this loan she'll buy feed and more pigs and because with the previous loans she's been able to invest in improving the quality of life for her children.

In this way Edgar takes advantage of the season or the holidays of the year to move his products.  His commercial store is open every day at 8 AM and closes at 7PM.  He sells his products to neighbors and passersby for cash and thus manages a good return on his investment.  \r\n\r\nThis business is located in a neighbrohood of the city of Soledad.  It is an area much visited by people who are current customers; also many of these are part of his potential customer group.   Edgar wants to buy Christmas items, clothing and shoes, since he should stock these at this time of year since this is when the sale of those products increases and one earns bigger profits in proportion.   The Mario Santo Domingo Foundation is  providing a loan, since Edgar asked for it in this way, to provide capital for his business so he can make his purchases, taking advantage of the season.  Edgar's challenge is to increase his business capital; then he can have his own business location and home.

The group consists of eleven rural poor women members who belong to Below Poverty Line. This group is located in a rural village named Kutrabeda of Nuapada district of Odisha, India. \r\n\r\nRasmita is one of the members of this group. The lady standing fourth from the right with a raised hand is Rasmita. She is a very active and young lady of 21 years of age. She lives with her husband and one child of 1.5 years. Rasmita is very much keen to contribute some income to her family by doing a business of her own.\r\n\r\nThe main income source for Rasmita is procurement of paddy during the harvesting season at a cheap rate and selling it when the rate is high. Her husband moves to weekly markets and procures paddy from the farmers. He does this work for three months (December through February), which is mainly the harvesting season for paddy. Apart from this, Rasmita has also a general grocery store in her house, which is being directly managed by her. \r\n\r\nFrom the above two businesses, Rasmita earns an average monthly income of 6,000 INR. According to her, this little income is insufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family, as well as for procurement of paddy in bulk. So, to develop her livelihood status, she wants to earn some extra income by investing more in her existing business. Hence, she will utilize the present loan of 12,000 INR for procurement of paddy and to purchase lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, shampoo, salt, etc. for the general store. She expects a good return from this investment, as this is the right time for this business. \r\n\r\nRasmita dreams to develop her general store into a big one and save some money for the better education of her child. \r\n\r\nOut of the other ten members, eight members are doing vegetable and paddy cultivation, and two members are running general grocery shops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1735271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for procurement of paddy and purchase lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, shampoo, salt, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KUTRABEDA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T18:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T18:50:01Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ambika        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bedamati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanchala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dusila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatumati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nrupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rasmita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sadani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":168000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T20:30:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":798875,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana is a 48-year-old single mother with three daughters, two of whom are independent.

Her husband\u2019s pay has been supporting them well, but they are trying to find other ways to support their children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nBefore Ruma, Muzainah was a stay-at-home housewife, taking care of her children. Three months ago, Muzainah met a Ruma agent, Ahmad, who introduced the mobile airtime business to her. Muzainah got excited to join Ruma, which empowers micro-entrepreneurs with technology to provide access to financial and informational services. \r\n\r\nAs a new business, Muzainah has the advantage of selling to most of the women in her community \u2013 she is a friendly and sociable person. Most of her customers are her own female neighbors who have also adopted mobile phones.  As the business runs, Muzainah hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile phone airtime transactions. In the future, Muzainah plans to add more mobile services to her community, such as utility bill payment service. In the photo, Muzainah is pictured in her house. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1735304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to have working capital to process mobile services in her community on the weekends","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Jakarta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muzainah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":984.9,"local_amount":12000000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":12204000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.1,"payment_id":752247674}],"funded_date":"2014-11-20T12:36:43Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T18:06:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":799012,"name":"Perlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perlita works hard to support her family.

Meet Arif. Arif owns and manages a small shop that sells mobile phone airtime credits. Arif is happily married, and he and his wife have been blessed with one daughter. Together, this small family lives in Lebak, a rural area located on the west coast of Java.\r\n\r\nTo support his family\u2019s needs, Arif decided to join Ruma three months ago. He is excited to do business as a Ruma agent, not only because he can raise his income by selling mobile phone airtime credits, but also because he can learn more about mobile technology use for businesses. By being a Ruma agent, Arif is able to give impact to his community. People had to go to some distance to find a mobile phone airtime kiosk and wait in line. But Arif is their neighbor and people can visit easily without wasting much time. \r\n\r\nNow, that the demand for mobile airtime is increasing (especially on the weekends), Arif is applying for the working capital loan from Kiva in order to process more airtime transactions. In the near future, Arif plans to add more products from Ruma to the things he sells, such as utility bill payment service and product catalogue service to his community. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1735307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to access working capital to provide mobile services in his community on the weekends","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Lebak","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhammad Arif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":12000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":984.9,"local_amount":12000000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":12204000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.1,"payment_id":752247675}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T15:41:12Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T18:06:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":799024,"name":"Ave","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Ave works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fishing vending business in the Philippines, and also earns income from food vending.
