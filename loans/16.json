V..  She is 39, single, and has a 12-year-old son in his second year of high school.  She aims to keep making money and maintain her customer base as she is a single mother and the only person working in her family.  She has had to work hard to raise her son as her situation does not allow her to work where she would make a higher income.  She wants to expand her business, to stop working as a street vendor and to open a store in her own home.  She dreams of educating her son, that he will have a career to fall back on so that he will be able to take care of himself.  She also wants to stop working for others; she wants to dedicate herself full-time to her business.\r\n\r\nClaudia sells a variety of goods such as cosmetics, purses, shoes, perfumes in the street.  She has been a street vendor for seven years.  She started this business when she found herself alone, abandoned and unable to count on anyone else's help. There was not enough money to care for her son and her household expenses: she had to find a way to survive.  Since then, she has overcome a number of obstacles and she hopes to make progress with the help of this loan, which will be working capital to buy a number of products such as watches, bracelets, earrings, clothing among others for which she will have to travel to Managua, Chinandega and Le\u00f3n to satisfy her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now he works in the public transportation sector, which at least provides him with steady work.

He has two young children, aged ten and eight.  They have lived in the same rental house for a long time and own a property in a nearby locality.  Marcial has worked as a truck driver for over ten years.  For about four years, he has driven his own vehicle as a taxi to supplement his income.  Meanwhile, his wife has her own business selling food from their home.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of competition in heavy cargo transport, but due to his years of experience, Marcial is a highly solicited driver.  As for his taxi service, it is also very competitive, but there is high demand for taxis because they offer a faster means of transport.  In the food business, the competition is tough, but Marcial's wife has an established customer base due to her food's flavor and her good customer service.\r\n\r\nThis loan is going to be used for vehicle repair and maintenance.  Because of the car's age, the parts it has need to be checked.  Marcial has only had loans with AgroCapital, and his payment history has been good to excellent.  It should be noted that Marcial did not want to look at the camera in the photo shown; he is the man seated playing poker.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva

He has done this for the last fifteen years and as a result of his good persuasive skills and good organization, he has got himself a good ready market for his bananas at his stall in Karambi.\r\n\r\nWith this experience behind him, Patrick knows nothing can hinder him in his endeavor to expand. Among the challenges that have caused a threat to him in the course of operating this business, has been the ever-fluctuating local market price of bananas. He has relied on his resilience to get him through this, however.\r\n\r\nAt present, Patrick makes profits amounting to 120,000 shillings a week.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years, and is making great strides. She has been able to earn a decent and honest living through milk and egg selling, and personal business. These ventures have enabled her to support her family. Priscilla has planted many trees on her compound, and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed her dairy cows, thereby enhancing her milk-selling profits. Because of increased demand, Priscilla is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and she wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Priscilla is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in her area. Through increased profits, she is sure that she will repay the loan on time and also be in a position to comfortably take care of her family. Priscilla, with her entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that she can achieve her dream of owning her own business and empowering society by being a source of employment. Juhudi Kilimo, through its training, has helped Priscilla save more effectively, and through her accumulated profits, she plans to add value to her milk through packaging. She also hopes to one day start manufacturing milk products such as yogurt and

For more than 8 years, he has traveled to the capital of Managua to purchase different products that some businesses in the city of Bluefields order from him.  He obtains a profit that has allowed him to pay for his home's expenses.  In this business, his main customers are barber shops in the city to whom he brings lotions, hair clippers, and razors, which are used in hair cuts and shaving.  Another sector that se\u00f1or M. supplies are some jewelers, to whom he mainly sells silver and stones to make rings.  In the same way, many people like cabinet makers order files, saws, and other products from him to avoid making a trip to the capital themselves.<p>\r\nOn every one of these orders, M. makes a small profit that allows him to pay for his basic needs.  Nevertheless, he needs financing to be able to fill all of his orders, to make larger profits, and to continue developing his business.  He is requesting this loan to purchase 250 grams of silver at $1 per gram, 10 scientific calculators at $7 each, 4 razors at $15 each, and 4 hair clippers at $30 each.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nEl se\u00f1or Oscar Antonio M. tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado con 3 hijos y desde hace mas de 8 a\u00f1os se dedica a viajar a la capital Managua con el objetivo de comprar diferentes productos que les encargan algunos negocios de  esta ciudad de Bluefields y en donde obtiene una ganancia que le a permitido sufragar los gasto de su hogar. En este negocio sus principales clientes son barberos de esta ciudad a quienes les trae lociones, cuchillas de barbero, navajas las cuales  utilizan en los cortes de cabellos y afeitadas. Otro sector que abastece el se\u00f1or M. son algunas joyer\u00edas a las cuales les vende principalmente plata y piedras para anillos. De igual manera algunas personas como los ebanistas para evitarse viajar a la capital les hacen encargos de limas, sierras entre otros productos.<p>\r\nEn cada uno de estos encargos el comerciante M. obtiene una peque\u00f1a ganancia que le permite pagar sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas, sin embargo  requiere un financiamiento para poder cumplir con todos sus encargos y poder obtener mayores ganancias e irse desarrollando en este negocio.

A. is 22 years old, married, and a mother with two children. One of her children is in school whilst the last born is breastfeeding. Esther lives with her husband at Wasa Asamang in the western region of Ghana. She dropped out of school because no one was there to support her. For that reason she decided to hook up with a man who could provide for her basic needs, and she got herself pregnant.<P>\r\n\r\nShe has been selling cocoa drink and sachet mineral water for the past two years now. Cocoa drink is prepared with powdered cocoa; water is added to it with sugar and then it is left in a fridge for a while and it is served whilst chilled and is taken with bread.

Her income is now around $230, even though she started with a third as much money. She obtains her children\u2019s help when needed. It does not undermine the courage and determination that she possesses.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Now Batyi is preparing a dowry for her daughter, whom she wants to marry off next year.

She is 38 years old. Marites is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marites owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling rice and corn in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marites joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Marites is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 14th loan taken out by Marites from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

is 21 years old; she lives with her partner, Juan Carlos, in the indigenous community of Suretka near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nGricelda has a business selling merchandise in her community. She spends her days knocking on doors, offering various products such as perfumes, clothing, sandals, cosmetics and other household items to potential customers. She is a hardworking individual which is exhibited through her initiative to complete high school by attending night classes.\r\n\r\nGricelda is applying for a loan of 200,000 colons. With this loan she plans to purchase more products for sale and hopes to secure a better price from her suppliers through larger purchases. This will be her second loan with Fundacion Mujer; her first loan was paid back, on time and in full, in a short six months. This loan will enable her business to grow and take her closer to her dream of one day being able to open a store from where she could sell products, allowing her to travel less.\r\n\r\nGricelda\u2019s main challenges are logistical. In order to purchase raw materials, she must travel to a town called Chasse. The town is not very far away, in absolute terms, but it is separated from Suretka by a large river. The river water travels at high speed which makes crossing dangerous, especially during the rainy season. Gricelda says that her main challenge is getting from her village, Suretka, to the location of her supplier, in Chasse. Buses are infrequent; Gricelda often ends up making the trip on foot which is a laborious task to say the least.\r\n\r\nIndigenous rural areas such as Suretka are characterized by many difficulties such as a lack of job opportunities, infrastructural deficiencies, low levels of formal education and lack of available financial services. Additionally, despite her entrepreneurial spirit, Gricelda\u00b4s efforts have been hamstrung due to her exclusion from the traditional banking system. This is where you, through Kiva\u2019s lending model, can help. Your loan is a direct investment in the improvement of living conditions of a woman living in a poor Indigenous community of Caribbean Costa Rica. By lending to Gricelda, a proactive and hard working entrepreneur, you are enabling her to take the first steps on a path that leads to the end of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":438925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She sells every day without a single day of rest. She leaves to sell her products at 8 am and works until 8 pm.

In the future, Junita plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

With the rest of the money, he will repair the motorcycle which he owns in order to use it for transport and have another means of generating an income.\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":280551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Consturction of a kiosk and purchase of kitchen utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-05T11:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":161.74},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":168.42},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":178.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":181.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":191.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.87},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":205.32},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":213.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.22,"local_amount":161.74,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":167.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117224},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":168.42,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":174.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012135},{"amount":56.54,"local_amount":178.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":185.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595720},{"amount":57.45,"local_amount":181.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":188.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989983},{"amount":60.6,"local_amount":191.38,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":198.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211114},{"amount":63.29,"local_amount":199.87,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":207.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640616},{"amount":65.02,"local_amount":205.32,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":212.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080149},{"amount":67.55,"local_amount":213.28,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":221.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996441}],"funded_date":"2009-03-06T03:13:10Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":96752,"name":"Mildre Olivia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n LA Sra.

Josephine is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Josephine from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She opens her store very early in the morning, eagerly awaiting her customers. She is a very cheerful and attentive seller who always receives everyone with a smile and is willing to help them shop. <p>\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is being able to converse with her customers. She has been in business for 27 years, and she thinks that the most difficult thing for her is having to stay in her store all day long without being able to leave. In the future, she would like to expand her store and fill it with more goods so that she can offer her customers a wider selection of products. <p>\r\nThis is Justina's first loan with MFP. However, she is willing to make her payments punctually, stating that responsibility is very important to her.

Starting at a young age gave him excellent experience as a car electrician, enabling him to start his own workshop which has a very good number of clients by this time.\r\n\r\nRamadan came to FATEN to take a loan which will enable him to purchase needed equipment. He is also thinking of expanding his workshop by using the space next to it to be able to serve an increased number of clients.\r\n\r\nRamadan's workshop is located at the entrance to the refugee camp which is a good location to serve both the refugee camp and some Ramallah city clients.\r\n\r\nRamadan looks forward to building his career and starting his family using the project's

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON International's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband is an employee with a meager salary, Samar and her husband managed to save money and open a clothes store for their son Muhammad who appears in the picture here instead of his mother as she is a conservative woman.\r\n\r\nSamar took out a loan from FATEN to pay for clothes her son imported from Egypt as he wants to increase the profit and have the chance to expand the display space for clothes in the store. The store is located in one of the city center shopping streets.\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. \r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

They are a couple who have a great desire to get ahead and are very entrepreneurial. This is their first loan under this program. With the money from the loan, they will buy the stand and in this way be able to improve their income. They are very thankful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust provided through the granting of the loan.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

N. is 17 years old and lives in the town of Natete in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  She is single and has one child, who is not yet in school.  Prossy runs a hotel, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Prossy has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more stocks of food, such as rice and beans, for the hotel's use.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Prossy hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food.  In the future, Prossy hopes to go back to school. Prossy is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by learning how to play new games and sharing experience. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

He is married and has five children. After getting married, he arduously dedicated himself to farming. When he recognized the need to invest in his work, Mirgasim decided to raise seasonal fruits and vegetables. He sells his products in the local bazaar, earning an income of about $375 to $500 a month. He started his business in 1985 but he applied for his first loan in 2008.

is a woman, who despite the hardships she\u2019d had to face, showed herself to be strong in the face of adversity. Despite her fortitude, it took all her strength and one thought\u2026to not let her self break under the circumstances. Thanks to that thought, she was able to recuperate after not only an operation she had two years ago, but also being abandoned by her husband.

For the past 2 years, she has run a restaurant located close to the bus stop of 2 bus lines; this provides her with greater demand for her food during lunch where she generally serves about 50 people per day.  This is a great incentive because she receives the earnings of her arduous, tiring work which consists of going to the city wholesale market every morning to purchase ingredients, then prepare, season, and cook, open the restaurant, and tend to the customers during lunch.  Fortunately, her parents help her during the busy lunch hours.  Afterwards, she has to do the cleaning.  In this way, Madali guarantees that her customers return because she is always aware of the need to serve hygienic, flavorful food.  \r\n\r\nMadali is thinking of getting a more commercial location for her restaurant nearer the city center and hopes to offer a greater variety and quantity of dishes.  This is the first loan she has requested from Prisma Microfinance and her commitment is such that she has assumed the presidency of the internal organization of her village bank.

She lives in Musang mankon, a quarter in Bamenda in the Northwest Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nShe has encountered difficulties in life ranging from the inability to provide for her daily needs to the failure to attain quality education. She also reiterates how happy she was when she gave birth to a set of twins. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Shirri plans to invest in the business of buying and selling of foodstuffs like cocoa yams, yams, corn, potatoes and beans. She is convinced that the business will succeed because this is not her first time receiving a loan from GHAPE and investing in the same business, and also that the previous investment was successful. The loan will help her community because she will be able to provide general provisions in the form of food items. Her neighbors will not need to incur transportation costs to buy them elsewhere in distant places. \r\n\r\nWith her income from the business she will be able to take care of her children\u2019s education. She will plow back her profits into her business and use part to care for her family. She will use a fraction of the profit to upgrade her standard of living. She also wants to open a workshop for her son. \r\n\r\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, and also that GHAPE does not ask for collateral securities, and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan, and that payment is gradual.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":594951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase general provisions to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Over the years, he has been focused on strengthening the family business - cattle sales - so he can provide for his children. With the experience he has gained over the last 15 years in business, he has been able to grow his business and bring stability to his family.  \r\n<p>\r\nRahimdjon has a friendly family who always try to help each other. In the photo, you can see his wife who helps him with the business. Now Rahimdjon has decided to build his own business raising animals. He will care for the animals for a short period of time and then sell them at his city's large stock shows. Therefore, he has requested 4,000 Somoni ($1,200 USD) for the term of 5 months. \r\n<p>\r\nRahimdjon has already received one loan from Kiva. Thanks to his previous loan, he was able to increase the number of cows he cared for and improve his business. Rahimdjon is counting on your help once again and thanks you very much for your love and support. \r\n<p> \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
