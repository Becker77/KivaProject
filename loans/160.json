She lives in her own house along with her 3 children, Johan who is 19, Lisbeth of is 17, and Cristian who is 8 years old, who are the motivation for her efforts. At approximately 6 in the morning Carmen opens her store to attend to her clients, who know that this is the first store to open in her neighborhood and run to buy to things they need. She attends to their needs very well and is always very courteous with the people because she knows that the success of her business depends on them. What she likes the most about her work is talking with her clients and learning about things that are happening in her neighborhood. She has worked for 12 years in the business and considers the most difficult part to be having to stay inside her store all day without being able to leave. For the future she longs to be able to grow her business and be able to give her clients better service. \r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's second loan with MFP and hopes to pay it back on schedule, because she does not want to cause problems with other members of her community bank where she is very respected due to the order that she imposes on the group.

enterprises. She is married to Dario G., a farmer.  She is a diligent and careful mother of two children.\r\nMyrna's husband's income is not enough to meet the needs of their family. Therefore, in 2005, Myrna got the idea of joining ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She was given hope and a way to have access to capital, so she started her printing business. The business went smoothly and brings them good income. She is also involved in the farming business and they help each other in running their family businesses.\r\n\r\nCurrently on her sixth loan, Myrna proposes the amount of Php 30,000 as additional capital to purchase stock and more supplies for her printing business. Stock includes items such as T-shirts for printing, assorted paints, and silk; the loan will also be use for purchasing fertilizer for their farming business.\r\n\r\nMyrna has disciplined herself to use all of the borrowed capital from ASHI-KIVA for her business, in order to gain more profit and to use that profit to support daily expenses.\r\n\r\nShe has been an ASHI member for four years (4).  ASHI paved the way for the achievement of the dreams of her family, to send her children to school and to finish their studies with a degree. She also hasn't stopped dreaming for her grandchildren, and wants to offer them the best education, such as she provided for her children. The couple feels very happy with the loan that made their lives to be better than before. Myrna wishes all lenders all the best and good luck and will continue to support her family and the expanded business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":449100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

her community. She is 43 years old, married and has two school-age children. They are from the village of Gud, San Isidro, Isabela. Flora has been in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Flora joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Flora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase products to sell. Flora is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nFlora is the leader of a 12 member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Flora U.'s Group\".\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Together, they live in a densely populated neighborhood in the north of the city. For more than 14 years, she has worked selling a well-known brand of beauty products. She says she began the business just for fun, and then several years passed, and currently she not only obtains good profits from her sales, but also is able to attract new clients and sellers to offer the brand. What she likes most about her job is offering a variety of products and recommending the cosmetics that best suit her customers. She reports that she does not like walking a lot in search of new customers, but the incentives she receives from the company are very motivating for her. She finds the work pleasant, and she obtains a steady income which allows her to live comfortably. In the future, she plans to increase the number of products she offers to her customers, since she would like to increase her earnings. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and once again she promises, as in previous opportunities, to be punctual in making her payments, since she wants to continue working in her quest to get ahead. In addition, she is very grateful to all of those people who made the loan possible. Mar\u00eda plans to invest the loan she is requesting in buying a larger quantity of merchandise, including beauty products and perfumes, in addition to accessories, since she has a number of pending orders to fill.

She is now preparing to invest once more, to take advantage of mothers\u2019 day, which is close, and which is busy throughout the entire month.  Dayra still recalls, when she started up, how they brought merchandise to her house, under a credit arrangement.  She would sell cologne, perfume, clothing.  Now she buys directly, and her earnings are higher, because her prices are lower, and she can choose what she needs, and the quality she wishes to offer her customers.  They enjoy lower prices, and she gains their loyalty.  Dayra recognizes that, with her loans from Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she has gradually been achieving her goals, but through very hard work and strict discipline.  Thus, with her second kiva loan, she will buy cosmetics, women\u2019s clothing, small appliances, accessories, and footwear, which will increase her sales and bring her new customers.  This, as she continues to work to improve their living conditions, as she has been doing slowly to help her 20-year-old son get ahead.  She hopes to see her highest goal achieved, that is, that he will be successful in the not-too-distant future.

He is 47 years old and he is a hard working man. He lives in a house which he owns together with his wife, Fernandina, 46 years old, and their three beloved children.  They live together in the community of Palestina Baja in the district of Kimbiri. Edmundo is a man of great pleasure and he works in his business with great care. His work consists of working the land. He is an agriculturist and he has 4 hectares of land where he cultivates cocoa, coffee, and peanuts. He has been in the business for 20 years and he is well acquainted with the arduous work involved in agriculture. During the harvest seasons he seeks the help of farm hands who help him collect the products. His most profitable plants are the peanuts and cocoa because they are in highest demand by the national distributors. They pay very well for each kilogram which is exported. The problem that he sees with his business is that he is unable to combat the insects that harm the products.

The family is always figuring out another way to make a few quetzals. She's in her first credit cycle with Friendship Bridge and is a member of the women's group \"Puente de Amistad\". The loan will be used as working capital to buy more products for the store and to sell in the Sunday market. Maria has great hopes for her five children. All of them have prospered in school and she's hoping they'll have distinguished careers involving good houses and professions, and that maybe they'll have computers. In the past four years she has had some significant back problems, and despite many visits to specialists, she's had no relief.

belongs to the Teresa Ramos community bank.  She lives in the Peruvian \"departamento\" of Ucayali.  She's 29 years old and the mother of 3 young children.  Her husband is a mechanic, but his income doesn't cover all of the family's expenses so Llesica, with her first loan from Manuela Ramos of S\/.300 (300 Peruvian soles or about US$100) decided to set up a poultry business.  Llesica tends to her business with great care and dedication.

Her husband Renato E., who is 44 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activity.  They have one child who is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nDelia  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to buy yeast, oil, sugar, margarine, etc. so that she can continue to save up for future tuition for her children and for house repair. \r\n\r\nDelia  E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They live in a two-room apartment in the Tumuku Belo subdivision. Jacob had a lot of difficulty in providing for his six children, so in 2010 he was introduced to GHAPE by his friend, who was a member. He had his first loan of 50,000 XAF, which he used to purchase goats and to farm. \r\n\r\n<p>Jacob is requesting a second loan to buy seven goats for 75,000 XAF, beans for 22,500 XAF and corn for 32,500 XAF. He knows that he will succeed since he has enough land to graze his goats and to farm. Jacob is satisfying the high demand for goats in his community and thus helping the community. He was challenged when his son failed his certificate exam. Jacob will use the profit from this loan to pay his children's tuition fees and to repay his loan. Jacob took a loan from GHAPE because the interest rates are low and repayment is bit by bit.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

P., 37 years old, lives in the municipality of Soyapango. Her family is composed of her husband and two sons, ages 9 and 7, that are studying. She has been selling juices and smoothies from her home for the last 20 years. This business has allowed her to be able to offer her husband the help he needed with the household expenses such as the children's education and food. \r\n<p>\r\nRosa asks for a loan with which she can purchase more fruits and milk for the juices and smoothies, as well as purchasing two new blenders, because the ones she owns are quite well worn already. Rosa hopes to increase the business' profit, since one of her new year's resolutions is to excel herself in her job and to offer her children a better life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

To make a living, Deona Ann owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.

Deona Ann has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Deona Ann is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to pay for services to increase crop yield. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Deona Ann from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Emilia, her husband and her son look after the crops, watering them and applying fertilizers.  When the time comes to harvest the coffee, they provide work to some people in their community.  After harvesting, they sell the coffee.  Emilia tells us that they used to sell their coffee to a gentleman who owned a grinder but he closed down a couple of years ago and now they sell their produce within their own community and in some other nearby communities.  They sometimes sell coffee cherries (which is when the coffee is mature) and sometimes they sell the beans.\r\n\r\nEmilia needs this loan to invest in fertilizers for her crops.  She tells us that she hopes to continue working in the future because the financial situation is very hard these days and you can only get ahead in life by working.\r\n\r\nSome of the people who appear in this photo are friends and neighbors who were present when the photo was taken and wanted to appear in it.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: \r\n\r\nSenorina - snack sales\r\nCamerina - clothing sales\r\nMaria Lucrecia - grocery sales\r\nEva - grocery sales\r\nYuridia - nutrition club\r\nRosalia - grocery sales\r\nEulalia - shoe sales\r\nElodia -  catalog sales\r\nDora maria - clothes store\r\nGenoveva - shoe sales"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":722657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to grow coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El cedro, tezonapa, ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-26T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4100,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cenoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Camerina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lucrecia Justa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuridia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elodia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Dora Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":410,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4802.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233888},{"amount":820,"local_amount":9600,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":9605.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512724},{"amount":820,"local_amount":9600,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9605.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223370},{"amount":1230,"local_amount":14400,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":14408.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201647},{"amount":820,"local_amount":9600,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9605.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807245}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T18:53:52Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":306381,"name":"Chapeline","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Chapeline est n\u00e9e le 03 mars 1972 au B\u00e9nin et est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un  agent de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 B\u00e9ninoise d\u2019Electricit\u00e9 et d\u2019Eau, du nom de Patrice.

Lourdes y su familia esperan tu pronta respuesta."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":67349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Lourdes wants to increase the size of her convenience store and add more computers to provide more services and comfort to her demanding customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-09-21T16:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-05T18:37:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-11-05T10:24:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":76732},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-12-05T10:27:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":91812},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-01-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":109681},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-02-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-03-05T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":150058},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-04-05T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-05T10:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":174470}],"funded_date":"2007-09-21T18:37:47Z","paid_date":"2008-04-05T10:13:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":22828,"name":"Chandra Bedi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chandra Bedi M. is a 40 year old woman and she lives in Thecho.

Only he and his wife live at home. Ever since he was young, he has worked in agriculture, growing hectare upon hectare of potatoes. However, ever since he noticed that his daughter was prosperous in raising guinea pigs, he decided to enter this field. His daughter then gave him some of her guinea pigs, and he enthusiastically built cages for them. Now that his neighbors know that he is raising guinea pigs, they order some from him. When his daughter travels, he takes advantage of it, sending her however many guinea pigs she can sell. He also helps his daughter to cultivate her farm. Growing crops is difficult, which is why he only does it for personal consumption. Raising guinea pigs, on the other hand, is more lucrative. This is his second loan with MFP. He has made his payments punctually. With this loan, he will purchase barley for planting, which serves as food for the rodents. He will also purchase fertilizer for his potato farm with the other part of the loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":230181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer and plant barley for guinea pig food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-24T20:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116407}],"funded_date":"2008-11-25T01:49:09Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":80195,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norma is a member of the Sumaq Huayta Village Bank; \u201cSumaq Huayta\u201d means \u201cBeautiful Flower\u201d in Quechua.

Kurbon is married. His wife is a homemaker and they have a two-year-old child. \r\n\r\nHe has always been a hard worker. He started working at an early age, helping his mother with her clothing business, and contributing his earnings to them from the time that he was 15 years old. When Kurbon married, his expenses increased and he had to strike out on his own to build a business that would support his own family. With the help of his father, he started his own clothing-sales business and his wife helped him in her spare time. His business has grown little by little but he wants to continue to grow in order to better quality of life. \r\n\r\nKurbon is asking for a $800 USD loan to buy merchandise for his business so that he can continue to expand it. He is offering to repay the loan in 12 months. He and his family are very grateful for the support you are providing to help them get ahead. \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 34 years old. Elsie is single. To make a living, Elsie operates a family member's business running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Elsie has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 15,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elsie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Elsie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

They have two daughters, both still in their care.  With his wife's help, Wilberto has operated a business selling clothing for 6 years.  He travels around looking for original clothing items, of good quality, to stock his business and resell.  Over time, he has managed to gain the trust of his customers and he is now well known both for the affordable cost of his clothing and for the variety of items he can sell.  In the future, he wants to have a large stall at some well-trafficked market where he can sell his merchandise and, in turn, improve his family's income.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Estela has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of  14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 11,200 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing 14,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase a fishing net so that she is able to continue to save up for the future education of her granddaughter and for house repair. \r\n<br>Estela A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\n<b> About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable').

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling bamboo mats & mattresses to tourists and local community members. Edgar has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Edgar joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edgar is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials like bamboo. This will be the first loan taken out by Edgar from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

He works in a small restaurant which serves all sorts of food. He likes his work and stands out in it due to his attention to detail, the cleanliness of his establishment, the quality of his work and his friendliness. Since 1974 he has been running this business and has a lot of experience. He started his business cooking the national dish of sambusa (meat in dough). Today he rents a place at the market of \u201cSakhovat\u201d in the central park. He wants to cooperate with Imon International as he would like to extend around his house to be able to cook there and attract more clients. For this purpose, he has requested a loan. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and marking the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ahora Sonia ha decidido comprar al por mayor el ma\u00edz y az\u00facar necesarios para preparar sus tortillas y refrescos respectivamente a f\u00edn de bajar el costo de sus materias primas y adem\u00e1s poder hacer mayor cantidad de ambos productos que a la fecha ya no abastecen suficientemente a sus clientes que la prefieren por su higiene, responsabilidad y amabilidad. Son \u00e9stas razones por las que decidi\u00f3 solicitar a INTEGRAL cr\u00e9dito y confiada en que a trav\u00e9s de ello obtendr\u00e1 mayores ganancias y mejorar\u00e1 la calidad de vida de su familia.-","en":"Sonia, 51, lives in her own home with her two grown daughters.  They help Sonia with her business, which is located in the same place as her residence.  She sells drinks and she also makes tortillas that she sells outside of a supermarket that is close to her house.  She also delivers the tortillas at lunchtime to the employees who work in the commercial area that surrounds the neighborhood where she lives.  Sonia has had these businesses for a number of years, and it has been through this hard work that she has managed to provide for her daughters.  Every day Sonia and her daughters get up very early.  Sonia makes her purchases in the market close to her neighborhood, buying the supplies she needs to make the drinks, including ingredients for horchata (a drink made of rice, almonds and cinnamon), tamarind, melon, barley, and other items.  Meanwhile, her daughters stay in the kitchen cooking the corn that they will later take to grind to prepare the delicious tortillas.  Now Sonia has decided to buy the corn and sugar she needs to make her tortillas and drinks at wholesale.  This way she can lower the cost of her ingredients and also have a greater quantity of both products on hand, because at this point her she does not have enough of these products.  Sonia's customers prefer her business because of her hygiene, responsibility and friendliness.  For all of these reasons she has decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL; she is confident that through this loan she will be able to have greater earnings and  improve the quality of life of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":798818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn and sugar at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-06-28T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":57.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62.61},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":64.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88.37,"local_amount":88.37,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":88.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221612983},{"amount":45.75,"local_amount":45.75,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":45.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226982260},{"amount":47.07,"local_amount":47.07,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T07:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":47.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233430890},{"amount":48.98,"local_amount":48.98,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":48.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238545863},{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":49.82,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":49.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505460},{"amount":54.64,"local_amount":54.64,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":54.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250712940},{"amount":53.25,"local_amount":53.25,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":53.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257115804},{"amount":53.98,"local_amount":53.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":53.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263240934},{"amount":358.14,"local_amount":358.14,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":358.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269965897}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T10:33:11Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":314591,"name":"Carmelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Carmelo es artesano costurero, tiene un taller en la ciudad de El Alto.

of two children, whom she raised on her own and married off her daughter.  Marhamat's son works as a security guard at a market, and his monthly income is only 300 somoni, which is not enough to cover living expenses for himself and his mother.  This is why Marhamat works as a janitor at a sales office, and her income is 250 somoni.  But it is clear from this family's monthly income that the family is unable to start repairs of their apartment, and this is why Marhamat wants to use this loan to make repairs to her kitchen and use her income to gradually repay the loan on a monthly basis.  She is grateful to the organization for this opportunity to solve her family

He and his family live in the Las Ca\u00f1itas community in the department of Olancho. For 38 years, Emilio has grown coffee, corn, and beans. Currently he is continuing with the business, and he works with his children on the coffee farm. His work schedule is from 6:00 am until 2:00 pm. During harvest season he works all day, since there is plenty of work. One of the advantages he has is that he obtains good profits from growing coffee. The disadvantage is that sometimes the coffee is damaged by pests and lack of fertilizers. Emilio is asking for the loan in order to buy manure and fertilizers. He will also use the profits from his business to buy wood and improve his house, since he was able to get good earnings from selling the coffee. Emilio's goal is to make his farm grow in order to increase his earnings and improve the finances of his household.

This season she has planted mostly potatoes, followed by peas. Her planting is done on rented farmsteads. She works together with her husband, but he does not enjoy working in the fields as much as she does, so he focuses on harvesting and transporting their products to the local market, where they sell potatoes for 55 soles (about 17 cents US) a bag. \r\n\r\nLooking to the future, Livia wants to increase production so that in time she can buy land and construct her own home.

These workers strive towards the financial well-being of their family, and that is why they seek the support of Agrocapital (Kiva Field Partner), to have quick financing to have funds to invest in their business, and translate this into greater earnings. They are a very tight-knit group, knowing one another very well despite this being their first experience. Most of the members are in sales of products such as prepared foods, fruits, appliances, knitting crafts, milk, shingles, general groceries, and baked goods, as well as construction work and public transportation drivers. There is a great deal of competition but they all know how to pull through, especially because their families depend on them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika

She is 57 years old, single, and the mother of 3 children who are 29, 30, and 31 years old.  They each live in their own home.  She only studied through 2nd grade and did not continue because her parents made her work on a small farm and in a cattle pasture.  She lives in a rented house with a grandson and does not support anyone else besides him.\r\n\r\nShe lived in the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique from 1983 to 2003 when her husband worked in that part of the country.  She is a merchant and has owned her own business for more than 7 years.  She sells peanuts, oleo, beans, and brings in about 800 MZN per day, which she puts toward family expenses.  She even saves some through Xitique (a traditional system of revolving savings).\r\n\r\nShe has had four loans with the Credit Cooperative (CCP) but later decided to stop.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend (Mrs. Florinda Timane), who is a client of the institution.  This is her 2nd loan, which has a value of 10,000 MZN.  She would use this to buy products (beans, flour, peanuts, etc.) in order to expand and further diversify her merchandise.  Her previous loan of 5,000 MZN was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to request a loan to build a house, since she actually lives in a rented one.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

She is 44 years old and married with four school-aged children. To make a living, Letecia owns and operates a multi-cab service business in the local community, with her husband acting as driver. Letecia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Letecia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to invest in expanding the business. Letecia is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide business services. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Letecia from HSPFI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is separated from her husband, and lives in Calatrava, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. She has two children who are 14 and 17 years old.  \r\n\r\nAntonietta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonietta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000. \r\n\r\nFor her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for their future and her children's education. \r\n\r\nAntonietta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the community's respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her work is a major source of satisfaction, above all because she is able to provide necessities to her family, for whom she will work to improve her business.

Usapi Sonbai Village is situated about 29 Km from Kupang City. The community in this area leans on the agricultural sector to support their family lives. The main income comes from selling agricultural products such as bananas, coconuts and corn. There is no local market in this area, so the community has to get into the Inpres Market in Kupang City.\r\n\r\nSesawi A1 is led by Sem T., 32 years old. He is a married man.

The children are: Reman, 8 years old, in the 2nd grade of elementary school; Rali, 6 years old and Alfin, 2 months and not at school yet. \r\n\r\nTo meet his family's needs, Sem leans on the crops (coconut and cucumber). But usually, the income generated from selling the crops cannot cover all of their needs. He also has several goats that can be sold in an emergency.  Living as a farmer in a remote area really becomes a challenge for Sem. Lack of capital becomes the main issue for him to improve his living standard. This situation motivated Sem to join the TLM cattle-fattening program with a hope for a better future. His experience in raising goats for two years has given him the self confidence to join the program. Sem is requesting a loan of IDR 3,300,000 from TLM to buy young cattle to fatten in 12 months. He hopes that this loan will help him improve his living standard.

For a year, together with her son, she has rented a space next to her home where she has begun a business selling office supplies and operating an internet caf\u00e9.  Llerme decided to go into this business because in the area where she lives there are several law and accounting offices, and the people who work there are her principal customers.  This is not her only work, however.  She also works in an ice cream parlor, serving the public for 11 years.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that it is located near her house.  In addition, she likes giving good service to her customers and having pleasant conversations with them.  Furthermore, she considers her activities profitable because the first is her own business that provides her with daily income, and in the ice cream parlor she obtains secure pay on a monthly basis.

She is thankful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her start her business and develop as a businesswoman. \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Shimmin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":485922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fruits and vegetables to supply her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T16:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dory","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954548},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987574},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713600},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":418.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746646},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929817},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":418.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159668993}],"funded_date":"2010-02-19T05:38:07Z","paid_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Shimmin","image":null}},{"id":179156,"name":"Elsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsa C. is from the village of Pangantucan, Bukidnon.
