She is from Carmona, Cavite, Philippines, and she is one of the factory workers who benefits from CCT\u2019s employment assistance through Covenant Community Service Cooperative* and loan assistance through CCT Credit Cooperative.\r\n\r\nAmalia works as a Garment Manufacturing Supervisor. She directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Amalia is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Amalia is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for the educational expense of her two children who are in college.\r\n\r\nAmalia dreams for her children to be able to complete their studies and then find work that is suited to them. She wants them to have a good life in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1735315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is from Cavite, Philippines, and she is one of the factory workers who benefits from CCT\u2019s employment assistance through Covenant Community Service Cooperative* and loan assistance through CCT Credit Cooperative.\r\n\r\nRizalina works as a Garment Manufacturing Supervisor. She directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Rizalina is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Rizalina is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will add this loan to her beginning capital for a variety store business.\r\n\r\nRizalina wants her children to have good life in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1735319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To add to her capital to start her variety store business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-18T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-02T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rizalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535996},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134348},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757116},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200254},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186548},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535635}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T00:08:07Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":799035,"name":"Adioleta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adioleta works hard to support her family.

She is from Laguna, Philippines, and she is one of the factory workers who benefits from CCT\u2019s employment assistance through Covenant Community Service Cooperative* and loan assistance through CCT Credit Cooperative.\r\n\r\nMarchia works as a Garment Manufacturing Supervisor. She directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Marchia is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Marchia is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to any loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for the tuition fees of her children, one who is in elementary and the other is in secondary.\r\n\r\nMarchia hopes that she will be financially stable and free from any debt. She wants to have a good life in the future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.

He is entrepreneurial, responsible and hard working; he sells dairy products for a living in the community of Huayrocondo which is near Lake Titicaca. The climate is cold and dry and it is 3800 meters above sea level (approx 12,500 '). \r\n\r\nRomer has a dark complexion, is of medium height, and his mother tongue is Aymara, but he speaks Spanish too. He lives with his wife, who works in agriculture, and their three children who are dependent upon him. They live in their own house which is made of adobe, and they have electricity and well water. His occupation is making dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and cream, and he also sells milk. This is his second loan cycle with the institution in the six years he has been doing this work. His other occupation is a taxi service for which he uses his own car.\r\n\r\nRomer's dream is to improve his dairy business. He would like to invest in his business by buying dairy cattle so he can produce more milk for his customers. This is why Romer is applying for a loan - so he can buy dairy cattle to increase his production and his sales."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":413.52,"image":{"id":1728394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She has the idea of setting up a grocery store where her neighbors can find all the necessary products to feed their families.\r\n\r\nNormally the people in this community need to go to San Lorenzo [to buy groceries], a distance of four hours, taking advantage of the only regularly scheduled transportation that travels to this sector daily, when there are no problems with landslides on the route.\r\n\r\nHer children go to school and enjoy good health. She wants to serve her community and offer [her neighbors] the convenience of obtaining their products in the same town. From the fruit of her labor, she has managed to build her own house.

They don't have telephone signals or communication media such as television or radios, but it is a community that is considered one of the cleanest in the province of Esmeraldas.\r\n\r\nShe is

is a 23-year-old, single man, living with his family in Hodeidah city, Yemen. He has a University education, but he couldn't find a job to look after his family. He lives with his family in a very miserable condition. Mawia works hard to improve the living conditions of his family. He works as a driver, on a motorcycle that belongs to his friend, with a daily pay. That money which he receives from that work is not enough to cover the needs of Mawia's family. He thinks that, if he had his own motorcycle to work on, as a driver to transport people from one place to another, he would earn a good amount of money.

Boalngir district of Odisha, India. She is standing third from the right with her raised hand in the photo.  This village is located in an interior area with a distance of 130 kilometer from the district headquarters. Most of the families of this village belongs to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) class and depend on traditional paddy cultivation. Madhu hails from a traditional potter family. She resides in a nuclear family with her husband and one son of 18 months.\r\n\r\nDue to not much income from her conventional work of making and selling earthen pots, Madhu has given up the same and for the last six years, she has been running a general shop with ladies fancy items like bangles, talc, plastic items, cosmetics, etc. and daily use items like potatoes, onions, sugar, tea, soap, etc. in her house. Apart from this, her husband procures paddy and other seasonal cereals by moving to different weekly markets, which he sells in the off season to get some extra income. Presently, Madhu is earning a monthly income of 4,000 INR and at any rate, is managing her family. But she has a dream to come out from this paucity cycle and earn more to establish herself well in society. So she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase the income. This year, Madhu, along with 12 other like-minded women of her village, formed a group named Maa Bastaren and availed a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. With this loan of 16,000 INR, she wants to purchase more items like bangles, talc, plastic items, cosmetics, potatoes, onions, sugar, tea, soap, etc. Looking into the market situation of the village, she is very hopeful that this investment will help her to earn some extra income and by saving something, she will be able to construct a good cabin for her business and thinks of a better future for her child.\r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of this group are doing different types of business like milk-selling, a general store, an auto-repair center, tailoring etc. and wish to develop their enterprises from this loan. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1735412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

At the moment, Kulmira has 13 metric tons of potatoes in storage.  This is Kulmira's only source of income, and she'd like to increase her stock of potatoes before winter sets in.

She lives with her children in a small village where people mainly work in agricultural production and her family is not an exception. Indeed, their major source of income is from cultivation; breeding chickens, ducks and pigs. Her children, though, have graduated from college, but have still faced unemployment. For that reason, Mrs. Phuong wants to expand her animal husbandry to ensure enough income for living expenses as well as create work for her grown-up children before they could find other better jobs. Thus, she has taken out a loan from the Anh Chi Em Program to buy piglets and hopes that, with the training and counselling about raising pigs from the program, she will earn a high income. \r\n\r\nMrs. Phuong hopes her children will soon get a good job and have better living conditions. Phuong stands at the first from the right."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":1735671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Dien Bien","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":342,"posted_date":"2014-11-19T05:30:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-03T05:30:31Z","loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Hoan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Xuyen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Hue","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Huong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Phuong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Phuong","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Nghi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Huong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Huong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":61000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":61000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2875,"local_amount":61000000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-30T12:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":61259062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711470167}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T02:48:06Z","paid_date":"2015-09-30T12:10:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Courtenay Selden","image":null}},{"id":799181,"name":"Digna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Digna is 58 years old and married with eleven children.

La necesidad de expandir y ampliar su negocio la llevo a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; puesto de venta de comida, venta de refrescos, tienda de barrio, venta de blusas, venta de ropa de beb\u00e9, venta de papas fritas y venta de ropa deportiva, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y cumplir sus metas.\nSu negocio es la venta de artefactos de uso dom\u00e9stico, como; ollas, sartenes, planchas, cocinillas, jarras el\u00e9ctricas, etc., de manera ambulante. Su trabajo lo realiza de martes a domingo en mercados y diferentes ferias, empujando un carrito cargado de productos y un amplificador de sonido que repite las ofertas y productos ofrecidos, su forma ingeniosa de vender hace que su negocio sea pr\u00f3spero y rentable. Esta es la segunda secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en tres a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad. Su sue\u00f1o es tener una tienda fija para ya no seguir ambulando, y desea ampliar su oferta realizando la venta de materiales de temporada como; juguetes, disfraces, toallas, etc. para aprovechar las ventas de fin de a\u00f1o.\nEs por esos motivos que Yoana solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para ampliar su oferta con productos de temporada y aprovechar las ventas de fin de a\u00f1o.\n","en":"Yoana is 34 years old. She lives with her domestic partner. She has two children: a fifteen year old one and a four year old one. Her business is selling kitchen items. She is enterprising, constant, independent, responsible and hard working. She sells as a street vendor in the area of \u2018plan 3000\u2019, a place known for the constant growth in commerce in all areas, of warm humid climate with an approximate temperature of 30 degrees Celcius during the whole year. Yoana is of dark skin, medium height, long black hair, stocky. Her native language is Quechua and she speaks Spanish (in the middle, blue blouse, light blue purse, jeans). She lives with her partner who works painting interiors, and with her two children. The oldest one goes to school, and she takes care of the young one. Because of the need to expand and broaden her business, she formed a group of people with businesses such as: a stand to sell food, sale of drinks, neighborhood store, sale of blouses, sale of baby clothing, sale of french fries and sale of sport clothing, and applied with them for a loan to fulfill their goals. Her business is selling items of domestic use such as: pots, frying pans, irons, small stoves, electric jugs, etc. as a street vendor. She works from Tuesday to Sunday at markets and different fairs, pushing her little cart filled with products and with a sound amplifier to repeat the offers and the offered products. Her ingenious way of selling makes her business successful and profitable. This is her second loan cycle with the institution. She has been doing this job for three years. Her dream is to have a set store so she does not have to move around, and she would like to broaden her offerings by selling seasonal items such as: toys, costumes, towels, etc. to take advantage of end of year sales. This is why Yoana is requesting a loan in order to broaden her offers with seasonal items and take advantage of end of year sales. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":1726565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to broaden her offer with seasonal products and take advantage of end of year sales.

She is retired and earns extra income for her family through raising livestock and planting crops, which she began in 2008. Thanks to her hard work, she currently has two horses and three young bulls. She also leases a 2.0 hectare plot of land where she grows raspberries and strawberries to sell.

57, married, and has four children.

Thanks to her hard work she currently has three cows, two horses, and 17 sheep. She also has a 2.6 hectare plot of land where she plants barley and hay to use as feed for livestock. In order to develop her business, Sairakul applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to buy sheep to fatten and resell.

She has a cow and a pig and she milks the cow everyday to produce cheese to sell locally. As the income is only seasonal, she decided to start an additional stable business. The Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables her to get a loan of 1,200 GEL.

Later on, she hopes to be innovative with a new business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1729072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to maintain and repair her motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2014-11-19T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-03T19:50:06Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carla Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":510,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":119.65},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":125.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":129.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":135.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":119.65,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":120.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579528608},{"amount":42.95,"local_amount":125.18,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-31T10:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":125.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595127977},{"amount":44.56,"local_amount":129.87,"processed_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-10T10:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":130.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610523447},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":135.3,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-25T09:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":135.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624817546}],"funded_date":"2014-11-19T21:19:14Z","paid_date":"2015-03-25T09:37:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hasmin Sherwin"}},{"id":799342,"name":"Liliosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liliosa is a married woman with seven children.

remote village in the Chuka area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of three children sells milk, eggs, maize, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of her immense knowledge of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village.\r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow, and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit, and she is seeking a loan to build one.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow. A good dairy unit provides a sheltering place where cows can relax, and it also helps to protect them from diseases that may arise if they are exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.\r\n\r\nCaroline believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

has two children and is a hardworking, creative woman who wants to support herself using her own ideas so she does not have to ever rely on anybody else. She is a rural farmer in Chuka, Kenya an area known for having the best climate that supports farming. Juditah has been practicing mixed farming for 10 years. On her farm, she grows maize and has a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. When she is not farming, she engages in a side business to supplement the meager income she earns from farming. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meager earnings. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" \r\n\r\nJuditah requested a another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow and increase her dairy business. She is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Juditah formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that produces milk daily, which Juditah sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" said Juditah. The money Juditah earned from selling the milk was adequate to repay a loan. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Juditah is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer.

She makes a living selling clothes. She is strong; a fighter; entrepreneurial; active; responsible and hard-working. She performs her business at fairs and various markets in the 'Cruce Villa Adela' area; an area characterized for its cold and dry weather, with a constant temperature of 13 degrees centigrades throughout the whole year. Cristina has a dark complexion, long black hair, short, and her mother tongue is Aymara and she speaks Spanish (she is sitting at the center with a vicuna blanket). She has a life with her husband who works in plumbing and with her youngest daughter who studies at school. The rest of her children are independent, they live in their own homes made of brick and that have potable water, electricity and gas. \r\n\r\nHer desire to diversify her business led her to organize an entrepreneurship bank with people who work in businesses such as: selling tomatoes; weaving; selling fish; construction; machine knitting; selling empanadas; cosmetics trade; and seasonal clothing sales. All this in order to request a loan and to succeed in their commercial endeavors. Her business is that of selling clothes, previously she used to sell blankets and rugs but as time progressed, her products changed until only seasonal clothing was sold. This is the second sequence of loans with the organization in the 12 years that she has been working in this field. Her dream is to diversify her business, she wishes to buy clothes in bulk due to the end-of-the-year sales in order to generate greater benefits and to pay the school graduation expenses of her youngest daughter. These are the reasons why Cristina is requesting a loan to purchase clothes in bulk and with the benefits pay her youngest daughter's graduation expenses.

Only their youngest son lives with them. Lena works in a facility that produces cottage cheese and sour cream and also raises livestock as an additional source of income. She started her business in 2004 and currently has two cows, five sheep, five goats, and a horse. She is full of strength and energy to expand her business and do the work she loves because she needs to help her children.

Chynara has a higher education in the field of pedagogy and was a kindergarten teacher for many years. She is very responsible, precise and hardworking, and she considers the most important thing in her life to be her children. Searching for a source of additional income, Chynara began farming four years ago. She currently has three horses, a foal and 20 sheep. She also grows barley, hay and potatoes on a 1.025 hectare plot of land. The profits from her business allow her to raise livestock and stock up on feed for the winter.

lenders! Meet Ruth, a 42-year-old mother who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Kapomboi, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. She is happily married and has five children that depend on her for the basic needs. For the past sixteen years, she has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her major primary sources of income are milk, egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d \n\nShe sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and, because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound, and the demand has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand, she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity, and hence, satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used in improving her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from poultry manure, which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make her business flourish, and hence, provide a secure solid education to her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":266.94,"image":{"id":1729808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase quality poultry for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-19T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-03T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1720.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1770.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1822.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1930.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1986.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2044.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2104.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.18},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2229.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2294.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2361.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2430.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2501.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2574.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2650.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2727.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2807.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.61,"local_amount":2454.47,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2487.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194642},{"amount":44.21,"local_amount":3929.77,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3983.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824043},{"amount":195.12,"local_amount":17343.72,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":17580.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264532}],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T23:43:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":794990,"name":"Hakim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hakim is 25 years old and lives in the town of Kinobi in the Mubende region of Uganda.
