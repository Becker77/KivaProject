This business grew and helped her to sustain her family. This prompted her to mobilize her colleagues to form a group called Maboona Tutungukye group. They started different businesses, and with the help of Ugafode loans, their businesses have progressed. They are requesting a loan to help them increase their business working capital to improve their standards of living. \r\n\r\nJackline will use the loan to restock her food stall.

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like John, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1732018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more essential items to sell in his retail shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukoki","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.2 30.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2014-11-20T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-04T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":59.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":141027},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":146121},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":151398},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":156866},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":162531},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":168401},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174483},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":180784},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":187313},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":194078},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":103.93,"local_amount":277139,"processed_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":284241.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595124663},{"amount":25.25,"local_amount":67323,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":69048.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612146489},{"amount":107.68,"local_amount":287148,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":294506.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626569575},{"amount":56.77,"local_amount":151398,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-28T11:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":155277.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637610990},{"amount":41.65,"local_amount":111047,"processed_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":113892.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649529650},{"amount":58.95,"local_amount":168401,"processed_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-20T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":172716.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.2,"payment_id":666181343},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":174483,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":178954.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.05,"payment_id":681308304},{"amount":57.61,"local_amount":180784,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":185416.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.18,"payment_id":696517998},{"amount":64.09,"local_amount":208350,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":213689.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.04,"payment_id":711428222},{"amount":114.85,"local_amount":373927,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":383509.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.37,"payment_id":730950970}],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T22:52:59Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T13:30:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":799410,"name":"Ana Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Myrna  is 51 years old, married, the mother of three children and lives in Tukuran,  Zamboanga del Sur with her family.

is a hardworking mother of four who lives in Kapsumai location in the North Rift region of Kenya. She is a hardened crop farmer who is struggling with farm-related expenses. She has been doing this work for three years. Grace noted that the crop's performance is heavily reliant on external factors such as weather. For this reason, farmers usually realize they have lost a great percentage of their crops during harvest.\n\nTo make the investment worthwhile, a farmer has to make up for the foreseeable crop losses by working on a significant area of land. Grace is seeking a loan of KES 10,000 that will enable her to buy seedlings and fertilizers to grow more crops in the coming season. She believes this loan will increase food security in her home.

She is based in Chuka. It is a remote town, with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married, and together with her husband has two lovely children. Her primary sources of income are milk, poultry, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Mary is a tough woman with tough skin, and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling.<br \/><br \/>The Chuka area has conditions that favor dairy farming. Mary has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow, but a lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow. The dairy cow she intends to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a breed that produces between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. With this cow Mary's farm will produce more milk, which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Chuka area is high, but the supply is low. So, through this loan Mary is going to reap more and comfortably meet the demand.<br \/><br \/>Her increased income will allow Mary to provide a secure future for her school-going children, by paying their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success. His vision is to keep even more dairy cows, so that she will be able to build a biogas digester, which would help her to save more energy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1736044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-20T01:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-04T01:20:08Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.71,"local_amount":8322.22,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":8613.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194726},{"amount":88.01,"local_amount":7652.63,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7920.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262533},{"amount":94.48,"local_amount":8216.03,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8503.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600843},{"amount":95.8,"local_amount":8549.53,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8848.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.52,"payment_id":681377700},{"amount":98.48,"local_amount":9115.03,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":9434.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.34,"payment_id":711505689},{"amount":90.42,"local_amount":8144.56,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8429.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.24,"payment_id":752110742}],"funded_date":"2014-11-20T22:06:03Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":794414,"name":"Reina Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reina de 41 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer emprendedora que desde hace 20 a\u00f1os se gana la vida elaborando prendas de vestir en su vivienda, adem\u00e1s hace remiendos para obtener mejores ingresos por la experiencia con la que cuenta, Reina cuenta con una gran cantidad de clientes que siempre buscan sus servicios.

For this reason, she is applying to FUSAI for a loan to invest in fabric, thread, needles, and zippers to make slipcovers, bedcovers, and pillowcases to sell and thus obtain more economic income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1727605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to invest in fabrics, thread, needles, and zippers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-11-20T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-04T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Esmeralda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.76,"local_amount":33.76,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T10:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":33.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579479155},{"amount":35.03,"local_amount":35.03,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":35.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595085580},{"amount":36.34,"local_amount":36.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T10:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611991439},{"amount":37.7,"local_amount":37.7,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-26T09:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":37.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626298689},{"amount":39.12,"local_amount":39.12,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":39.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636147527},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":40.58,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":40.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649502460},{"amount":42.1,"local_amount":42.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":42.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664984072},{"amount":43.68,"local_amount":43.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":43.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681278909},{"amount":45.32,"local_amount":45.32,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696488294},{"amount":146.37,"local_amount":146.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":146.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711397965}],"funded_date":"2014-11-20T18:30:36Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T12:36:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":799437,"name":"Algrace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Algrace is married with only one child.

She is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this business in 1977.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two cows and 15 sheep.  She also uses 1.2 hectare of allotted land on which she and her family grow barley.

and helps her in every way possible.  Character-wise, Gulina is calm, even-keeled and hardworking.  She has the equivalent of a high school education and has raised livestock for several years as her main source of income, which she also supplements with a pension.  She first started ten years ago, and thanks to her persistent efforts, currently has three cows, twelve sheep, six goats and two horses on her farm, while her monthly income is roughly 5,000 som.  All the same, this isn't nearly enough money to provide her and her family with a decent standard of living.  She wants to help her children and grandchildren, and as farming is her only major source of income, she's seeking a loan of 50,000 som from Bai Tushum Bank to add ten more sheep to her farm, and plans on using her extra income due to the loan to further expand her farm and bring in even more money for her family.

Meet Ireen, a hard-working, very honest and warm-hearted farmer who hails from the Chuka area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. \r\n\r\nIreen is the proud mother of two lovely children that she really loves and adores and always protects. Ireen\u2019s upbringing was very challenging and because of this she promised herself that she would work hard and get out of the poverty situation. That is why she started farming 10 years ago and through farming she has been able to earn a decent income.

Her regular customers are mostly her neighbors, relatives, and the local community. She has requested a loan to buy a new sewing machine and some packs of zippers and buttons to meet increasing demand. She is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC

This area is considered good for both crop and animal farming and because of the favorable weather, Donetah has been farming there for the past 5 years. \r\n\r\nThrough those years, she has made great strides. She is an enterprising woman who really wants to succeed in life. Being from Africa, a continent with so many challenges, she has to work extra hard. That is why she is seeking a loan of KES 62,400 to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Donetah will be able to sell milk to the nearby market and to her neighbors because there is an existing market. She wants to be economically empowered. Knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders support her dreams gives her confidence that her dreams will come true.

As the existing income is hardly enough for a family of three, Nunu decided to start a business for her family's welfare. She couldn\u2019t receive a loan from the local financial institutions because of their requirements to have business experience or enough income to be sufficient to cover the loan easily, until the Start Up program began.

Meet Agnes, a 39-year-old mother who is very hardworking, ambitious and self-motivated.

Agnes is married and has two beautiful children who she always refers to as \"her pride\u201d because they are a source of joy to her. That is why she is keen on letting them have a brighter future and a comfortable life. Agnes practices mixed farming - that is, crop and animal farming - and has been doing that for the past 10 years. She has all the farming techniques at her fingertips. Agnes's heart is in dairy farming, as she is passionate about dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows 'Mutune'. There is so much demand for milk in the Chuka area, but the supply is low. To meet the demand, Agnes plans to increase her milk production by buying a dairy cow. She is faced with financial challenges, but knowing that partners such as Juhudi Kilimo (via Kiva) are there, makes her feel relieved and she knows her dreams will be achieved. Agnes expressed that \u201cin five years, I want to make more money for myself and my family.\" With this loan, Agnes is well on her way to achieving this dream.

His main business is keeping dairy cows. He has 8 full grown cows and every day he takes the milk to his dairy cooperative to be processed into milk and yogurt which is sold all over Kenya. He is a successful business man with his dairy farm, but fuel is so expensive in Kenya that he can only buy a little bit of lpg (liquid petroleum gas) for cooking every month. His family still has to cook most of their foods with firewood and charcoal which causes lung problems and stings the eyes. And even though they use these cheaper fuels, they still spend more than KES 4,500 (USD 50) every single month just for cooking fuel! \n\nWhen Daniel was a child, he remembers playing in the trees. Now there are very few trees in his village for the children to play in since they are being cut down for firewood. Daniel's neighbor got a biogas system and Daniel saw how simple it was to use! You just fill it with cow dung and cook with the biogas like it is lpg, but cheap!! Please help Daniel to get a loan so that he can also have a biogas system. With the biogas system, his family will be healthy and his cows will be even more important since they will provide the family with clean cooking energy.\n\nDaniel is most proud of his family's good hospitality. When people come to visit them, they know they will be well fed. When his wife can cook over biogas the family can provide even better hospitality to their neighbors. Asante!

lives in a small village called Gatitu about two hours drive from Nairobi. She has a farm with her family where she keeps 3 dairy cows, 15 chickens and grows crops for the consumption of her family. Nearly everything she needs is right on her farm. She even has a borehole that she can collect clean drinking water from whenever she needs it. \n\nThe one thing she lacks is fuel for cooking. She spends KES 5,000 (USD 55) or more every month to buy cooking fuel for her family. She uses firewood, charcoal and sawdust for cooking. Firewood and charcoal take a long time to light and when they burn they fill her lungs with smoke and make her children cough. \n\nLucy learned about biogas from Takamoto Biogas at a presentation in her village, and many of her neighbors are already using biogas. She needs this loan to get a biogas system. With a biogas system she will only use the waste of her cows to produce energy and she will save money every month. Biogas is also important to Lucy because she is worried about the health of her children and biogas doesn't produce any smoke. Please help Lucy take care of her family by getting a biogas system.

Meet Daisy, a very hardworking, honest and ever-smiling mother of five lovely children that she really treasures. She is 43 years of age, and has been practicing farming for the past eight years. She is one of the hardworking women in her village, and she offers free advice to young farmers and extends extension services to other farmers in neighboring villages. \r\n\r\nDaisy's primary source of income is milk and egg selling, and through these, she has been able to earn an honest income. Daisy hails from the Litein area of Kenya, a place blessed with \u201cMother Nature\u201d, and good conditions that favor agricultural activities. Daisy is a very aspiring woman who wants to protect the future of her children and grandchildren. Hence, she is putting extra efforts into farming so that she can make ends meet. \r\n\r\nDaisy is seeking funds to build a greenhouse on her piece of land; with the greenhouse, her crops will have controlled environmental conditions that are ideal for crops to grow healthy. With the greenhouse, Daisy will increase her supply of tomatoes and she will be assured of more income. \r\n\r\nBeing a mother in Africa is very challenging, and accessing funds is so hard, but with institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Daisy is assured of realizing her dream. Daisy has undergone training on how to save the income generated from the greenhouse, and she is much disciplined with finances. \r\n\r\nShe is sure that through the loan, she will have permanent life change. Profits from the greenhouse will allow Daisy to improve her living conditions and assure her grandchildren of a good and secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":520.89,"image":{"id":1736200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-20T11:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-04T11:40:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.77,"local_amount":248.59,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":249.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600849},{"amount":53.5,"local_amount":4796.88,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4815.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459273},{"amount":277.37,"local_amount":25522.41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25620.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.3,"payment_id":681377706},{"amount":49.09,"local_amount":4685.56,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4703.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.17,"payment_id":711505694},{"amount":60.46,"local_amount":5651.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5673.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.58,"payment_id":731022496},{"amount":62.41,"local_amount":5795.82,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5818.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.24,"payment_id":752110747}],"funded_date":"2014-11-21T01:22:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":791148,"name":"Santos Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 utilizado para comprar pollo de engorde y gallinas ponedoras, ya que cuenta con las instalaciones necesarias para montar una granja av\u00edcola, tambi\u00e9n quiere mejorar las instalaciones de su granja de cerdos. \n\nLas proyecciones de santos son dar estudio a sus hijos, ya que uno quiere ser m\u00e9dico veterinario, comprar ganado lechero para vender leche y sus derivados y comprar el veh\u00edculo para trasladar el alimento de los animales.\n","en":"The loan will be used to buy broiler chickens and egg laying hens.

Meet Lucy, a 47-year-old, very hardworking, honest and ever smiling mother of 3 children. She lives with her husband in the Chuka area of Kenya - an area that is close to the famous Mount Kenya. Lucy passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past 20 years and has always managed to provide for her family. Her primary source of income has been crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. Lucy has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Lucy, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. Lucy said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Lucy hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1736211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-20T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-04T13:00:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.68,"local_amount":3348.9,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3390.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194732},{"amount":34.43,"local_amount":3060.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3098.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262539},{"amount":35.91,"local_amount":3192.06,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3231.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600850},{"amount":113.98,"local_amount":10398.82,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10528.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3,"payment_id":681377707}],"funded_date":"2014-11-20T20:47:19Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bela Vora","image":834828}},{"id":799596,"name":"Halluru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halluru is a maize farmer.

Meet Roda. She lives in the Litein area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills carpeted in manicured tea plantations. Leah is a mother of four children and she has been in the agriculture business for 16 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea. \r\n\r\nRoda has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Roda remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nRoda is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Roda will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits.

As a main source of income for her family, she raises livestock and grows farm produce, having launched this business 18 years ago with her own savings. Thanks to Gulsara\u2019s hard work, she now has one cow and 33 sheep on her farm. In addition, she has a land plot of 1.09 ha, where she grows wheat for own consumption and sale. Altogether her business brings in a revenue of 12,000 KGS per month. In order to develop her business further, Gulsara has turned to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 45,000 KGS to buy one cow.

This village is situated in a rural area which is around 150 kilometers away from the district headquarters. Cultivation is the main source of income of the people of this village. Apart from this a few families have small enterprises to earn some additional income for better livelihood. Hemalata is one of them. She is 33 years of age and hails from a Below Poverty Line family. The lady standing raising her hand in the photo is Hemalata. \r\n\r\nHemalata felt that the income from cultivation was not at all sufficient for managing her family, so for the last three years she has been running a general store in her house. Her husband helps in her business, for example doing the marketing from the nearest town. She sells general grocery items like sugar, lentils, biscuits, soap, shampoo, potatoes, onions, etc. \r\n\r\nHemalata was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. Her monthly income from the existing business is Rs.3000. From this income she barely manages her household expenses. Due to this lesser amount of income she is not able to construct a house for her family. So she wants to increase the stock of her business to earn some more income. \r\n\r\nThe present loan amount of Hemalata will be utilized to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently. She is also very much hopeful that this investment will help her to generate some additional income and she can plan for a bright future. Hemalata hopes to save enough for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested. She hopes to give better education to her children.\r\n\r\nThe other twelve members of the group are also doing small enterprises like general grocery shop, vegetable cultivation and vending, and cotton cultivation. They are very much happy to be associated with Kiva. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1736272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, shampoo, chocolate,  etc. for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KANDEI,BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-20T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-04T17:40:10Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aenie          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ahalya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belamati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chitri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemalata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanakadei ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Pani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premasila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunaphula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":168000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":168000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T00:49:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":798777,"name":"Ulither","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"With her first loan from Kiva, Ulither has been doing very well in her clothing business.

Living in Jakarta means high living costs for Rahmadi and his family. Therefore, to support his family\u2019s needs, Rahmadi decided to join Ruma 3 months ago. He is excited to do business as a Ruma agent, not only because he can raise his income by selling mobile phone airtime credits, but also because he can learn more about mobile technology use for businesses.\nAs the demand for mobile airtime increases (especially on the weekends), Rahmadi is applying for the working capital loan from Kiva in order to process more airtime transactions. In the near future, Rahmadi plans to add more products from Ruma to the things he sells, such as utility bill payment service and product catalog service to his community.

This is why she is requesting a loan from FUSAI to invest in galvanized sheet metal, wood, and nails to change the roof of her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1729026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to invest in galvanized sheet metal, wood, and nails to change the roof of her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-11-20T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-04T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina Haydee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":22.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":23.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":24.34},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":29.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":30.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.46},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":41.26,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":41.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595085586},{"amount":21.8,"local_amount":21.8,"processed_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T10:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":21.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611991447},{"amount":22.62,"local_amount":22.62,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-26T09:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":22.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626298702},{"amount":23.46,"local_amount":23.46,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":23.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636147534},{"amount":24.34,"local_amount":24.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":24.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649502465},{"amount":25.26,"local_amount":25.26,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664984077},{"amount":26.2,"local_amount":26.2,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":26.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681278913},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":27.19,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":27.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696488298},{"amount":87.87,"local_amount":87.87,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711397966}],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T23:10:23Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T12:36:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carlie Herron","image":1714606}},{"id":799682,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria is 47 years old and has two children.

She hails from a Schedule caste family. Schedule Caste people in India are considered to be the most backward. Around 95% of the people of this caste are socially and economically backward. To triumph over this situation steps are being taken by the government and NGOs in respect to education, empowerment, employment and livelihood. The young and confident lady standing with raised hand in the photo is Manju. She is a married lady of 27 years, having a son of 6 years. She resides with her husband and their son in a small mud house. \r\n\r\nManju has a small piece of land where she does vegetable cultivation.  She and her husband manage the vegetable cultivation farm. They produce vegetables like brinjal (eggplant), cauliflower, carrots, cabbages, chilli, cucumbers, papayas, ladies fingers (okra) etc. in the farm. Manju takes the vegetable produce of her farm to the daily market of the nearest town for selling. She earns a minimum of 400 INR per day and according to her, this is insufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family as well as the farm expenses. \r\n\r\nManju wants to expand her business by taking a loan. So she motivated eleven other women from her village and formed the Self Help Group, then contacted Mahashakti Foundation and took a loan of 168,000 INR. Manju has taken 16,000 INR from that and she will utilize the present loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs like seeds and pesticides for her farm. She expects a good return from her business by expanding her cultivation. Manju dreams of constructing a house and providing better education for her son. She hopes to give her family a bright future through her hard work.\r\n\r\nAmong the other eleven members of this group, ten members are doing vegetable and cotton cultivation and the other member is running a tent house. All of the members are very much hopeful to increase their income for better livelihood.

They see hope in the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge that combines small loans and education on a variety of practical subjects.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is a young, 23-year-old woman, named Juana, who married quite young. Juana has a textile business and creates typical blouses that are elaborately decorated. She employs three women. \r\n\r\nJuana is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she hopes will be funded by Kiva investors. She will use the funds to purchase a quantity of good-quality thread, as well as other supplies for the business. Juana realizes that this is the time of the year when demand increases due to the holidays, graduations, and other celebrations.\r\n\r\nHer three young children motivate her to work hard, so that they can have nutritious food on the table and attend school. One of her children is already in school and another is about to begin his education. Juana was able to attend elementary school and realizes the value of a good education. She is optimistic about the future. The women in the Trust Bank admire Juana because she knows how to read and write. She is inspirational to her friends in the Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank's Flor de Chuipol Group very much appreciates the opportunity to participate in the Microcredit Plus Program of Friendship Bridge. Through their kindness and generosity in funding these much needed loans, Kiva investors are valuable partners. Thank you!

Do\u00f1a Brenda rents a small location where she sells used clothing from the United States. In addition, for three years she has had a fruit business. She is requesting her first loan from KIVA. She will use the funds to expand her inventory of clothing and purchase more fruit.\r\n\r\nAs an adult, she was motivated to return to school and is about to receive her high school diploma. Do\u00f1a Brenda is very happy that her three teenage children are in school. She understands that a good education is key to success.\r\n\r\nEach of the fifteen women in the Aurora Trust Bank appreciate the assistance and generosity of Kiva investors.

Guatemala, has a cold and wet climate and beautiful landscapes. The villagers produce textiles on a grand scale. The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cDivine Maestro\u201d (Divine Teacher) is located here.\r\n\r\nLeticia is the Trust Bank secretary. She is 29 years old and has two beautiful children who are attending school. Leticia and her small family make sports attire, such as pants, shorts and sports shirts. In the spirit of bettering the quality and quantity of her merchandise production, she joined \u201cDivino Maestro\u201d. Now, she is about to begin her third loan cycle, which she will use to purchase quality fabric so she can continue with her production. Leticia is very excited at the prospect of acquiring new ideas, as well as knowledge, through the non-formal education program of Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe members of \u201cDivine Maestro\u201d, along with Leticia, are asking KIVA investors to finance a new line of credit which they will apply to making textiles. A majority of the funds will be used to purchase thread, needles, dyes and cloth. The ladies, without doubt, know that the ability to receive credit and education through Friendship Bridge has transformed the lives of the Maya women of Guatemala. They are extremely grateful for the non-formal education provided in many important subjects such as accounting, budgeting, customer service, health and hygiene, self-esteem and empowerment. The knowledge they receive has helped them find their own solutions to overcoming poverty. Thank you KIVA investors for making this possible!!!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2729.99,"image":{"id":1735244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

","en":"Sunatillo is 43 years old and plans to start a new business.  He's interested in buying and selling clothing items, particularly children's and adults' clothes.  At the moment, Sunatillo is not working anywhere; he is thoroughly focused on starting his new business.  With his savings, he has already purchased a retail outlet at the market and has put a business plan in place.  After calculating his costs, he has come to the conclusion that he is still lacking a small amount of money to bring merchandise for resale, and this is the reason why he has requested a loan.

He directly supervises and coordinates the activities of production and operating workers, such as inspectors, precision workers, machine setters and operators, assemblers, fabricators, and plant and system operators. \r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Charlie, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Charlie is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. He looks forward to your positive response, and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. He will use the loan to pay for his balances for their housing expense, and also to pay his other debt.\r\n\r\nCharlie hopes to give his children a good life. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1736816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for his housing expenses and other debt.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T03:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T03:10:08Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charlie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3370.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579535998},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3370.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134351},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3370.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757119},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3370.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200257},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3370.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186551},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3370.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535638}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T23:33:26Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":800031,"name":"Glory Stella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Glory Stella is 45 years old, married, and has one child who is in school.\r\n\r\nGlory Stella is in the agricultural business, pig fattening in the Philippines.
