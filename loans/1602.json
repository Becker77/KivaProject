She is from Cavite, Philippines and she has two children. She is one of the beneficiaries of the employment program of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nMarivic works as a production line leader. She conducts inspections and tests per control plan, work instruction and procedures. She maintains good housekeeping at all time at the respective working area. She is also responsible for the group of operators and carries out manpower utilization effectively to meet shipment.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Marivic is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Marivic is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward for your positive response and any help from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan as a starting capital for her canteen business.\r\n\r\nMarivic wants to have a stable source of income so she could meet their daily needs and expense. She wants to give her children a better life and future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

The couple works hard to support their daily needs and to send their kids to school.\r\n\r\nYolanda caters to party needs and also has video\/karaoke and DVD rental.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Aside from those businesses, she also has a vulcanizing business, which her husband operates. She earns a minimum of 1,500 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP, which she will use to pay for party supplies such as souvenirs, tables, balloons, and maintenance of her video\/karaoke machine. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nYolanda dreams of growing her business so she can send her children to the best schools. She wants to lead a happy and quiet life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She will also use part of the loan to buy fabrics and thread for her doormat-making business, which is shown in her photo. She knows that more items on hand will result in more sales and thus increase her earnings. Her earnings from her store are a stable source of income to sustain her family's basic needs and to educate her children. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her. \r\n\r\nEstrella Marie dreams of expanding her business with other products to sell to increase her income. She aims to give her children the best education to have a better future. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She wants to purchase flour (white and whole wheat) in bulk, as end of the year sales generally creates a food shortage, which means she loses sales and clients.  This is the 5th loan sequence with this institution in 10 years which does this activity.  It is for this reason that Emiliana is requesting a loan, to buy flour in bulk to not lose sales or clients due to end of year sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":1729890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour in bulk to not lose sales or clients due to end of year sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":4450,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Claudia Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emeliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosse Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arminda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhanet Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oscar Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4911.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4834.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4972.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5113.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5259.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5408.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":716.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":705.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":746.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":767.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":789.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":716.63,"local_amount":4911.71,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4917.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556653},{"amount":705.36,"local_amount":4834.48,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157349},{"amount":725.44,"local_amount":4972.09,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4977.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554248},{"amount":746.09,"local_amount":5113.64,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5119.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226788},{"amount":1556.48,"local_amount":10668.08,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10680.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213966}],"funded_date":"2014-11-21T22:54:24Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Josee Perron","image":null}},{"id":795063,"name":"Grecia Antonella","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grecia Antonella tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente, tiene un hijo, vive con su familia en una zona rural del distrito de Oyot\u00fan, provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, costa norte de Per\u00fa.

She is 48  and she is a resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Jobico and has six children; one is in High School, two are in the Elementary Level and three are already working. She manages her own household while operating a business. She works hard to provide income for their daily household needs and for the schooling of her children. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is in the direct selling business. She sells natural organic juice named Jinga juice which is a fusion of two super foods, guyabano (soursop) and wheat grass juice. Filipinos are now more knowledgeable and health conscious. They are learning to take natural juice instead of soda to support their well-being for the love of their family. Her regular customers are her neighbors, friends, family and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help sustain her business, she is requesting an PHP 8,000 loan which she will use to buy natural Jinga juice to meet orders from customers which are her neighbors, relatives, friends and the local community. Aside from her direct selling she also makes bed sheets to fill the orders of friends and neighbors. Part of the loan will be used to buy fabric needed in her sewing of bed sheets. She thanks God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given to her. It will surely help meet her family's everyday needs and for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nElizabeth aims to grow her business so she can send her children to the best school. She prays they stay strong and healthy and that they always lead a quiet life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1736125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for Jinga juice to sell to customers and fabric for making bedsheets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.02,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536002},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134355},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2396.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757123},{"amount":39.99,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200261},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1198.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186555}],"funded_date":"2014-11-21T14:01:27Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jonathan Hiebert","image":852394}},{"id":800102,"name":"Peluce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peluce is 50 years old, and married with nine children.

From the time she was a young girl, she had always dreamed of becoming a leader in her community.  Berenice learned about the loans offered by FODEMI and formed a group of 10 people who have ideas for businesses that would benefit their town.  They approached FODEMI in order to apply for a loan so that they could begin working on their business ideas.  <br \/><br \/>Berenice has two children who attend school in the community, so she hopes to help them throughout their entire academic development.  She has a small retail business where she sells natural products and natural medicines with restorative properties.  Berenice wants to expand this service since it is doing well in the local market.  <br \/><br \/>In her free time, Berenice pans for gold in the community river so that she can provide additional financial support toward the household expenses.  Her husband does not have a stable job, but he cultivates a small plot of land.  He produces bananas for family consumption.  Berenice wants to grow her business because she needs to support her children as they are growing.  She wants them to continue so that they can attend a university in San Lorenzo or Ibarra.  <br \/><br \/>With this loan, she will buy more natural products and save for her loan payments and educational expenses.  This is her first loan and she is very grateful for this opportunity to become the manager of her own

She and her husband do all things relating to farming. After harvesting, she sells her products to the wholesaler, and from the earnings, manages her family. But as she possesses a big family of six members and income is hand to mouth, she wants to expand her cultivation and wishes to use the field year-round. \r\n\r\nTherefore, she has planned to utilize her present loan of 12,000 INR for purchasing seeds, fertilizer, manure, pesticides and a small motor pump for the lifting of water from her dug well.

She counts the number of pattern parts, layers of cloth prior to cutting, number of stitches per inch during sewing operations and collects other measurement knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Arlene, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Arlene is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nArlene dreams of becoming a supervisor. She dreams for her children to be able to complete their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1736922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the tuition fees of her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536004},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134357},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757125},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200263},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186557},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535640}],"funded_date":"2014-11-21T19:33:16Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":800125,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James sells household goods in Kisumu town and has been running this business for 5 years now.

She is requesting a loan so that she can start a cybercaf\u00e9.  <br \/><br \/>At a very young age, Don Le\u00f3n worked with his father by selling hair accessories and costume jewelry.  They also bought and sold dishes for 20 years.  At first, he needed a partner in order to gain the necessary experience but then he ventured alone so that he could start his own business.  In order to obtain the best prices, Le\u00f3n would travel to another country to buy dishware such as spoons, plates, glasses, and place settings.  Since the Christmas season is approaching, which happens to be a good time for making sales, he needs a loan in order to stock up on merchandise.  <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Victoria has always wanted to have her own business, so she began selling sweets, fried foods, and Mexican snacks.  She will invest her loan in this business.  The family is very pleased with the loan because it will help them overcome their main difficulty, which is the lack of investment capital.  As a result, they can obtain the necessary products in order to grow their businesses.  <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken at Do\u00f1a Victoria\u2019s business, but some of Don Le\u00f3n\u2019s products can also be seen."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6850,"image":{"id":1723567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

The land without the labor of farmers devoted to the cultivation of corn would not provide the crops that sustain every generation. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to buy 45 quintals of corn (a quintal is about 100 lb), as well as chemical fertilizer, so that his corn crop will be of the best this year and so that he can obtain more corn to sell in the area surrounding his community and in the market. His goal is to pay off his debts, and in the future buy more land for growing more corn and for providing an education for his children so that they can be fine professionals someday.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1728464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Jeffrey, her partner, is a landscaper and they have one child.  Julieta has been employed to a garment factory in Cavite for almost six years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*. Julieta is a production worker. She helps in garment making processes, from cutting to sewing, pressing, packing, tagging and shipping.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Julieta, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. For this reason, Julieta is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem returning it back since the loan payments area being deducted every pay day.  She looks forward for your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to buy personal needs,  particularly her child's needs like milk, vitamins and medicine. She will also use the loan to pay some of her debt.\r\n\r\nJulieta wants to have a stable source of income, it is just that she has no capital yet to start her own business. She meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1736958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"pay for personal necessities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":916.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":1833.34,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1872.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536005},{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":1833.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1872.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134358},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":1833.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1872.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757126},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":1833.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1872.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200264},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":1833.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1872.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186558},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":1833.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1872.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535641}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T05:03:34Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":800155,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is 41 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nJocelyn works hard to provide for her family.

agricultural institute, but she is an accomplished farmer from the Nandihills area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. She is happily married and together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with 4 children. For the past 15 years she has been involved in mixed farming and because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. \r\n\r\nRose has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up, so Rose, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nRose said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Rose hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going

He is single and 25 years old, and is requesting another loan in order to continue growing potatoes. He has been doing this work for a while, in order to benefit his family and his community.

Kenya. She has spent the past five years of her life farming. She sells milk, poultry, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nBaskallia is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, dairy farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk her cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutritional value. She is so keen and close to her cows that she has given them names. \r\n\r\nDairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Baskallia wants to take full advantage of her opportunities, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital. That is why she is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. Baskallia has planted Napier grass, so feeding the cows will never be a challenge. She also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once she acquires the additional dairy cow. The cow she will buy will produce between 10 and 15 litres of milk per day, which will translate to more income and profits. The profits from milk selling will allow Baskallia to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products, such as cream, yoghurt, and cheese. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that she will be able to start a biogas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs.\r\n\r\nWith your loan, all that Baskallia dreams of is a secure future for her children. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1736986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an exotic, high-quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T18:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T18:50:14Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baskallia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25875,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1831.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1884.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1939.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1996.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2054.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2114.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2176.76},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2240.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2305.85},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2442.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2513.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.31,"local_amount":2096.69,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2187.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194740},{"amount":4.74,"local_amount":409.03,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":426.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262550},{"amount":270.95,"local_amount":23369.28,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":24385.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264604}],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T22:29:12Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":796138,"name":"Baraka Office Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Nyasisi est commer\u00e7ante, membre d\u2019un collectif  d\u2019affaires \u00abBaraka Office\u00bb, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 58 ans, mari\u00e9e, m\u00e8re de 4 enfants tous \u00e9tudient.

which has good weather that favors crop and animal farming. She is a single mother who has two beautiful children. Eunice has been actively involved in mixed farming for the past six years and sells milk, eggs and various varieties of food crops at a local market and to her neighbors. She passionately loves poultry farming. The biggest challenge she is currently facing is the lack of breeds of poultry that are disease resistant and grow well. To solve this problem she is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to buy additional poultry that will grow well. Having additional poultry will provide her with practical benefits since she will be able to increase her egg production and also sell good-quality poultry meat. Through this loan, she will increase her profit margins and bring better living conditions to her family. Eunice believes that proper feeding of her poultry with high-quality feed will allow it to grow even better. Other than profits from poultry, she will benefit from chicken manure, which contains higher amounts of nitrogen than other forms of livestock manure. Eunice is comfortable with the repayment period and monthly installments and promises to make payments throughout the repayment cycle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1737012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy better breeds of chicken for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T19:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T19:10:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.18,"local_amount":3571.37,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3616.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194741},{"amount":31.03,"local_amount":2757.93,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2792.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824153},{"amount":32.08,"local_amount":2851.97,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2887.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262551},{"amount":35.21,"local_amount":3129.35,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3168.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264605},{"amount":36.81,"local_amount":3271.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3312.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600859},{"amount":219.28,"local_amount":19491.24,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":19735.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459282},{"amount":53.49,"local_amount":4926.44,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":752110755}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T09:02:49Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":795111,"name":"Leonidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonidas es un grupo solidario integrado por tres socios esforzados, es coordinado por F\u00e1tima una mujer emprendedora de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, acompa\u00f1ada, dedicada a la comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras en su domicilio, este negocio lo impulso hace tres a\u00f1os, por medio de un pr\u00e9stamo que le hizo a su hermana, este cr\u00e9dito lo solicita para la compra de pl\u00e1tano, tomate, chiltoma, zanahoria, chayote, yuca, e impulsar la venta de l\u00e1cteos como es queso, crema y la venta de carne de pollo.

He already has one child and is married to Cherry Lou, who is also a factory worker. They are both beneficiaries of the employment services under the supervision of the Center for Community Transformation Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nIn the garment factory, Wilmar works as a Clothing Presser. He both under-presses fabrics during their production and presses garments in a garment-finishing department during their final stages of production.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Wilmar is the improper balance of salaries and family expenses. As as result, there is little access to either savings or credit. This situation can make such employees heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. For this reason, Wilmar is asking for your assistance in preventing him from exposure to loan sharks. \r\n\r\nWilmar has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative which he had no problem repaying, since the loan payments were deducted with each payday. He looks forward to your positive response, as any amount will surely be of great help. Wilmar plans to use the loan to pay the balance he owes for his motorcycle.\r\n\r\nWilmar dreams of one day becoming a successful and wealthy businessman. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1737001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay the balance owed for his motorcyle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T19:40:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilmar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536006},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134359},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757127},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200265},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186559},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535642}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T06:52:46Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":800233,"name":"Risper","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello lenders, meet Risper a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman who hails from Nandihills area of Kenya, an area that is near the famous Rift valley. She is 27 years of age and has been farming for the past 8 years.  Through those years, she has gathered so much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small businesses that she does so that she can make ends meet. Risper is very passionate about farming and she loves cultivating her farm. That is why every day she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. \r\n\r\nAlthough Risper makes profits through farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income through the selling of cereals. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy cereals. The Nandihills area is one of the regions that is populated and has a high demand for cereals. That means that Risper will make more profits and be able to satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Risper, but she feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Risper believes that this loan will be of much help and she will be able to satisfy the demand that is there for cereals and she believes that the extra income will allow permanent change to her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Risper to repay back the loan and secure the future of her school going

Meet Julia, 31 years of age, a very hardworking, progressive and honest farmer from a very remote village in Mosombor in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. This area is very fertile with favorable weather patterns that support farming activities. Julia is happily married and the proud mother of 3 children, and together they live on a small piece of land that she really treasures. Her primary sources of income are eggs, milk and a variety of food crops that she grows on her farm. She also works in transportation and does some small business transactions in order to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nAlthough this humble and industrious mother makes a profit, she faces the challenge of not being able to produce enough to meet the ready market that is available. Therefore she is seeking funds from Kiva lenders to buy farm implements like good fertilizer and good quality seeds. Through this loan she will double her production and this will translate into increased income. She then intends to save more money in the future so that she can develop her farming. This loan will help Julia to realize her dream of getting out of poverty, and she will be able to secure her family's

She is married and has a child. She has been employed in a garment factory in Cavite for two years, through the help of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Covenant Community Service Cooperative.*\r\n\r\nMary Jane works as a sewer. She does the sewing and designing of clothing apparel according to the company's or clients' demands. She sews clothes using a sewing machine or other stitching machines and often does hand-stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Mary Jane, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Mary Jane is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in paying them back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.  She looks forward to your positive response and any upcoming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for their housing expense.\r\n\r\nMary Jane hopes to give her children a good and quality education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills and quality jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring, and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, empowering the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1737144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for her housing expense.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-21T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-05T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536008},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134361},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757129},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200267},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186561},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535644},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665016930}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T06:52:36Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":800325,"name":"Raineria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raineria is 44 years old and has five children.

He drives the company vehicle during their shipping schedule over a designated route and ensures the safety and timely delivery of the factory\u2019s output. \r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Roy is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Roy is asking for your assistance to prevent him from being exposed to any loan sharks. He has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and he had no problem in repaying it since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.  He looks forward for your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. He will use the loan to pay for the educational expenses of his children.\r\n\r\nRoy wants his children to complete their studies. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line

She counts the number of pattern parts, layers of cloth prior to cutting, stitches per inch during sewing operations, and collects other measurement knowledge.<br \/><br \/>One of the main dilemmas of employees, like Gemma, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. Also they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders. Money lenders capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards, as loan collateral. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, Gemma is asking for your assistance -- to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in returning it back since the loan payment is deducted every payday. She looks forward to your positive response, and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay the school fees of her child who is a college student.<br \/><br \/>Gemma wants her children to finish their schooling. She meets up with her co-fellowship members** every week, to share stories of her work. <br \/><br \/><br \/>*The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force, trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

Its core programs are the following:  Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>**CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers, before they start their daily work routine.

Her partner is Marcelo, and they have two children. She has been employed at a garment factory in Cavite for almost two years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nImelda is a clothing presser. She presses fabrics or garments during the production process (known as under-pressing) as well in the final stages of production (usually in a garment-finishing department). Sometimes, she helps in the sewing process and other production processes if necessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Imelda is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses; they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Imelda is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in paying them back, since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. She looks forward to your positive response, and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan for the payment of formal documentation of their land rights.\r\n\r\nImelda wants to operate her own business in the future. She hopes to give her children the best education possible. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, to cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1737100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for formal documentation of land rights.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-22T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-06T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536007},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134360},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757128},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200266},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186560},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535643}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T08:26:49Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":800319,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is 54 years old and married with six children.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

A pesar de las dificultades econ\u00f3micas que tuvieron, Geraldine logr\u00f3 terminar su carrera profesional en Qu\u00edmica en la Universidad del Valle, obteniendo el t\u00edtulo profesional en Junio del 2013. \nEl principal objetivo que tiene Geraldine, es poder realizar un doctorado en Cristalograf\u00eda en una universidad en el exterior, y para lograrlo necesita solicitar el apoyo de Kiva, puesto que es la \u00fanica forma para poder cubrir los gastos de ex\u00e1menes de idioma y aplicaci\u00f3n a las universidades. Una vez realice su maestr\u00eda y regrese a Colombia, Geraldine anhela poder trabajar como docente de universidad y poder trabajar este tema que es tan poco com\u00fan en el pa\u00eds y seguir aportando a la investigaci\u00f3n y a la generaci\u00f3n de conocimiento desde la universidad. \nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia: \nLa investigaci\u00f3n en ciencias b\u00e1sicas y el desarrollo tecnol\u00f3gico es una de las principales estrategias que un pa\u00eds debe implementar en orden de superar sus  \u00edndices de pobreza y violencia.

Ahora que deseo aplicar a un postgrado deseo enfocarme en cristalograf\u00eda de prote\u00ednas la cual es una t\u00e9cnica anal\u00edtica que permite dar a conocer la estructura qu\u00edmica y f\u00edsica de las prote\u00ednas. La importancia de esta t\u00e9cnica radica en que es vital conocer la prote\u00ednas estructuralmente con el objetivo de entender su funcionamiento y a si prevenir o curar diferentes enfermedades.

She is the oldest daughter of her family. Her younger brother just finished his professional program. Her mother is a housewife, and her father works as an industrial mechanic. In spite of the economic difficulties that they had, Geraldine managed to finish her professional program in chemistry at the University of Valle, obtaining her professional degree in June of 2013. \r\n\r\nGeraldine's principal goal is to be able to complete a doctoral degree in crystallography at a foreign university, and to achieve this, she needs to apply for support from Kiva, since this is the only way she will be able to cover the expenses of the language exams and applications to the universities. Once she completes her training and returns to Colombia, Geraldine dreams of being able to work as a teacher at a university and being able to work in this area, which is so uncommon in the country, and continue supporting research and the generation of knowledge at the university.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nResearch in basic sciences and technological development is one of the principal strategies that a country needs to implement in order to improve its indices of poverty and violence. Our country is now making a great effort to overcome these difficulties. Nevertheless, the quality of research is not comparable with that developed in the countries of the first world, due to different economic factors. My goal as a professional Colombian woman is to complete my post-doctoral education in the United States, since this country has the most advanced technology in the field in which I want to specialize, which is the crystallography of proteins.\r\n\r\nSince my undergraduate education, I have had the opportunity to work in crystallography, thanks to various agreements that my tutor has with different universities in Brazil and England and that allowed us assess the samples that we were synthesizing in the laboratory. Now that I want to apply for a graduate program, I want to focus on the crystallography of proteins, which is an analytical technique that allows the chemical and physical structure of the proteins to be known. The importance of this technique is rooted in the fact that it is vital to know proteins structurally with the goal of understanding their function and thus how they prevent or cure different diseases. Unfortunately, this technique is not implemented in Colombia due to the fact that the country doesn't have X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction, which are the tools that allow the measurements to be taken.\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that a graduate degree abroad will allow me to acquire professional and personal maturity, this education will offer me the opportunity to live in a culture different from my own and to share with colleagues from different parts of the globe. To complete a master's in one of the best universities of the world is an unforgettable experience, and it will give me the necessary credentials to obtain an academic job in the research field in my country, where I will be able to have the tools and the knowledge necessary to drive research in basic sciences and especially to expand crystallographic study here in Colombia.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan plays an important role in the process of applying to different universities, since at this time I don't have the solvency to cover all the economic costs that a process of this importance requires. And since all the universities have a specific deadline, I need to begin to prepare the applications starting now, so that the dates don't pass and make me postpone my training for one more year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1730053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"To apply for a doctoral program in crystallography","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2014-11-22T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-06T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geraldine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1083,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":90.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":1083,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650529950}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T11:10:31Z","paid_date":"2015-05-21T12:15:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":800392,"name":"Javed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Javed is a 37-year-old man residing in Lalamusa, Gujrat, Pakistan.

She is married and has an 11-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. Her business is selling fruit. She is entrepreneurial, persistent, independent, responsible, and hard-working. She carries out her business in the area of Sacaba, which is known for being a rural area and the producer of fruits such as kiwi, pears, dogwood, figs, bananas, and oranges, among others. It is located in a semi-tropical valley with a warm climate all year.\r\n\r\nNieves has a dark complexion, long, braided black hair, and short stature. She dresses in traditional form (hat, blanket, and skirt). Her maternal tongue is Quechua, and she speaks Spanish. (In the photo, she is the first one on the right, in a green blouse and a light blue apron.) She lives with her husband, who works in construction, and her children, who are in school. The family lives in a house of brick which has potable water and electricity. Her desires to improve herself led her to form a bank with people with businesses such as selling seasonal clothing, machine knitting, technical service for equipment, selling furniture, selling quilts, making leather purses, and selling meat pies so that they could apply for a loan and improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling fruit produced in that area. She has a regular sales stand where she receives store owners to sell them fruit wholesale. Her business is prosperous because her customers are regular and they increase at the end of the year, improving her sales.

Meet Ann, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 30-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of her family with two children, she farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nandi Hills, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, she has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, egg and tea selling. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. Ann passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter and another quality breed of dairy cow. The chaff cutter will assist Ann in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to feed her cow. Also, it will aid the animal\u2019s digestion and prevent the animals from rejecting any part of their food. Ann also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-25 litres of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 Kenya shillings per liter and, through this loan, she will be making a cool US $11 per day. \r\n\r\nBefore Ann joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, she considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have future promise for income generation. After training, Ann now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the millionaires club. With the loan, Ann will increase her income from milk selling and her cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and, through this loan, Ann will achieve this. An increase in income will allow Ann to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Ann fears that her dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide its reliable market channel, credit facility and services that she requires to grow her dairy enterprise."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":413.39,"image":{"id":1737280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Her youngest daughter is a university student. Atymbu has a high school education and started working in animal husbandry and agriculture in 1990 with the purchase of 10 sheep. Thanks to her hard work and persistent effort, she developed her business and currently has two steers and three cows as well as a 0.3 hectare piece of land where she grows corn for her own use. Her monthly revenue is 7,000 KGS; however, this amount of income is far from enough to cover her family's living expenses, let along to pay for her daughter's education.\r\n\r\nTherefore, with the goal of further developing her business, Atymbu has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 KGS to purchase sheep. She plans to put profits from the loan into further increasing her head count of livestock as well as increasing her family's income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1735953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase additional sheep in order to increase her family's income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul town, Jalalabad region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-11-22T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-06T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atymbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40320.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995626}],"funded_date":"2014-12-01T19:33:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":800487,"name":"Serah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Serah is a married woman.

Meet Margaret, an ever-smiling, hardworking, and honest mother who is 37 years of age. She hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, which is home to the best long distance athletes in the world. She is a proud mother of school-going children that she really values and treasures, and she will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. \r\n\r\nMargaret's primary source of income has been selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming; through these ventures she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been practicing farming for ten years, and through those years she has never regretted venturing into farming. \r\n\r\nMargaret sells her products to the nearby market; that is vegetables, eggs, and milk. She has a challenge of timely delivery of the products and also meeting the demand that exists. She is always forced to walk for long distances to reach the market, and this really affects her. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Through the loan she will be able to deliver her products faster, and because her products are perishable, they require quick delivery and the motorbike will offer that. \r\n\r\nMargaret's dream is to get out of the poverty level, and she is sure that through this loan she will be able to realize her dream. She would like to empower others economically, and she plans to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farming activities. Through this she will improve her living standards.

Nuapada district in Odisha, India. The main objective was to earn some income of their own and be self sufficient through a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nSumitra is one of the members of this group and is standing in the middle with a raised hand in the standing row of the photograph. She is a very energetic and hardworking lady of 50 years of age and lives with her husband, one son who is a driver, and one daughter who is studying in 10th standard. Sumitra has already completed the marriage of her four elder daughters.\r\n\r\nSumitra is running a pickle and papad business with her own initiative for the last 10 years. She herself makes mango and lemon pickles of different types and papad of different sizes and qualities. She supplies the pickles and papad to the retailers of Khariar town and vendors of nearby villages. \r\n\r\nSumitra brings the raw materials from the nearest wholesale market, 200 kms away. Her daughter helps her in the preparation of pickles. She herself contacts different traders and customers to make her business more widespread.\r\n\r\nSumitra earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her existing business. Sumitra says that from the present income, she is managing her household, but it is very difficult to think of the marriage of her son and daughter from this scanty income. So, she wants to increase the volume of her business for earning some extra income for the future. \r\n\r\nFrom the present loan amount, Sumitra wants to purchase bulk mango, oil, spices and ascent for pickle preparation, and black gram and black pepper for papad preparation. This will help her to decrease the transporting and raw material cost, as she brings it frequently. She can also manufacture the products for a longer period.  \r\n\r\nSumitra hope to reconstruct her house, as the present one is old, and do the marriages of her son and daughter in a respectable manner. \r\n\r\nThe other 10 members of the group are doing small businesses like milk selling, tiffin (light meal) center, fast food center, broom selling, etc.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1737233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing mangoes, oil, spices and ascent for pickle preparation and black gram and black pepper for papad preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-22T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-06T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Butaki       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dlimba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemakanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rinki ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satapathi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Snehalata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":172000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":172000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T06:51:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":800517,"name":"Sala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sala is a determined student nurse in her final year in one of the country\u2019s private universities.
