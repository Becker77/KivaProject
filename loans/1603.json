She lives with her husband, son, parents-in-law, grandmother-in-law and brother-in-law. Ani's husband works for the private sector, and her grandmother-in-law receives a retirement pension. However, their salaries are not enough to meet the needs of the family. \r\n\r\nAni is engaged in cattle breeding, in aviculture, and in the cultivation of wheat, barley, potatoes, cucumbers, carrots and greens. Her family helps her in selling the agricultural produce in the local market. All the family work hard to earn a living. \r\n\r\nThe requested loan of USD 2500 will be a huge help to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling them to  purchase wheat seeds (700 kgs), cover cultivation costs,  and buy forage for feeding the livestock. \r\n\r\nSince this is Ani's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before because they have no credit history. \r\n\r\nAni and her family rely on the good will of the lenders. They will be grateful to them for their support in collecting the needed loan to run their agricultural business in a more efficient way."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1180.97,"image":{"id":1737386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Meet Josphina, 47 years of age and a proud mother of four. She is very ambitious and enterprising, and a go-getting woman who hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya. She has been doing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income are egg selling, crop selling, and some personal business that she does to make ends meet. Josphina loves farming, taking really good care of her dairy cows and even nicknaming her cow. \r\n\r\nThe Kapsowar area has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming: good soil, good climate, a good transport system and a ready market for horticulture products. Josphina wants to take advantage and start horticultural farming. She is seeking a loan to get her started and, through improved income, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure her children's futures. The financial benefits that Josphina will reap are almost immediate; hence, she will be assured of a secure future. She plans to start exporting her horticulture to international markets once she has accumulated more profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1737384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-22T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-06T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.98,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josphina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.15,"local_amount":2988.56,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3073.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194752},{"amount":61.55,"local_amount":5385.95,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5539.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824173},{"amount":31.11,"local_amount":2721.87,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2799.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264614},{"amount":32.81,"local_amount":2871.28,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2953.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600869},{"amount":31.8,"local_amount":2782.88,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2862.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459291},{"amount":33.63,"local_amount":3020,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3106.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":681377726},{"amount":33.78,"local_amount":3054.92,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3142.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.13,"payment_id":696587387},{"amount":33.51,"local_amount":3120.47,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3209.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.15,"payment_id":711505714},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":3261.86,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3355.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"payment_id":731022512},{"amount":63.93,"local_amount":5792.21,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5957.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":752110764}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T22:58:14Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":800536,"name":"Abdulrazak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdulrazak is a maize farmer.

thinking about most Kenyans that agriculture is for the older generation. She is the mother of three children and has been doing farming for the last ten years so that she can supplement her income from the small business she does. \r\n\r\nSelly does crop farming and cattle keeping and she enjoys farming a lot. Her biggest challenges are the lack of finances to improve her farming and diseases. This has made her seek a loan of KES 20,000 to purchase sheep. Her projections are that by the end of the year these sheep will have given birth to at least four other sheep. \r\n\r\nThrough sheep-keeping, she will be able to get sheep wool, which is very expensive and fetches more profits. This translates to more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also, she will be able to sell sheep meat and sheepskin, which will increase her income level. The profits will be used to repay the loan on time and grow the business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":210.91,"image":{"id":1737425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-22T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-06T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.9,"local_amount":1590.85,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1610.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194754},{"amount":17.05,"local_amount":1515.79,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1534.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824181},{"amount":17.32,"local_amount":1539.21,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1558.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262564},{"amount":17.62,"local_amount":1566.23,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1585.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264618},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":1543.32,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1562.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600872},{"amount":41.24,"local_amount":3666.01,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3711.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459294},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":3542.37,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3586.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.28,"payment_id":696587390},{"amount":40.83,"local_amount":3784.19,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3831.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.74,"payment_id":731022514}],"funded_date":"2014-11-22T19:36:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":800561,"name":"Tereza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tereza lives with her mother in Zuygaghbyur village, Shirak region.

Steps are being taken by the government and NGOs in respect to education, empowerment, employment and livelihood to triumph over this situation. \r\n\r\nThe young and confident lady standing with a raised hand in the photo is Himadri. She is a married lady of 27 years having two daughters who are seven and three years old. She resides with her husband and two daughters in a small house. \r\n\r\nHimadri has been running a paddy milling unit in her village for the last last five years. Her husband manages this unit. Villagers from the nearby 10-15 villages come to her mill to mill their paddy rice. As there are no other rice hullers in the nearby area, the number of customers is increasing regularly. Therefore Himadri is planning to increase her income by expanding the business. \r\n\r\nSo she along with other thirteen women formed a Self Help group named Maa Saraswati and took a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Looking into the demand of the locality, from her present loan she wants to purchase another rice huller. She is certain that this will generate a handsome of income for her. \r\n\r\nHimadri hopes to save enough money to build a permanent house for her paddy milling unit, construct a good house for her family and give better education to her children. The other members of the group are doing different types of business like vegetable vending, fish vending, fabrication unit, cycle repairing center, barber shop, animal trading etc."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1737528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase another rice huller.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"SARGADI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-22T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-06T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":124,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilashadei ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bisaya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrakanti  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Golapi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gomani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Himadri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lakshmi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabitri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":208000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":208000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T11:16:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":800648,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luis is a jewelry artisan from Peru who specializes in handcrafted silver pieces.

She has three dependent children who are currently in school. To make a living and support her family, she manages and operates a rice farming business in a small farmland which is located near her house. She has been a farmer for more than ten years. On average, she is able to make an earning of USD 5.00 per day.\r\n\r\nSattra wants to have household energy at a reduced monthly cost by purchasing a solar energy home system.

Through the earnings she is able to send her children to school and meet their daily living expense. \r\n\r\nShe would now like to apply for a 10,000 PHP loan which she will use for the continuous maintenance of her tricycle unit. It is important that her tricycle is always in a good running condition to ensure efficient service and thus steady income. She also sells snacks as additional income. Her tricycle earnings are a stable source to sustain her family's basic needs and for the education of her children. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\nHermenia dreams of having another tricycle unit and a food stall of her own. She aims to give her children the best education possible for them to have a better future.

Therefore Gulshan has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Gulshan's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily.

is age 28.  She is a mother of three children and lives in Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband has been running a general store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store, as well his relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with an even tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town, and that is the reason his business runs well. Due to good relations his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Khalida requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc.  Khalida hopes that her husband will utilize the loan in a positive way.

Almeda has been a member of Paglaum for four years, with several loans, and she has repaid on time.  Now, Almeda is applying for the amount of 30,000PHP.  One half of the available loan will be used as down payment on a secondhand motorcycle for egg delivery.  The other half amount will be used as starting capital of the salted egg business. Almeda is very happy because of the financial literacy that Paglaum offers to the members.  It is very useful to her in handling and budgeting the income they have to sustain the education of her children.

She is married and has three children.  She lives in La Esperanza, Sibutad.  Geronima has busied herself in pig raising for seven years and earns a living for the family.  Her husband is a tenant of a coconut land, and because of their sincerity and honesty in the remittance of the income from that land, the owner offered to sell the said land on an installment basis.  Geronima is very happy to grab the opportunity, and asked the assistance of Paglaum Cooperatives.

Ricky personally manages the delivery of his flowers, and at the same time, takes good care of his piglets after delivery. \r\n\r\nRicky is very thankful of the opportunity that Paglaum has given to him and hopes that he can offer a job to his neighbour in the near future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1736975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to improve the pig fence and to buy additional piglets and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calamba, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricky","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-19T11:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10113.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595783909},{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10113.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610686615},{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T11:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10113.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624952004},{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10113.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636437938},{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10113.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649706163}],"funded_date":"2014-11-23T14:41:12Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T15:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":797951,"name":"Mariama","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Revendeuse de pure water dans un boutique depuis 1989, Mariama d\u00e9sire un second cr\u00e9dit pour acheter des marchandises.

This new loan will go to additional supplies for doormat-making like fabric, cloth, thread, needles and other materials, which will increase her profit. An increase in profit will also result in her business becoming viable and sustainable.

This new loan will pay for more scrap and recyclable materials which she needs to increase her profit from the business. An increase in profit will also result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she will be able to meet the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nAside from growing her business, Raquel aims to give her children the best education, which currently they don't have.

She meets every week with her *co-fellowship members to share stories of her work and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mary\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 4.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 9 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T12:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T12:20:09Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwanaidi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":85200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-23T17:00:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":801028,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is 48 years old and married with six children, three of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nShe works hard to provide for her family.

Sadly, because of a lack of economic resources and because she had to start working at a very young age, Gulnara was unable to study a professional career.  She works hard growing maize on family-owned agricultural land, and she sells it locally. She always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. Gulnara is also involved in dairy farming, taking care of cattle and milk cows to produce milk products for trading. \r\n\r\nIn spite of these activities, this single woman finds it hard to earn a living and requested a loan for expanding her business. Gulnara was approved for the loan of 1,000 GEL with the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo that gives poor rural people the chance to start or re-start businesses. She will use the loan to purchase pigs, build a pigsty, and, after growing them, sell the pigs at a good price in the local market. With the support of the Start Up program, Gulnara will get an opportunity to enlarge her business and tackle the financial difficulties. She awaits your support.

Her eyes dance in merriment as if to punctuate her animated gestures, and the hint of a smile plays at the corners of her mouth. Packed within her petite frame is a silent strength and character that you only begin to understand as you get to know her. This is Nancy, the Chief Human Resource Manager at Juhudi Kilimo, an agricultural micro finance institution in Kenya that serves smallholder farmers.\r\n\r\nAt home, she is a committed wife to her husband and a tender, loving mother to her two children. Her small family means the world to her, so she puts them at the center of every single decision she makes in life. Growing up in a poor neighborhood, raised by poor parents, Nancy had plenty of reasons to follow the path of many girls in her hood. But she decided early in her life that she would define her own path through hard work, determination and flexibility. \r\n\r\nShe made it through University with a Bachelor of Science in Leadership and Management where she got first class honors. Nancy, upon graduating with a degree in leadership, was just piercing into the Kenyan dream with the hope of setting up unmatchable standards in the human resources and leadership practice. Like many educated Kenyans, her life seemed promising and ever improving. However, in 2010, her husband was involved in a grisly road accident that left him devastated, motionless and unconscious. The accident also rendered her husband jobless. With a young family and a jobless husband, Nancy knew that she was to tread a rocky path with dark hanging clouds. However, Nancy vowed not to let her husband's accident suppress her dreams and determination to succeed.\r\n\r\nNancy is seeking a 500,000 Kenya Shillings (KES) loan, which she will use to pay for higher education. She is undertaking a Masters in Business Administration at the United States International University (U.S.I.U.) in Kenya. The course will help her to work with productivity objectives and targets aimed at the achievement of the company\u2019s short- and long-term goals. She needs this loan from Kiva lenders, because her income is tied up, and the cost of the higher education is prohibitive. The biggest chunk of her salary is spent on general family expenses and her children\u2019s education. She became the breadwinner in her family since the day her husband was involved in the grisly road accident and rendered jobless.\r\n\r\nNancy has grown within the ranks of the Human Resource profession from a Personal Assistant, HR Assistant, to HR Officer. Nancy joined Juhudi Kilimo in 2012 as the Human Resource Manager and what really attracted her to Juhudi is the core business of financing rural farmers. Having worked in a pure for-profit organization and in particular healthcare, Nancy\u2019s desire was to join a social enterprise that would focus on the development of customers in a sustainable manner. She fell in love with Juhudi's mission, their client focus and the impact they were creating in society.\r\n\r\nNancy believes that Juhudi is at a point in time that it requires a strong and very skilled leadership team that will be able to deliver on the promises to the farmers. As an executive heading the HR function, Nancy will benefit greatly from the Masters in Business Administration from U.S.I.U. because the degree provides graduates an edge on the competition, especially for human resources management positions. Thriving businesses need great employees. They require talented and technically skilled employees to gain an edge in the marketplace\u2014that\u2019s why HR professionals play a vital role in the success of companies across an array of industries. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Nancy will continue providing for her family, educating her children and three other siblings, and furthering her education without having to stretch her income further. Nancy will use the newly acquired skills in implementing HR strategy, employee selection, talent management, compensation and benefits, training, development and formulating human resource law\r\n\r\nSupport this heroine who works tirelessly to improve the economic well-being of small holder farmers in Juhudi Kilimo and herself!\r\n

She is a group leader, often described as a very hardworking individual, and is representing her group of 10 farmers in Kakamega North District. Since joining One Acre Fund in 2013, Atlaid has noticed that she has been able to consistently feed her family.\r\n\r\nAtlaid described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study. With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Atlaid\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 5.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 5 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T16:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T16:30:18Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atlaid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kelvin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Furandina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jescah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":83580,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83580}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-11T22:33:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Smit","image":null}},{"id":795667,"name":"Daisi Judit","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Daisi de 48 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposo y sus dos hijos, ella se dedica al destace de ganado vacuno y a la comercializaci\u00f3n de la carne desde hace 11 a\u00f1os, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia, con las ganancias que obtiene logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, la clienta esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para la compra de reses vacunas por mayor para poder continuar con sus ventas y asi poder obtener mejores ingresos.","en":"Daisi is 48 years old.

He is married and the young father of three children. He was born in the countryside and since childhood he worked in the field, helping his parents. Iskandar did not get higher education, because his parents did not have money to pay for it. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Iskandar works with livestock breeding. He takes care of livestock on his plot of land. He has six heads of cattle and one horse. Iskandar's wife sells the milk he gets from the dairy cows at the market. \r\n\r\nCurrently Iskandar would like to purchase fodder for the livestock, but does not have the necessary money.

She is married and the mother of four children. Currently she works with clothing sales. She rents a stall at the market, where she conducts her business. The business is going well. She and her husband had a difficult time when they raised their children, as they did not have enough money and had to work 2-3 jobs in order to bring up their children. Despite all the difficulties, they managed to give their children a good life. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Bimarhabo also supports her children, both morally and financially. Her grandson finished school this year and entered the university, however his parents do not have the necessary amount to pay for the education. Therefore Bimarhabo decided to help them and pay for her grandson's tuition. However, she does not have the full amount and therefore she turned to MDO Arvand for financial support. She hopes that MDO Arvand responds to her request and provide the necessary amount. Bimarhabo thanks for the support and confidence in

She counts pattern parts, lays of cloth prior to cutting, number of stitches per inch during sewing operation and other measurement knowledge.\r\n\r\nA dilemma for employees like Juanita, is the improper balance of their salaries with family expenses; and they have no access to savings or conventional credit.  It's a situation that puts people in heavy debt to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Juanita is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and had no problem returning it back since the loan payment was deducted from every pay day. She looks forward for your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. \r\n\r\nJuanita will use the loan as her additional capital needed to improve her income from her variety store.\r\n\r\nJuanita hopes for everyday wisdom and strength in her workplace. She also wants her family to always be in good condition. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nCovenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers.

She is a resident of the Spitamen region. Spitamen is in the northern part of Tajikistan, not far from the city of Khujand. Nargiza works as a nurse at one of the institutions in the area. She has worked with this for around 5 years. She does not have a large pay and therefore she also keeps cattle, in order to provide the family with milk and meat. \r\n\r\nNargiza does a very good job and she has a lot of time after work.

She's single, has a 10 year old daughter and a son who's 14. Her business is weaving wool by machine. She is sincere, intelligent, generous, comprehensive, entrepreneurial, responsible and hard-working. \r\n\r\nShe does her business in the 16 de julio region, a zone known for its fair, where you can find anything from a needle to sew clothing to a tractor to sew seeds. The zone has a cold climate (4-12 degrees Celsius) and very strong sun rays that can burn skin. It's at a high altitude, 3800 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nHipolita has a dark complexion and is of medium height. She dresses traditionally (blanket, skirt and hat) and her native language is Aymara. She speaks spanish because she lives in the city. In the photo, she's seated in the center with the black\/brown striped blanket and blue apron.\r\n\r\nShe lives her life with her children who are in school. They have lived in her grandmother's house for 41 years, which is made of brick and has potable water, electricity and gas. \r\n\r\nHer desire to improve her family's quality of life led her to join a women's bank with business like food sales, soft drink sales, pants sales, weaving clothes for babies, french fry sales, athletic clothing sales and a neighborhood store and butchery, to seek a loan and improve their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is weaving wool fabrics by machine. She's been weaving for 15 years in her home, making items like women'a and men's sweaters, scarves, caps, vests, etc. to sell in bulk to her regular clients. She also sells her products while traveling to sellers in the industry. \r\n\r\nDue to the end-of-year sales, her orders have increased. To be able to fill them, she needs primary materials: bulk wool. This is the fifth series of loans within the institution in the 15 years she's been in this business. Her dream is to have a fixed point of sale, and she wants to purchase wholesale wool to weave it and fill her end-of-year orders. Because of these goals, Hipolita seeks a loan to buy wool in bulk and supply her customers with fabrics at the end of the year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1730707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wholesale wool and supply their customers with fabrics at the end of the year.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dicery Juven","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hipolita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anty Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eustaquia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suhammy Lizzet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2465.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2627.66},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2702.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2749.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2881.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2939.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3023.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3109.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":361.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":422.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":361.67,"local_amount":2465.96,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2481.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579556655},{"amount":385.39,"local_amount":2627.66,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2643.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157352},{"amount":396.36,"local_amount":2702.46,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2719.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554251},{"amount":403.26,"local_amount":2749.49,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2766.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226791},{"amount":422.69,"local_amount":2881.96,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2899.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213969},{"amount":431.16,"local_amount":2939.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2957.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564107},{"amount":899.47,"local_amount":6132.77,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6170.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046098}],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T00:21:08Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Alexander","image":1669027}},{"id":801151,"name":"Inusa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Inusa is a maize farmer and a member of Babban Gona.
