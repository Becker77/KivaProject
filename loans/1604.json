He joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his children: Sani, Idris and Tsalhatu. Before he became a Babban Gona member, Rufai would have had to sell his maize for low prices soon after harvest to provide for his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. \r\n\r\nRufai is requesting a loan to meet his immediate expenses, such as food and school fees, to eliminate pressure to sell his corn for low prices at harvest. With his loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Rufai can now store his maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. When asked, Rufai spoke of his ambition to use his additional income to educate his children. He eventually hopes to make more money for himself and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1637102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to meet expenses such as food and child school fees and eliminate pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":24477,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":24477}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-23T19:16:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":801165,"name":"Nebahat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nebahat  is married and has three children.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ezekiel\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 8.75 acres of land and purchase a total of 15 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as two solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ezekiel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Endesha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerida I","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zedekia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Levy I","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esinas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griffin W","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Uzziah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":153520,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153520}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T23:20:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":795684,"name":"Edelmira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edelmira es una mujer solitaria de 55 a\u00f1os de edad que busca a trav\u00e9s del Micro-cr\u00e9dito una soluci\u00f3n para tener una entrada de dinero suficiente para mantenerse a s\u00ed misma pues hace un tiempo su esposo la abandono dej\u00e1ndola sola.\nSu idea es montar una empresa de venta de mercanc\u00eda de cat\u00e1logo y venta de comida, con la que espera tener \u00e9xito y salir adelante, sus sue\u00f1os son triunfar para poder montar su propio local, generar empleo pero est\u00e1 consciente que iniciara de 0, pero trabajara constantemente para hacer un \u00e9xito su idea de negocio. \nCon el cr\u00e9dito comprara los insumos para iniciar formalmente su negocio a la espera que le de una alegr\u00eda. \n","en":"Edelmira is a single woman 55 years of age.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to invest in a business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Elam\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land and purchase a total of five solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T19:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T19:10:10Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philimona","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aggrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladyse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gibson","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":97270,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97270}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T02:10:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":801187,"name":"Alh.

The name of the shawl she weaves is \u201cRani Phi\u201d (local name), which requires a lot of effort to create just one shawl. \u201cIt takes ten days to complete one shawl, and one should be creative and have the skill to make this shawl,\u201d she said.

rural smallholder farmers in Kenya. Janice, a Juhudi Kilimo farmer, is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to get one and also to buy irrigation pipes. \r\n\r\nJanice lives in Chuka, a rural town in Kenya. She is a mother of three who has been practicing mixed farming for the last ten years. She enjoys milking and mixing manure. However, the climate in the region has changed rapidly, leading to long dry spells. Janice acknowledges that acquiring a water tank will be advantageous to her and the environment. \u201cAll I need is a water tank that matches my farm\u2019s requirements, and I will start reaping the benefits almost immediately.\u201d The water will serve both domestic and farming purposes. Janice\u2019s family suffers through making several trips a day to carry water over long distances during dry seasons. To Janice, storing water in tanks not only reduces their work for fetching, but also puts an end to the wastage that takes place when rain water simply drains away. The water pipes will be used in irrigating the farm, hence increasing the production level, which will translate to improved income. All that Janice waits for is your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1738409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a water tank and irrigation pipes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-23T20:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-07T20:00:12Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.57,"local_amount":8310.72,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8611.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194757},{"amount":89.52,"local_amount":7784.57,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8065.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262567},{"amount":92.22,"local_amount":8018.94,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8308.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600877},{"amount":97.65,"local_amount":8704.97,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":9019.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.46,"payment_id":681377732},{"amount":185.83,"local_amount":17180.8,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":17801.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.75,"payment_id":711505720}],"funded_date":"2014-11-23T22:44:16Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":801231,"name":"Nasreen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasreen, 39 years old, is married and has four children.

I do not want anything bad to happen to my dad, because a month ago when my father crossed the street to push the cart, he was nearly ruined by a speeding motorcycle, but God protected him and he was fine and then stuff around Jakarta .\n\nI would love to help but I can only pray for him. My father was instrumental to my family, he was tireless and tired of working hard over backwards. Morning till night, I wish that my father could be given health and longevity.\nWith a loan from Kiva, can finance my school for 3 years at a vocational high school, hopefully I can finish my study until completion, without having to burden my parents. With this loan, may be able to ease the burden on my parents. I am very upset with the condition of my parents, hopefully after I graduate I can help parents and my brothers.

is a 44 year old mother of two who lives in a Palestinian refugee camp located in North Lebanon. Her two daughters are married and she lives with her husband who also lived his whole life inside the camp. \nWhile her husband's income for his job as a painter has always been the family's only source of income, Sawsan established her own business beginning 2011 by opening a grocery store in a very crowded street in the camp.

He shares his life with his 73-year-old mother, who has a great eye sight. They live in a brick house they own. They have electricity and very recently, they also began running drinking water. \r\nHe works in the business of selling natural gas and propane tanks. People in this region are used to cooking using firewood and dung (cow feces) which they burn in clay ovens and night fires, but due to the rainy season, it is really difficult to find dry spots, so many people are forced to use gas tanks to cook, so business increases during this season. Transportation is difficult because he doesn't own a truck. His dream is to build a big house for his mother. He would like to purchase tanks in bulk to offer to his community and others nearby, because he is well known by everybody and he is the only one in this line of work. This is his first line of loans with this group in three years of working in this field. He is asking for a loan now to buy gas tanks in bulk to offer to his neighbors in need during the rainy

She is married and has two sons, who are 14 and 9, and a 3 year-old daughter. Sonia sells fast food. She is an entrepreneurial, independent, hardworking woman. She is also a good and responsible mother.\r\n\r\nShe runs her business in the neighborhood of El Tejar, which is known for informal commerce of all kinds. There are hundreds of vendors lined up side-by-side to offer meat, vegetables and other food; and things like clothing. These vendors sell in good weather or bad.\r\n\r\nSonia has a dark complexion and is of average height. She has long dark hair which she braids, and she wears traditional clothing (a hat, shawl and sweater). Her native language is Aymara, but she speaks Spanish for business. \r\n\r\nShe is going through life along with her husband, who sells chickens. Their older children are school-aged and are studying. They live together in a rented house which has electricity and drinkable water, though they still do not have a sewage system because their area was only recently urbanized.\r\n\r\nSonia sells food such as fried chicken and \"pollo al espiedo\" (oven-cooked chicken). She currently rents a small room which she uses both as kitchen and restaurant. She always has customers and so her business is prosperous. Sonia's dream is to purchase the house where she has her business, because the location is known. She also wants to grow her business by purchasing a food stall from which she will sell \"salchipapas\" (french fries and sausages cut up in slices). \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan cycle that this bank has had for this type of business in 6 years. For this reason, Sonia requests a loan to purchase the food stall in order to sell salchipapas and grow her food business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1730895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T00:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T00:00:01Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":442.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":404.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":408.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":426.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":480.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":455.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":507.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":508.68},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":531.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":562.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":564.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":623.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":631.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":654.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":695.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":718.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":749.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":635.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":122.77,"local_amount":846.67,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":848.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157357},{"amount":59.25,"local_amount":408.62,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":409.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554256},{"amount":61.91,"local_amount":426.97,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":427.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226796},{"amount":1206.07,"local_amount":8317.74,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8333.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636213974}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T01:03:41Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":801519,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna works hard to support her family.

She decided to invest in her Sistema Biobolsa biodigester in order to generate savings by displacing the wood and expensive LP gas she used to buy, as well as to protect the environment and improve her and her family's health. Prior to owning the biodigester, she cooked and heated water with wood, resulting in the exposure of her family to harmful smoke, which she was inhaling while cooking. <br \/><br \/>From now on, the waste of her cows, hogs and poultry will allow her to produce her own biogas, resulting in a smoke-free kitchen and water heated through this renewable energy.

She is single and has one son who is 18 years old. Neisi prepares and sells traditional empanadas. She is strong, entrepreneurial, persevering, responsible and hardworking. She runs her business in the \"plan 3000\" neighborhood which is characterized by the huge expansion of its population, many of whom are emigrants from outlying areas such as the Ayores area; as well as miners who relocated from the western part of the country. Their area is tropical with a warm and humid climate. The average temperatures are around 30 degrees Celsius all year long. \r\n\r\nNeisi has a dark complexion and is short with long gray hair which she braids. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed and she also speaks Spanish.\r\n\r\nShe lives her life with her son, who is currently in the last year of school and hoping to continue his studies. They live in their own home which is built of brick and which she inherited from her family. They have drinkable water and electricity.\r\n\r\nNeisi runs her business on foot, selling empanadas. She makes them with a fine bread dough as well as pastry dough which she turns into puff pastry and fills with a sweet or savory mixture and cooks in the oven. She usually uses wheat flour, though sometimes she uses corn or other grains. In addition to the empanadas, her baked goods include \"cu\u00f1ape\" (cheesy bread), \"sonso\" (ground yucca with cheese), and rice bread (which is made with rice flour). \r\n\r\nNeisi's dream is to run her business out of a fixed location so that she doesn't have to work by foot anymore. She also hopes to purchase a variety of flours (rice, wheat, white, etc.) to be better-stocked so that she doesn't run out during the end-of-year celebrations. The end of the year is the time when it becomes most difficult for her to buy in bulk and when all the prices go up.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan of this type that Emprender has seen in 2 years, and for this reason Neisi requests a loan to purchase a variety of flour in bulk so that she can sell empanadas at the end of the year.

She lives with her husband. They have been practicing mixed farming for the last 30 years. Their five children pay a visit from time to time, and offer assistance on the farm when needed. Her primary income sources are eggs and milk produced on the farm. She sells these at a local market. \r\n\r\nA while ago, Mary joined a self-help group named Njeruni comprised of mostly marginalized female farmers. All the members of this group were in search of new ways to generate income. Kiva Field Partner Juhudi Kilimo motivated them to secure a loan and have the members guarantee each other. After being successfully registered, they went through a training of basic financial and business skills. \r\n\r\nMary is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to purchase pigs. She is looking to diversify into other farming activities. She is always cautious when approaching new business opportunities. The fact that she spends most of her time at the farm makes her confident that she can take good care of the pigs. With the loan, she will be able to sell pork, which has a ready market in the Chuka area and also in the neighboring towns. Income generated from this investment will be enough to meet her farm's expenses. She says her family will also get to enjoy all of the benefits that come along with increased income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1738466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.2,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.96,"local_amount":5053.37,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5311.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194759},{"amount":53.37,"local_amount":4574.75,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4808.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262569},{"amount":56.11,"local_amount":4809.52,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5055.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600878},{"amount":59.56,"local_amount":5233.93,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5501.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.5,"payment_id":681377734},{"amount":59.75,"local_amount":5445.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5724.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.78,"payment_id":711505722},{"amount":55.05,"local_amount":4882.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5132.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":752110769}],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T05:05:24Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Camille Ricketts","image":991896}},{"id":801276,"name":"Biakoye Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These seven members of the Biakoye Group are on average, 41 years old with three children.

The region's staple food is \u201cMursik,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from milk. Jane has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. Selling eggs and milk has earned her a decent income. She also engages in another business to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nJane passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every morning to milk her cow. While this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nJane is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With this loan, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand. Through Kiva Field Partner Juhudi Kilimo, she attended training sessions and was taught financial management skills. This will help her save more money, repay the loan fully, and improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1738482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T00:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T00:40:10Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3000.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3088.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3178.73},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3271.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3367.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3465.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3566.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3671.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3778.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3888.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4002.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4119.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.35,"local_amount":4048.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4086.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194760},{"amount":34.78,"local_amount":3104.44,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3133.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824191},{"amount":35.09,"local_amount":3132.54,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262570},{"amount":37.66,"local_amount":3361.44,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3392.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264623},{"amount":38.62,"local_amount":3447.64,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600879},{"amount":80.11,"local_amount":7330.84,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7399.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.02,"payment_id":681377735},{"amount":40.02,"local_amount":3687.13,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3721.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.29,"payment_id":696587394},{"amount":41.35,"local_amount":3924.19,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3960.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.61,"payment_id":711505723},{"amount":111.47,"local_amount":10363.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10460.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.63,"payment_id":731022519}],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T02:55:45Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Camille Ricketts","image":991896}},{"id":801278,"name":"Sirvard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sirvard is from Saramej village in the Lori region. She lives with her husband and son. Sirvard, with the help of her husband, is breeding livestock including cows, calves and hens. They are also cultivating wheat, potatoes and cabbage. Livestock breeding and plant cultivation are very important sources of income for the family. To be able to continue, Sirvard needs a loan of USD 2,000 to purchase two tires for the combine, two oxen, and forage for feeding the livestock. \r\n\r\nSirvard has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, she has been able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments.

She is married to Wilfredo and they have three children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nRufina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRufina wants to have her store renovated. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1738941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Sari Wangi Ternak members intend to continue borrowing from MUK, because in addition to providing loans, MUK also provides training and a consulting veterinarian for free.\r\n\r\nNi Kadek managed to sell the piglets with a satisfactory price. She earned 150,000 IDR profit per pig. She will save the profit to expand the business. She hopes that MUK will always accompany the group until all members are independent.\r\n\r\nTo continue the effort and increase the number of pigs, the Sari Wangi Ternak group took the next loan for the same amount. These loans are used to purchase piglets, especially the superior type.

This new loan will go to additional stock of groceries, toiletries and beverages. Her customers will likely buy more items if she has more of her products displayed in her store. An increase in sales will also result in a significant increase in profit. This will result in her business becoming viable and sustainable. Simultaneously, she could sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nAside from increasing her profit, Jasmine wants to give her family a good life.

She has told us a lot of interesting things about AUCA and I attended many events on campus. Based on this experience, I decided to apply to this University. I worked to get high exam scores and was accepted.\r\n \r\nWhy did I choose AUCA? Firstly, AUCA strives to provide the best education to those students, like me, who want to change their world for the better. Secondly, it allows us to study in various good universities in the World through Exchange Programs that are sponsored by either AUCA or partner institutions. Finally, a truly international atmosphere at AUCA makes you feel as a part of a big friendly family.\r\n \r\nMy parents support my choice and do their best to pay my tuition. However, I have other siblings they need to take care of with their small salary, which makes it nearly impossible to cover my education in full. Therefore, a Kiva loan is critical for me and my family. I am very fortunate to have this opportunity to mobilize some resources through Kiva, and greatly appreciate the lenders\u2019 trust and their help to me.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1739021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Life is quite a struggle for she is a widow with six children. She works doubly hard to support her children and provide for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nMargarita owns and oversees operation of her jeepney service. She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) of jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, the jeepneys are packed with passengers. Jeepneys offer one of the cheapest ways of getting somewhere. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the second World War and are still to be seen throughout the Philippines, in many colors and all over the place. \r\n\r\nOriginally, jeepneys were old American Jeeps. They were used in the war against the Japanese army who occupied the Philippines for several years. After the Japanese army was defeated and the American military mission was completed, the Jeeps were left by the tens of thousands on the islands in the Philippines. The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these Jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these Jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals. Jeepney transport service is one of the stable businesses in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Margarita is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan, which she will use to recondition\/restore the used tires of her jeepney to a usable condition. It is very important that her unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. Her earnings from the service is her only source of income to provide for her family's needs.  She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nMargarita aims to have one more jeepney unit to improve her income. She prays that her transportation service will always be safe and efficient. She dreams for her children to get the best education.

She studied up to the fourth grade and says that she could not continue studying due to the difficult financial situation when she was a little girl. Besides, there were no schools close to where she lived and it was unsafe to go out because of the war and the unsafe conditions it caused. She is now living with her three children, who go to school and are the only ones that depend on her.\r\n\r\nCeferina works taking care of the household chores and her three children, who live with her. However, her main activity is making all kinds of clothes for women, children and men. She learned to do this because she attended a workshop, thinking of being self-employed. She is now very good at it. She says that she has been doing this for twelve years, so she receives a lot of orders from customers that come to her with different needs.\r\n\r\nShe has a lot of work and what she likes about her job is that she can work from home. Some days there are a lot of things to sew, so she has to stay up late. She has taught her children, who help her when this happens. She has an additional activity and her daughter helps her. They make traditional snacks, such as tamales, fried cassava, pies, etc. These two activities are a source of income for her and her family.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy a more modern and efficient sewing machine. She has a lot of orders to fulfill and the machine she has cannot cope with the work. With the help of this loan and the new machine, she will be able to do her job more easily and in a shorter time, which was something she wanted long ago. Thanks to this, Ceferina will make better profits for her family.\r\n\r\nCeferina would like to expand her dressmaking business in the future and open a workshop where young people can learn this profitable activity. She would also continue supporting her children\u2019s studies so that they can receive a university degree and become good people. She says that she will achieve all these goals with the profits she will make and with other loans she will request in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1731516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a more modern and efficient sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T13:30:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#HiddenGem"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":64.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":68.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75.93},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80.22},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82.85},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":97.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.64},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.28},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.93},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.84},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.22},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.85},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.9,"local_amount":63.9,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":63.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146174},{"amount":23.84,"local_amount":23.84,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":23.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769678},{"amount":1412.26,"local_amount":1412.26,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1412.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833307}],"funded_date":"2014-12-05T01:57:03Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:06:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":802050,"name":"John's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 45 years old, has 7 children, and lives in Itacho A village in Kuria East, Kenya.

Joshua volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help his community. There are also 2 other volunteer promoters from the community who are part of this group loan, namely Jane and Michael.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Joshua\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1740759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T13:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T13:30:05Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joshua ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micheal ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":74,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-02T23:05:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":802078,"name":"Esther's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 42 years old, has 6 children, and lives in Kebondari A village in Kuria East, Kenya.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am from Osh, in the south part of Kyrgyzstan. I moved to Bishkek, a different city, to study at AUCA.  This move has not been easy for me, as I have never lived separately from my family before. Thanks to God, we have relatives here and I live for free in their house; otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be able to live in such an expensive city as Bishkek (compared to Osh).\r\n\r\nI have a big family of six people. Both my parents are educated; they are trained professionals with a higher education. However, due to limited jobs in their field, they are employed in completely different areas. They used to run a small caf\u00e9 in Osh, but we lost it after the ethnic clashes in 2010. We had hard times; my parents tried to save money somehow, but we were growing and needed much more money.\r\n\r\nLast year I was a winner of FLEX Program and lived one year in the USA. This program gave me so much courage and belief in myself that I told myself I will try to study at the best University, volunteer, and do everything to help my little siblings, who study at school. Also, empowering other teens to stand up, speak loud, and make a change in our community. I can say thank you to the FLEX Program. \r\n\r\nHaving the opportunity to support my education, and my family, with the KIVA loan is extremely important, and I am thankful to KIVA lenders all ever the world for believing in me and investing in my future!\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1739049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

On her farm she currently has four cows, two calves, 24 sheep and one colt.\r\n\r\nSince she needs to pay for her daughters' education and help her son and her income isn't nearly enough to do so, Nurzhamal has decided to develop her business. Therefore she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 KGS to purchase sheep. She wants to put profits from the loan into further increasing her head count of livestock, which will allow her to improve her family's living conditions and to build a house for her son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1265.09,"image":{"id":1736782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

It is a beautiful and unique city. She is married to a builder and they have a grown son who is a university student. She is proud of her son and hopes that he will have a successful career in his field.\r\n\r\nMatluba has been working as a seamstress for many years. She takes orders to sew women's clothing, as Tajiks prefer to sew themselves dresses rather than buying them. Many young girls learn to sew after finishing school and start sewing businesses, and Matluba is no exception. She learned to sew from her mother, who passed all her experience and skill on to her daughter. For many years, Matluba has been sewing on the old machine that you see in the photo. She very much wants to buy a new, modern machine, so that she can use all the new features, which will help her do new things. She has wanted to buy a new machine for a long time but has not been able to save the necessary amount of money. She believes and hopes that with your help she will succeed in buying a sewing
