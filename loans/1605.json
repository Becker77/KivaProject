Administration. Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am an ordinary, but very ambitious teenager. My life changed when I was 14 and started break dancing. Dancing taught me a lot of important things in this life. Once I lost a big competition and was sad. My parents encouraged me telling me that, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill me, that makes me stronger\u201d. I practiced more and began to take part in different contests. The next year I won seven big battles in a row and was announced as \u201cThe best break dancer of Kyrgyzstan in 2012\u201d. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 15, I met an amazing magician, who surprised me and was presenting smiles for this world. I loved watching at him, but wanted to try to do the same actions at home. I was lucky to become an illusionist myself and taught other guys. We organized more than 50 shows and 3 concerts gathering more than 15,000 people and made 7 videos that year. Such successes directed me onto the charity, so together with organizations such as \u201cVoice of Freedom\u201d, \u201cHouse of Volunteers\u201d, \u201cEl studio\u201d, we have organized many concerts and shows for the children in cancer centers, orphanages and nursing houses.\r\n\r\nI think that my mission in this world is not finished and I can do more exciting things along with my study at AUCA. I understand that hobbies are good and free entertainment, but I need to get a higher education to be sure of my future, and hope I will be the best at AUCA, too. Your loan will help me win many more \u201clife contests and battles\u201d that will have positive impact on my community. Thank you in advance.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1739076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

She is part of a Christian group which maintains relationships with a broad community. It was there that the idea of generating income by responding to the needs, desires, and interests of their potential customers was born.  Two years ago they became regular customers.\r\n\r\nToday she has a shop at her house where she displays stationery items in a showcase. She needs to adapt it to each season. Now that December is approaching, Yaneth must stock up with Christmas stationery; simple and inexpensive items that her clients will want since bonuses awaken their need to go shopping. Her clients are mostly the neighbors from her community.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to grow her business and to provide a quality education for her children, but her big challenge is not  having enough money to do this. This is the very reason why she is asking for a KIVA loan which is the first one with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the money to buy Christmas stationery, balloons, glitter, women's accessories, and other seasonal items. This investment will allow her business to improve because she will sell  much more and increase her profits, making her KIVA loan a successful investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1731569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stationery products and general merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T14:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":140.88,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaneth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":140924},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":145152},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":149506},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":153991},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":158611},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":163370},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":168271},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":173319},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":178518},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":183874},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":189390},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":195074}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.35,"local_amount":140924,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":144133.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.35,"payment_id":595164370},{"amount":67.18,"local_amount":145152,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:47:19Z","rounded_local_amount":148457.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.58,"payment_id":611789264},{"amount":63.05,"local_amount":149506,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":152911,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.84,"payment_id":624849470},{"amount":69.11,"local_amount":153991,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":157498.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.96,"payment_id":636603556},{"amount":74.65,"local_amount":158611,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":162223.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.67,"payment_id":649571763},{"amount":72.34,"local_amount":163370,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":167090.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.3,"payment_id":666497133},{"amount":70.51,"local_amount":168271,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":172103.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.52,"payment_id":681350250},{"amount":65.36,"local_amount":173319,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":177266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.13,"payment_id":696560531},{"amount":66.38,"local_amount":178518,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":182583.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.65,"payment_id":711475277},{"amount":220.19,"local_amount":568338,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":581281.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":56.88,"payment_id":730994170}],"funded_date":"2014-12-08T11:33:17Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T14:24:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":801708,"name":"Melvin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melvin is 32 years old and has three children, two of whom are in school.

She has two children, ages 15 and 7, and her business is selling breakfast.  She's responsible, enterprising, persevering, and hardworking, and a good mother.\r\n\r\nShe carries out her business in the Plan 3000 zone, an area known for population growth.  Migrants from the area of the Ayorea people and miners relocated from the western region are responsible for the commercial growth.  The area has a warm and humid tropical climate with a constant temperature of 30 degrees centigrade throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nJudith is dark and of average height, and she wears her black hair long (third woman from the left, wearing a blue blouse with white flowers).  Her native language is Guarani and she speaks Spanish.  She lives with her partner, who earns a living in construction, and her children, both of whom attend school.  The entire family lives in their own room, with potable water and electricity.\r\n\r\nThe need to achieve her goals led Judith to form a bank with people who have businesses--such as a neighborhood store, a butcher shop, sandwich sales, plaster crafts, soft drink sales, a bookstore, and clothing sales--to request a loan and improve their businesses.\r\n\r\nJudith's business is selling breakfast.

Her business is the sale of clothes, toys, and seasonal products.\r\n\r\nShe is independent, entrepreneurial, hardworking, responsible, and a good mother. She conducts her business in the \u201cplan 3000\u201d area, known for its growing commerce in all areas. The area has rainy, tropical weather and a constant temperature of 30\u00b0C [86\u00b0F] throughout the whole year.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe is dark-skinned, medium-statured, and has long, curly, black hair and a robust physique. Her native language is Quechua and she speaks Spanish. In the photo, she is standing and wearing an animal print blouse. She shares her life with her son who is not in school yet. They live in their own family house, made of brick, and they have potable water and electricity. \r\n\r\nHer desire for self-improvement motivated her to form a group of people with businesses such as: selling empanadas, cosmetics trade, selling seasonal clothes, machine knitting, selling cell phone accessories, selling furniture, selling quilts, making leather purses, and selling meat pies. She formed this group to request a loan and improve the group\u2019s activities. \r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of clothes, toys, and seasonal products. She sells them as a street vendor in fairs and markets. She sells products according to the season. For example, in the Christmas season she buys toys, Christmas ornaments, Christmas trees, lights, etc. on wholesale to sell them in the fairs and markets. After Christmas, she buys things for the Carnaval celebrations such as costumes, water balloons, and water guns. In both seasons she sells clothes. Her marketing revolves around the date and the holiday.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own store in a fixed, commercial location so that she can stop moving around.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Nelly\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 7.75 acres of land and purchase a total of six solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1733899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabeti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jastone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nedi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":134310,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134310}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-28T05:04:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":800097,"name":"Anara","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430, 30 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 -

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Emily\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 7.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 15 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1733880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation, as well as two solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linnet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Difina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabeti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisheba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":110910,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110910}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T21:09:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":801753,"name":"Haja Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 39 year-old Haja.

unwilling nature of formal financial institutions to set up shops in remote areas. They say the rural population is unevenly dispersed and the farmers make low incomes, irregularly. \r\n\r\nSupported by Kiva, Juhudi Kilimo penetrates remote regions to finance agricultural assets and farm inputs to improve productivity and profitability of rural enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Edwin is seeking a loan of KES  65,000 to purchase potatoes and beans to grow and harvest on his horticultural farm. He will also use the money to buy pesticide to ensure that his crops are not attached by bugs predominating the farms in the area. \r\n\r\nIncome from this venture will help Edwin repay the loan, take care of his wife, and take his four children to school. Edwin's family will be very grateful to Kiva lenders for their kind hearts, to spare their needs and help Edwin raise money to move his family forward.

She is married and has children. She has been employed by a garment factory in Cavite for two years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nMaricel works as a clothing packer. She ensures that items of clothing are packed in the correct way ready for distribution. The type of packaging used depends on the type, value, fabric and destination of the garments.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Maricel, is their salaries do not meet family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit. This situation makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maricel is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem repaying them because loan payments are deducted every pay day.  She looks forward to your positive response and any loan money will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for their household expenses and she will also help her mother.\r\n\r\nMaricel wants to have her own house and manage a business someday. She meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1739242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for her family's needs and help her mother.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":752.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536033},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134387},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757155},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200293},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186582},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535660},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.63,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":752.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665016939}],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T22:15:10Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T12:53:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":801751,"name":"Monjama J","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 30 year-old Monjama.

is from Cavite, Philippines. Her partner is Herson and they have three children. She has been employed by a garment factory in Cavite for almost two years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nLydia is a clothing presser. She presses fabrics or garments during the production process (known as under-pressing) as well in the final stages of production (usually in a garment-finishing department). Sometimes, she helps in the sewing process and other production processes if necessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Lydia, is their salaries don't cover family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit. This situation makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Lydia is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. She looks forward for your positive response and any loan will surely be of great help. She will be incorporating the loan as her starting capital for her sandal-making business.\r\n\r\nLydia wants to give her children a better future through all her hard work. She meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

De clima c\u00e1lido tropical con una temperatura promedio de 30 grados cent\u00edgrados durante todo el a\u00f1o.\nIsabel es de tez morena, cabello negro y gris, estatura mediana, su lengua materna es el guaran\u00ed y habla espa\u00f1ol para el comercio (la primera de la izquierda, pantal\u00f3n azul y blusa amarilla).  Su vida la realiza con sus tres hijos, porque se separ\u00f3 de su esposo, la familia vive en una casa propia de ladrillo y cuenta con agua potable y luz el\u00e9ctrica. La necesidad de alimentar a su familia generando mejores recursos econ\u00f3micos la hizo formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de vajillas, venta de celulares, venta de carne de pollo, venta de flores, servicio de t\u00e9, taller de costura y elaboraci\u00f3n de empanadas, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y prosperar en sus negocios.

Esta es la tercera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en dos a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Isabel solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de harina y dem\u00e1s ingredientes por mayor para aumentar su producci\u00f3n y llegar a m\u00e1s clientes.\n","en":"Isabel, 49, is married and has three children, ages 23, 15, and 13.  Her business is a bakery.  She's independent, enterprising, responsible, and hardworking, and she's a good mother.\r\n\r\nIsabel carries out her business in the Plan 3000 zone, an area known for cultural diversity.  Area ethnic groups such as the Ayorea people and miners relocated from the western part of the country settled in the area, as did families affected by droughts, poor Bolivians, Colla people born in the most remote corners of the country, Guarani people, and Chiquitano people, among many other ethnic groups.  The climate is warm and tropical, with an average temperature of 30 degrees centigrade throughout the entire year. \r\n\r\nIsabel is dark and of average height, and has black and gray hair (the first one on the left, with blue pants and a yellow blouse).  Her native language is Guarani and she speaks Spanish for business.  She lives with her three children because she's separated from her husband.  They live in their own house, which is made of brick, and have potable water and electricity.\r\n\r\nThe need to earn a better income to feed her family led Isabel to form a bank with people with businesses--such as mobile phone sales, chicken meat sales, flower sales, tea service, tailoring, and making empanadas--to request a loan and prosper in their businesses.\r\n\r\nIsabel's business is a bakery.  She started a home business selling cakes more than two years ago.  She's still a home business but is more organized.  In the beginning sales were scare, but they have increased.  It's still a micro-business.  A close family member is diabetic, so little by little she developed specialized products for diabetic; that way they don't feel excluded and they can enjoy the celebrations.\r\n\r\nFor this Christmas she has her now-traditional Christmas cake--with fruit, raisins, walnuts, plums, coffee, and rum!  But she's also making low-sugar cakes and gluten-free cakes.  Her dream is to expand her business and fulfill wholesale orders from stores, markets, and supermarkets.\r\n\r\nFor those reasons, Isabel's requesting a loan to buy flour and other ingredients wholesale to increase her production and reach more customers.  This is her third loan sequence with the institution in the two years she has been in this business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4675,"image":{"id":1731591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. \r\n\r\nIrine, however, is taking this a little step further. Irine is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes.

She is married, and she and her husband have 2 children, both of whom are already in college. \r\n\r\nRizalita has been employed as a Sewer in a garment factory in Cavite for 2 years now through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*. She does the sewing and designing of clothing apparel according to the company's or client\u2019s demands. She sews clothes using a sewing machine and other stitching machines, but she often hand-stitches the edges and linings as well.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas for employees like Rizalita is the improper balance between salaries and family expenses. As a result, they have no access to savings or credit - a situation that makes them vulnerable to usurious money lenders, who take their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Rizalita is asking for your assistance in preventing her from being exposed to predatory lenders. She has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, which she was able to successfully repay since the loan payments were deducted every payday. \r\n\r\nRizalita plans to use her loan to pay for the tuition fees of her children.

Kenya. This is a region with good weather patterns that favor crop and animal farming. She resides with her 40-year-old husband and they are blessed with three beautiful children. \r\n\r\nLydia has been actively involved in mixed farming for the past 10 years and she sells milk, eggs and various varieties of food crops at a local market and to her neighbors. She passionately loves poultry farming. The biggest challenge she is currently facing is lack of quality breeds of poultry that are disease resistant and grow well. To solve this problem she is kindly seeking a loan from Kiva lenders, via Juhudi Kilimo, to purchase additional poultry that grow well. Having additional poultry will provide her with practical benefits since she will be able to increase her egg productivity and also sell good quality poultry meat. Through the loan she will increase her profit margins and this will translate to better living conditions for her family. Lydia believes that through proper feeding of her poultry with high quality feed, they will grow even better. Other than profits from poultry she will benefit from chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen compared to other livestock manure. \r\n\r\nLydia is comfortable with the repayment period and monthly installments and promises to make payments all throughout the repayment

is a resident of Laguna, Philippines. She has children and she is working in a garment factory. She was employed through the assistance of Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.<br \/><br \/>Juliet is a Roving Quality Control Officer. She inspects garments, such as men's denim bottoms, during manufacturing operations to determine the number of defects per worker and reasons for rejects by examiners. She counts the number of pattern parts, layers of cloth prior to cutting, number of stitches per inch during sewing operations and collects other measurement knowledge.<br \/><br \/>One of the main dilemmas of employees, like Juliet, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and having no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, Juliet is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in paying them back since the loan payment is deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay for her tricycle unit.<br \/><br \/>Juliet wants to be free from all her debt and become financially stable someday. She dreams of giving her family a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. <br \/><br \/>* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

Lenders! The above picture presents to you Naomi, who is a hard-working, creative, and ingenious woman and a passionate farmer. She is a mother of two lovely children. She hails from the Thika area of Kenya, a region known for growing pineapples. Naomi was raised in challenging circumstances and her basic needs were never covered, so she vowed she would turn her life around and live a comfortable life. That is why she started mixed farming, and she has been farming for the past 20 years. Through dedication, hard work and commitment, she has been able to provide for the basic needs of her family. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes some profit, she has the challenge of an inadequate water supply for irrigating her crops and even for her home consumption. Most of the rain water is wasted, and Naomi wants to harvest that water. That is why she is kindly requesting a loan to buy a water tank. The Thika area has no piped water, and this means that you have to travel for long distances in search of \u201cthis precious commodity.\u201d But, with the loan, she will be able to store water for home consumption. The loan will also help Naomi irrigate her farm. She plans to use the sprinkle irrigation method, so that there will be a high production level on her farm. \r\n\r\nNaomi always says water is a very precious commodity and should not go to waste. Having access to funds is very challenging for African women, but with partners such as Kiva and Juhudi Kilimo, Naomi is sure that her dreams will become a reality and she will be able to improve her living conditions. The profits from increased production of crops will be used to repay the loan and also to improve her living conditions. She also plans to buy more water tanks so that she can harvest as much water as possible. Naomi awaits your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":165.71,"image":{"id":1739329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a water tank.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T19:30:06Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1061.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1092.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1124.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1226.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1261.89},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1298.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1336.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1375.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.3},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.15},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.26,"local_amount":1736.97,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1823.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194764},{"amount":18.06,"local_amount":1547.79,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1625.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824200},{"amount":54.47,"local_amount":4669.1,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4902.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264627},{"amount":71.05,"local_amount":6249.99,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6562.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.87,"payment_id":681377740}],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T19:58:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":801866,"name":"Donathille","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Donathille is aged 44.

tiempos solo trabajaban mucho la agricultura  y los padres  no los pon\u00edan a estudiar.\n\n Esta acompa\u00f1ado,  la esposa se dedica a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos y son padres de 10 hijos, de los cuales 7 viven con \u00e9l y 3 est\u00e1n en la escuela y 4 que le ayudan en la agricultura y tres que est\u00e1n trabajando y en hogares apartes, con Santos solo viven  los 7 hijos,  la esposa y un nieto.\n\nSantos  se dedica a la agricultura desde que ten\u00eda 8  a\u00f1os de edad, este trabajo se lo ense\u00f1o el pap\u00e1,  para que en un futuro se pudieran defender; el lugar de trabajo  est\u00e1 a  15 minutos y \u00e9l viaja a pie, en horario de las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las doce del mediod\u00eda \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que est\u00e1 solicitando, es para pagar la semana de una persona  que le ayude a trabajar en la milpa, ya que un  hijo sali\u00f3 fuera del pa\u00eds y siente que se atrasara para sacar la cosecha, por eso necesita a una persona que le ayude en ausencia de su hijo.  El cr\u00e9dito anterior lo ocupo para comprar tubos de la energ\u00eda electrifica,  ya que en la casa no ten\u00edan  y de donde pasaban los cables necesitaban cuatro tubos para pasar los cables cerca de la casa,  esto le ayudo mucho ya que hoy Santos ya tiene la energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica en su casa.\n\n\n","en":"Santos is 55 years old and wasn't able to go to school, since back then children were put to work on the farms and parents didn't send them to school.\r\n\r\nHe is in a common-law marriage and lives with his wife, who is a homemaker. They have ten children together, seven of whom still live with them. Three of the seven attend school and four help him farm. The three that live on their own have other jobs. One grandson also lives with them.\r\n\r\nSantos has been working as a farmer since he was eight years old. He learned from his father, who taught him so that he would be able to fend for himself in the future. His place of work is fifteen minutes away and he walks there. His schedule is from 6:00 am to noon. \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan he is requesting to pay the weekly salary of a laborer to help him with his corn fields. One of his sons is out of the country and he thinks he might fall behind in the harvest. That is why he needs another person to help him during his son's absence. \r\n\r\nSantos used his previous loan to install electricity in his home, which they didn't have. He had to buy four tubes to connect to the nearest utility wires. This helped him very much, and today he has electrical power at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1732148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-22T12:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666802716}],"funded_date":"2014-11-24T21:00:03Z","paid_date":"2015-06-22T12:15:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":801856,"name":"Nh\u00f3m 04_Th\u00f4n 5_Minh Ch\u00e2u Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T\u01b0\u01a1i is the group leader of the Nh\u00f3m 04_th\u00f4n 5_Minh Ch\u00e2u solidarity group, which consists of 5 members. \r\n\r\nT\u01b0\u01a1i is 52 years old and she is married with 2 children..

This is a mechanical device that is used in cutting hay into small pieces before it\u2019s mixed with forage and then fed to livestock. This method prevents the animal from rejecting any part of the food, hence increasing the cow's milk production. With the money from her additional sales of milk, Margaret will be able to service her loan on time. \r\n\r\nAs well, with the increased income made possible with the loan, Margaret will be able to meet the cost of high quality production.

For family functions and festivals, crowds of customers flock to the fish markets. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy raw materials and fishes to raise in their pond to expand the pond and sell the big fishes for income generation. She also aspires to buy a half acre of paddy land for her own cultivation in the near future if the fishery business is successful. With the Kiva loan, she will expand her fishery business and save money to buy her desired paddy land. She is very excited to get the loan and wishes success to the lenders.

She has a fourteen-year-old son and works selling traditional food. She is a good mother and a hard worker. She is independent, persevering, patient, and responsible. She runs her business in the southern area of the city, known for its commercial activity. The weather is warm, humid, and tropical in the city, with year-round constant temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius (86 F).\r\n\r\nMartha is the first person from the right in the picture, wearing a pink shirt and jeans. Her skin is dark, her height is average, and she has long black hair. Quechua is her first language, and she speaks Spanish for work. She lives with her son, who is in school. They own a brick house, which has water and electricity. \r\n\r\nThe need to expand her business led her to form a communal bank with people in other businesses in order to apply for a loan and meet her goals. The other members work selling soft drinks, selling baby clothes, selling fried potatoes, at a neighborhood store, at a butcher shop, selling sandwiches, making plaster crafts, and at a bookstore. \r\n\r\nMartha works selling traditional food. She makes things like \"locro de gallina\" (boiled fried chicken), \"majadito de charque\" (dried meat, yellow rice, fried egg, and fried plantain), \"lagua de choclo\" (corn soup with meat), \"capirotada\" (bone soup with grated cheese),  \"masaco de yuca\" (oven-baked boiled cassava and dried meat), and other dishes. She works Monday through Sunday because her business is constant and she has no rest. Her customers are regulars, because they know the flavor and the good recipes of her food, which make her business successful. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a big restaurant where she could offer a wide variety of traditional dishes. She wants to expand her business by purchasing tables and chairs, because the ones she has are old and some of them are broken. This is her fourth loan with this organization and she has been in business for three years. These are the reasons why Martha is requesting a loan to buy tables and chairs, so that she can achieve her dream of having a restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5175,"image":{"id":1732142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

That loan helped her very much in increasing and enlarging her business. \r\n\r\nShe was able to export her goods (which are perfumes, incense, ready made women's clothes and other goods) to her relatives in Saudi Arabia for them to sell. \r\n\r\nAmna is warmly thankful for Kiva lenders for their first loan. In fact, Amna couldn't complete the first loan and applied for a concurrent loan of 40,000 YER from Kiva lenders to purchase more goods (fabrics, perfume, incense) to export to Saudi Arabia. Her relatives there sell them and earn a good amount of money.\r\n\r\nAmna hopes to be financed in this loan too."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":666.92,"image":{"id":1739481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Islamic Finance"],"use":"to buy more fabrics, incense and perfumes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"hodeidah","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-11-24T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-08T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joma`a","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14449},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14141},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14141}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":14449,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14608.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610478954},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":14141,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":14297.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624781602},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":14141,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":14297.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636140170},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":14141,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-21T12:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":14297.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":650499487},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":14141,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-25T12:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":14297.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665378405},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":14141,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-29T12:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14297.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681273241},{"amount":133.1,"local_amount":28282,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-23T12:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":28594.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711392442},{"amount":66.54,"local_amount":14141,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-28T12:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":14297.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730915285},{"amount":66.54,"local_amount":14141,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":14297.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752006449}],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T14:53:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":794765,"name":"Adjovi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Adjovi est mari\u00e9e et jeune maman d\u2019un enfant.

most people hitting the 40 year mark will mean a life of absolute reliance on their children or immediate family members for livelihood. However, for Melisa life begins at 40. Melisa owns 2 acres of land in Turbo Village, in the Eldoret area of Kenya. She has no formal education and has been practising mixed farming since 2007. Agriculture is fundamental to Kenya's economy. But it is much more than an economic activity. Farmers like Melisa are stewards of Kenya\u2019s countryside and provide the citizens with the option of buying locally-produced food. \r\n\r\nMelisa started farming in 2007 after the country suffered post-election violence. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his 2 acres, she has grown the business dramatically. She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines and a Poshomill, to help her run the farm. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in a sector that feeds the population. \r\n\r\nMelisa is seeking a loan to purchase more land. Her operations are growing consistently, eating up the available space. With your funding, Melisa will have more space to expand her business output. \r\n\r\nThe money from the investment will be ploughed back into the business, to finance even more growth. The additional income will also enable her to repay the loan, buy food for her family, and pay fees for her children who are in public schools. \r\n\r\nShe feels blessed to have the support of her husband, through all her undertakings. Make a $25 loan, and push Melisa's dream closer to reality.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1265.76,"image":{"id":1739514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

These activities generate income to support her household and, little by little, achieve the quality of life she dreams of for her family. She founded her business two years ago because she felt the need to occupy herself with an activity that would be both fulfilling for herself and her family, particularly with respect to increasing the family income. Her motivation was high, and she began working within reach of what she already knew. \r\n\r\nThe products and services that Kelly offers are intended for the final consumer, and her fixed clientele are made up of neighbors, family friends, and referrals that she sells to on a cash or account basis.

She would like to provide a quality education to her children. Her main challenge is not being able to count on sufficient capital that would allow her to immediately invest in her dreams of prosperity. Currently, she is applying for a Kiva loan through which she will purchase a dryer, wholesale nail polish, manicure equipment, hair combs and brushes, and bags. With this investment, her business will improve due to a stronger physical infrastructure and having capital to invest, making her Kiva loan a successful venture.

She attended school through the fourth grade, when her parents, who did not have much money, found it too hard to keep sending her to school. She grew up, got married, and her two children are now in the 6th and 3rd grade. Her husband is a farmer and together they are working to get their kids ahead.\r\n\r\nElsy learned how to farm as a very young child from her father. When she left school he made her learn it since he thought that it one day might be her main source of income, and so it is, as she is able to meet the needs of her little ones. Her husband also works hard to get the family ahead. He plants corn on a plot about a half a kilometer from their home. This is no burden, though, when it comes to getting a good harvest, even though he has to get up very early to work. The kids also help out and they are learning quite a lot about growing corn. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to prepare the land, buy a bag of seed corn, three sacks of fertilizer, and fungicides.\r\n\r\nElsy's great dream is to get her children ahead and see them have the kind of academic opportunities that she never had. She also wants a good harvest since she hopes to improve her home from their earnings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":411.22,"image":{"id":1732209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable

He believes his business is going to be successful because of his commitment to offer the very best customer service. He is happy to be able to provide a service that makes people\u2019s lives easier.  Before Trinity started his business, he worked as a teller at a Zoona trading booth belonging to Allan. He worked as a teller for two years and because of his good customer service and discipline, his boss Allan connected him to Zoona and helped him set up his own mobile money transfer business. \r\n \r\nRunning a business comes with many challenges. Trinity\u2019s biggest challenge is that he does not have enough cash in his business to meet his customers\u2019 demands. He is requesting a Kiva loan so that he can boost his working capital and serve more customers, therefore becoming more profitable.\r\n\r\nThese funds will ensure that Trinity has enough money to fulfill his customers\u2019 transactions.  This then helps to increase his commissions, which he depends on for his income.  This also makes sure he never has to turn away customers who need his services.  He hopes to expand his business to provide for his family and see his siblings through school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1736333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"To boost his working capital in his mobile money transfer business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Livingstone","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T00:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T00:30:05Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Trinity","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-26T09:04:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":802030,"name":"Wedad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wedad is a 44-year-old married woman.

On Fridays, many travel from all parts of the area either to sell vegetables or animals or to buy their weekly supplies. Unlike the tourist market in Chichicastenango, the one in San Francisco El Alto is for the locals. \r\n\r\nA group of nine enterprising businesswomen have joined together with the goal of improving their standard of living, educating their children, empowering themselves and eliminating poverty. They have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cSan Miguel\u201d and are soliciting a loan from Friendship Bridge, hopefully funded by KIVA investors.\r\n\r\nNicolasa, a widow who is 53 years old and has four children, is part of the Board of Directors of the group. She is a potter and makes ceramic bowls, plates and cups. She works with her children and sells her pottery wholesale (by the dozen) every two weeks. Her ceramic pottery is well known throughout the Western Highlands. In addition, one of her daughters is a seamstress and makes elaborate aprons. Nicolasa is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase clay, wood and other supplies for her ceramic business as well as fabric for the aprons.\r\n\r\nIn funding these much-needed loans, KIVA investors are greatly appreciated by these women.

She is hardworking, cheerful and generous. She currently operates two Zoona mobile money transfer outlets, providing financial services to people in Chipata and Nyimba. Mwila lives with her mother and has the responsibility of supporting her as well as her four siblings.<br \/><br \/>Mwila has been running her mobile money transfer business for two years. She has seen her business grow and is very happy with the progress. This is Mwila\u2019s third loan from Kiva. The first loan she got helped her set up her business. She was able to pay for all her set-up costs and quickly start transacting. She has successfully repaid this loan. <br \/><br \/>Mwila then got a second loan to help her open her second outlet in a small town called Nyimba. With this loan, she was able to purchase a trading booth that she uses to serve her customers who need to send and receive money from her Nyimba outlet.<br \/><br \/>Despite her business doing well, Mwila has some day-to-day challenges that she encounters. She sometimes lacks adequate float to sustain huge money transfer transactions. This then results in fewer commissions being earned. She has also wanted to grow her business by opening up more outlets within the region, but due to lack of capital, this has not yet materialized. <br \/><br \/>Mwila hopes that once she gets the Kiva loan, she will be able to increase her daily float to facilitate bigger payments as well as expand her business by opening up more outlets to reach out to distant communities. This will increase her revenue and help Mwila support her family financially, as it is one of her responsibilities. She is optimistic that very soon she will be able to provide adequate upkeep for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1152293,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2677,"youtubeId":"hnHx2HtHGmg","title":"Kiva Borrower Mwila from Zambia","thumbnailImageId":1152293},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to grow her mobile money transfer business by increasing her daily float to facilitate bigger payments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T08:11:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":802043,"name":"Umar Danjuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Umar Danjuma is a maize farmer from Badamasi village in Kaduna state.
