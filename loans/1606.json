Isah, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to expand his farmland, and hopes to become the most profitable farmer in his community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1636628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for expenses such as food and clothing eliminating the pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":7752,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":7752}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T05:10:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tiffany S.","image":1008207}},{"id":795102,"name":"Opal Amparo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Opal Amparo de 28  a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su familia en su  casa propia, se dedica desde hace 10 a\u00f1os al negocio de venta de ropa americana,  ella vende pantalones, camisas, chores, b\u00f3xer, licras, camisetas, faldas, vestidos, Sandalias, tenis, etc.\nDo\u00f1a Opal Amparo vive en un municipio de Pespire, Choluteca, al sur de Honduras, es una mujer emprendedora con deseos de salir adelante y lucha d\u00eda con d\u00eda para mejorar su calidad de vida. \nDo\u00f1a Opal Amparo est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para compra de 5  fardos  de ropa americana clasificada que incluye blusas, vestidos, faldas, camisas, pantalones, etc. con el apoyo de este pr\u00e9stamo pretende mejorar sus ingresos y tambi\u00e9n su calidad de vida, es un cliente con deseos de trabajar con Prisma.\nSu sue\u00f1o es tener un buen negocio y aumentar su clientela  y al mismo  tiempo mejorar su futuro junto a su familia.\n\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - Octubre del  2014.\n","en":"Se\u00f1ora Opal Amparo, who is 28 years old, lives with her family in her own house.

She lives with her husband and their two children ages 14 and 17. She lives on the south east side of the city, where she sells a wide variety of products. She even offers cell phone call services taking advantage of a large customer pool. She started the business two years ago, encouraged by her sister, who is well known in the neighborhood. This allowed them to develop a business selling jeans, shoes, sweaters, dresses, shorts and cell phone plans, making daily sales and collecting every week, so people could make small payments. She has her own business now, without her sister. She sells on credit, working every day from 7am to 10pm, so she can finally open her own store, where to show her products. Her biggest challenge is to see her children become professionals; they are the driving force for her and her husband. She is currently asking for a her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy footwear and apparel clothing pre-ordered by her customers. She will invest her profits in business improvements, which will translate in better offers to her customers, and thus will prove that her loan was successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1732172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy footwear and apparel clothing pre-ordered by her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T04:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T04:00:07Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":70.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1550000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":157257},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":179025},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":184395},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":189927},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":195625},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":201494},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":207539},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":234738}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.28,"local_amount":157257,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":159411.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.81,"payment_id":595164387},{"amount":82.13,"local_amount":179025,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":181478.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.5,"payment_id":611789280},{"amount":77.07,"local_amount":184395,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":186921.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.15,"payment_id":624849486},{"amount":84.49,"local_amount":189927,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":192529.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.41,"payment_id":636603571},{"amount":91.26,"local_amount":195625,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":198305.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.4,"payment_id":649571779},{"amount":88.44,"local_amount":201494,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":204255.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.06,"payment_id":666497147},{"amount":183.69,"local_amount":442277,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":448337.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.31,"payment_id":681350266}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T17:13:31Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jimena Lopez","image":249667}},{"id":796787,"name":"Ernesto Cristino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ernesto se alista muy de ma\u00f1ana para preparar el negocio de su mama y tambi\u00e9n para asistir a clases, qui\u00e9n un d\u00eda, no muy lejano, podr\u00e1 alzar el birrete y obtener el t\u00edtulo como ingeniero telem\u00e1tico qui\u00e9n  ser\u00e1 capaz de desarrollar sistemas de transmisi\u00f3n y procesamiento de informaci\u00f3n, que permitan aumentar la productividad de las instituciones a las que sirva, de esa manera podr\u00e1 obtener un trabajo digno que ayudara a cubrir a sus necesidades y apoyar a sus padres quienes siempre le han brindado apoyo. \nSin embargo para convertirse en un profesional, Ernesto necesita de herramientas que le ayuden a facilitar su trabajo y de esa manera cumplir con las asignaciones y deberes de la universidad.

Her partner is Edgar and they have two children. She has been employed by a garment factory in Cavite for two years through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nFe supervises the Production Cutting. Before sewing can begin, pattern pieces must be made, layouts determined, and fabric cut. She pays close attention on how the cutters and trimmers take the patterns and cut out material to minimize mistakes.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Fe, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Fe is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.  She looks forward for your positive response and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for the operational expense of her mother-in-law who has an intestinal problem.\r\n\r\nFe hopes to improve the general living condition of her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, quality for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conducts fellowship meeting for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1739931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

She has five children in total; two are single and three are married. To make a living and support her family, she manages and operates a rice farming business in a small farmland which is located near her house. So far, it is more than twenty years that she has been a farmer. On average, she is able to make an earning of USD 5.00 per day.\r\n\r\nSinat wants to have household energy at a reduced monthly cost by purchasing a solar energy home system. Because there is inadequate money, she has requested a Kiva loan through its partner, HKL. After this initial investment, she hopes to have clean energy to power her household lights, TV, and radio. She is very happy and thankful because with this loan, HKL has provided her a special interest rate lower than its general loan rates.

She constructs the pattern and design provided by the garment pattern maker for the pre-production sampling.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Marilisa is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Marilisa is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in returning it back, since the loan payment is being deducted every payday. She looks forward for your positive response and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will also use the loan to pay for the educational expenses of her child.\r\n\r\nMarilisa hopes that there will always be provision for her family in each day, and she prays for guidance and protection for them. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1739981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for the educational expenses of her child.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T05:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T05:40:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536041},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134397},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757165},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200303},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186591},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":1333.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535669}],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T06:02:26Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":802403,"name":"Editha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Editha is a 51-year-old married woman from Sta.

She was born and grew up in a rural area and took care of livestock since her childhood, and helped her parents with the household. Her parents did not have money to teach her and provide her with higher education, and this is why Narziniso, after getting married, continued her parents' business and became involved in animal husbandry.

There are from round palm sized ones to clean cabinets and kitchen counters and large doormats . In the Philippines, rugs are a major item for housekeeping and cleaning, every household has them. Aside from her rug-making, she also sells barbecue for added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 34,000 loan, which she will use to buy additional raw materials like fabric and thread to sew more rugs and doormats. Part of the loan she will use to buy fresh meat and charcoal for her barbecue business. She is thanking God and you for a good return on her investment and for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nRemedios dreams of having a tailoring shop someday. She desires to see her children and grandchildren lead a much better, stable life.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is from Cavite, Philippines and has two children. She is one of the beneficiaries of the employment program of CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nSiony works as an Assistant Production Line Leader. She conducts inspection and tests per a control plan, work instruction and procedures. She maintains good housekeeping at all times at the respective working area. She is also responsible for the group of operators and carries out manpower utilization effectively to meet shipment.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Siony is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that has made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Siony is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying, since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay their electric bill and for the maintenance and renovation of their house.\r\n\r\nSiony dreams to give her family a better life and future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.

She has been employed at a garment factory in Cavite for years, through the help of the CCT Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nGlenda works as a Measurer. She collects and prepares measurements, weights, or identification labels, and attaches them to products.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems for employees like Glenda is the improper balancing of their salaries and family expenses, and they have no access to savings or credit. This is a situation that can leave them heavily indebted to usurious moneylenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Glenda is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying the money since the loan payment is deducted every pay-day. \r\n\r\nShe looks forward to your positive response and any amount from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to buy frozen products that she sells for additional profit.\r\n\r\nGlenda wants her family to be always healthy and happy. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, to provide quality for jobs, to cultivate savings consciousness, and to provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before the start of their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1740029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To purchase frozen products to sell for additional income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glenda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536042},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134398},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757166},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200304},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186592},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535670}],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T23:55:38Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":802497,"name":"Ramo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramo, 38, is an experienced and active farmer.

Since he was a child he helped his father care for the animals and fell in love with this profession. He currently works in the field by purchasing young animals and fattening them for further resale. Animal husbandry is the primary source of income for his family. His wife is a homemaker and helps her husband with the farm, and Sherali also earns a bit of money in his free time offering taxi services with his own car.\r\n\r\nSherali is currently having financial difficulties due to a fall in livestock prices and can't bear to sell his animals for such a low price. He has decided to take out a loan and turned to Arvand for support.

Due to insufficient financial means, he is unable to make maintenance on his taxi. Therefore, Riffat has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Riffat's son can afford the maintenance cost easily and provide better transport facilities to earn profitable income.

Due to insufficient financial means he is unable to perform maintenance on his taxi. Therefore Tahira has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Tahira's husband can afford the maintenance cost easily, and so provide better transportation services to earn a profitable income.

His father taught him how to tend to the crops, poultry, and cattle so that he could get ahead in life. Today he is still a farmer and a poultry farmer. For five years, Morris has been practicing mixed farming. He is very content with the conservative nature of the farming lifestyle. He is appreciative of the fact that farming has enabled him to sustain his family of over the years. On his farm, he keeps dairy animals and grows maize. He also engages in other businesses outside but related to farming to earn additional income. \r\n\r\nMorris requested a loan, which he will use to purchase additional poultry. Like many farmers, he is planning to keep single poultry chickens. From the hens, he will be able to sell meat and eggs to the local hospitality industries. The demand for chicken products in Chuka is always high. With the loan, Morris will be in a position to acquire several chickens and establish his mark in this lucrative space.

This is Kabuye. He is the Director of New Life Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Makindye in Kampala with 286 students. New Life Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

He lives in a rural area and has been involved in raising livestock since his childhood. He started out with two sheep and eventually expanded his livestock to include large cattle. Sherzod\u2019s parents work as seasonal agricultural workers and, when they have time, help their son to take care of the livestock. His parents\u2019 income is barely enough to provide for the family, and thus Sherzod\u2019s business is the main source of income. At present Sherzod\u2019s business does not bring in revenues because the livestock prices have dropped sharply and he lacks the money to buy livestock feed.

She does the sewing and designing of clothing apparel according to the company or client\u2019s demand. She sews clothes using a sewing machine or other stitching machines, or often does hand stitching of edges and linings.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Lalyn, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses. And, they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that made them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Lalyn is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in paying it back since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day.  She looks forward for your positive response, and any coming amount from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan to pay the enrollment fees of her children.\r\n\r\nLalyn hopes to improve the general living condition of her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families.  Its' core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions and spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre and post working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1740239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay the enrollment fees of her kids.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1551.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536047},{"amount":68.76,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3103.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134404},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3103.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757172},{"amount":68.74,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3103.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200310},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1551.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186597}],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T17:56:06Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":802590,"name":"\u0110\u1ed9","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. \u0110\u1ed9 works in agriculture, farming poultry and\u00a0cattle. \u0110\u1ed9 has been involved in this business for more than 10 years.

","en":"Ahrorjon is a young, 26-year-old man, who is married and has 3 children. Ahrorjon lives in a rural area and has been involved in animal husbandry for 13 years. He started this business when he was very young. His father bought him a young bull, and Ahrorjon started to care and feed the bull independently. After raising the bull, he sold him and bought two more young bulls and feed for them. This is how Ahrorjon increased his livestock headcount. Ahrorjon buys young bulls, fattens them up and then sells them at a higher price. This business is Ahrorjon's primary source of income. Because Ahrorjon never obtained a decent education, he wants his children to have a good education and not experience hardships in life like Ahrorjon did.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Violet\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 8.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 9 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1740252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T17:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T17:30:07Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabeti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amaheno","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Japheth","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zipora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zacharia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisheba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barnabas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":140200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T17:21:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":802602,"name":"Justus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justus is 45 years, and married with four children.

He doesn't want to live a life that's not worthy at times due to a low income. \r\n\r\nBarnaba is tired of all this, so he wants to increase his dairy farming. Barnaba has four children whom he adores and cherishes, and a beautiful wife who always paints a smile on Barnaba\u2019s face. \r\n\r\nBarnaba has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years, and is making great strides. He has been able to earn a decent and honest living through milk and egg selling, and personal business. These ventures have enabled him to send his children to school and feed his family. Barnaba has planted many trees on his compound and also has Napier grass, which has high protein and is used to feed his dairy cow, thereby enhancing his milk-selling profits. \r\n\r\nBecause of increased demand, Barnaba is kindly requesting a loan to buy a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is a very profitable venture, and he wants to take full advantage of the ready market for dairy products. Through the loan, Barnaba is sure of satisfying the demand for milk in his area. Through increased profits, Barnaba is sure that he will repay the loan on time, and also be in a position to comfortably take care of his family. \r\n\r\nBarnaba, with his entrepreneurial spirit, strength and tenacity, would like to continue fighting so that he can achieve his dream of owning his own business and empowering society by being a source of employment. Juhudi Kilimo, through its training, has helped Barnaba save more effectively, and through his accumulated profits, he plans to add value to his milk through packaging. \r\n\r\nHe also hopes to one day start manufacturing milk products such as yogurt and cream.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":229.06,"image":{"id":1740267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

is a resident of Cavite, Philippines. She has children and she is working in a garment factory. She was employed through the assistance of Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nRuby is a Roving Quality Control Officer. She inspects garments, such as men's denim bottoms, during manufacturing operations to determine the number of defects per worker and reasons for rejects by examiners. She counts the number of pattern parts, layers of cloth prior to cutting, number of stitches per inch during sewing operations, and collects other measurement knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees, like Ruby, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who captured their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Ruby is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were deducted every payday. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will be using the loan as her additional capital for her direct-selling business.\r\n\r\nRuby wants to be promoted to supervisor someday or become a successful businesswoman. She dreams of giving her children a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects.  The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, provide quality jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring, and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, empowering the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1740275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to create starting capital for her direct-selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carmona, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.26,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T11:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2539.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579536048},{"amount":56.26,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2539.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134405},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2539.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757173},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2539,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200311}],"funded_date":"2014-11-25T18:33:47Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":802614,"name":"M\u00f9i","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M\u00f9i has a retail business selling\u00a0animal feed.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.<br \/><br \/>With this loan, Pamela\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 7 acres of land and purchase a total of 11 solar lights."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1740286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Masilina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harun","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noel Felistus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mebo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agneta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mebo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":116330,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116330}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-26T15:08:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":802634,"name":"Rihab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rihab is 31 years old and single.

She counts the number of pattern parts, layers of cloth prior to cutting, number of stitches per inch during sewing operations and collects other measurement knowledge.<br \/><br \/>One of the main dilemmas of employees like Analyn, is the improper balancing of their salaries with family expenses and they have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, Analyn is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying them since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will be incorporating her loan to the capital needed in making peanut butter.<br \/><br \/>Analyn dreams of becoming a successful businesswoman.

Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.<br \/><br \/>** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine.

Su vida la realiza con su esposo que se dedica a la agricultura y su hija que se encuentra en tercer semestre de la universidad, viven en una casa propia de ladrillo y cuentan con agua de pozo y electricidad. La necesidad de trabajar constantemente la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; tienda de barrio, carnicer\u00eda,  venta de s\u00e1ndwiches, venta de empanadas, agricultura, venta de refrescos y librer\u00eda para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y prosperar en sus negocios.

Gracias a sus valores nutricionales y medicinales, masticar hojas de coca o beber mate de coca contin\u00faa siendo de vital importancia para mantener la salud de millones de personas. Una de las razones de esto es que las hojas de coca contienen m\u00e1s minerales, prote\u00ednas y vitaminas que muchos de los cultivos alimentarios en los Andes.

La preparaci\u00f3n de tierras es un componente esencial en el proceso de establecimiento y desarrollo de los cultivos, y al mismo tiempo es parte vital en el manejo integrado de plagas y enfermedades. Esta es la primera secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 15 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Arminda solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la preparaci\u00f3n de la tierra para el cultivo.","en":"Arminda is 42 years, married and has a 19 year old daughter.

Thanks to their nutritional and medicinal value people chew coca leaves or drink coca tea, This is of vital importance in maintaining the health of millions of people. One of the reasons is that coca leaves contain more minerals, vitamins and proteins than many of the foods in the Andes. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to increase her agricultural production. She wants to prepare the land for production that is clear and turn the land in a process that requires traction, animal or mechanical. Then she needs to break up the soil with the help of a plow. Preparing the land is an essential step in the process of developing and growing of plants. At the same time it is  a vital component of infestation control.

He has been able to earn a decent income. He loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his dairy cows. He loves milking and feeding his cow which is his hobby. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is very fulfilling to Leonard.

They all live in Daoudabougou, a neighbourhood in Bamako, and know each other through their businesses, and being relations and neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group sell charcoal, firewood and cereals. In order to increase their stock, they have decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and this is their first solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nSocona (pictured on the far left) is a renowned seller of charcoal and firewood. She will use her loan to buy one load of charcoal and firewood, which she usually gets from the villages around Bamako and resells for cash or on credit, and sometimes to order, to a mostly female clientele.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Socona hopes to make 30,000 CFA francs per month on average, which will be used to pay her children's healthcare costs. She would like to expand her business in partnership with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1737099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy charcoal and firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T19:30:11Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":30.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Socona                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Astan                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saly             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":233333.34,"processed_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":236643.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595319290},{"amount":225,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":118321.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610753052},{"amount":208.28,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T13:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":118321.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.72,"payment_id":624542785},{"amount":211,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":118321.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14,"payment_id":636515804},{"amount":225,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-28T12:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":118321.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649788070}],"funded_date":"2014-12-03T17:39:37Z","paid_date":"2015-05-28T12:14:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lucy  Knight","image":null}},{"id":802670,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard lives in Hoima, Uganda.
