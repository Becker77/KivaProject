He sells poultry meat and eggs to his neighbors and to the local market. Because he produces quality meat and eggs, he has seen an influx of customers who want to buy from him. He is overwhelmed with the demand and cannot fully satisfy it. He is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry so that he can fully satisfy the demand, and this will immediately translate to more income.\r\n\r\nIncome from selling eggs and meat will be used to improve his living conditions, cope with rising farm expenses, and secure the future of his school-going children. Other than an increase in profits, he will also make extra cash by selling poultry feathers, which are used in making earrings. He will also benefit from having more poultry manure, which will increase the fertility levels of his

She gets the best feed and medical care Dancan can provide. However, his biggest challenge is raising capital. \r\n\r\nDancan has a sound investment plan that will push him to the next level. He is seeking a loan through Kiva to purchase a water tank. Constant availability of water at his homestead will make work very easy for him. His farm animals and poultry will have a constant flow of drinking water, his family will have water for domestic use at the doorstep, and the crops on the farm will grow green and healthy through irrigation. \r\n\r\nDancan wants to harvest rain water that always goes to waste and store it in the water tank for future use. With your contribution, Dancan will seek to increase the number of animals on his farm because his animals will no longer have the challenge of no drinking water. This loan will improve his living conditions and he will secure the future of his child."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1740448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a water tank","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T20:30:08Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.48,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dancan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.97,"local_amount":1863.62,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194772},{"amount":33.29,"local_amount":2959.06,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2996.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824213},{"amount":17.51,"local_amount":1556.44,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1575.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264636},{"amount":18.17,"local_amount":1615.2,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1635.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600889},{"amount":18.16,"local_amount":1614.05,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1634.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459307},{"amount":18.93,"local_amount":1726.68,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1748.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.5,"payment_id":681377747},{"amount":18.56,"local_amount":1704.56,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1725.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.62,"payment_id":696587401},{"amount":19.21,"local_amount":1816.92,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1839.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.23,"payment_id":711505736},{"amount":20.12,"local_amount":1864.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1888.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.86,"payment_id":731022526},{"amount":35.6,"local_amount":3278.76,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3319.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.27,"payment_id":752110775}],"funded_date":"2014-11-26T07:04:12Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":802718,"name":"Tigran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tigran is 44 years old and he lives with his pretty wife and beloved children in Kadjaran city of Syunik region.

As I have taken English and math classes at Continuing Education Center of AUCA, I am familiar with its teaching methods and quality of education. The flexibility, the modern approach, the quality of the education can compete with leading universities of the West. These reasons urged me on entering AUCA.\r\n\r\nI live with my grandmother, as my mother works in another city, where she can earn much money than here. My grandmother is a pensioner, so both of us depend on my mother\u2019s salary. My mother is doing her best to save money for my tuition, but upset that she can\u2019t pay it by herself. I thank Kiva lenders for their attention and kindly ask to help

is a young woman, 29 years old, from a small village in Chaladidi, Khobi district. She has a 12-member family, and they don't have any significant income for existence. The family belongs to the subsistence poor category and lives under poverty. The family members get social assistance from the local government. Apart of this, they have a small agricultural activity.  Particularly, they own a milk cow, and pigs, and they sell cheese and grown pigs at the local market. \r\n\r\nTeona has a great desire to do her bit for her family's welfare, and to somehow increase the income. To realize her plans she requires financial support and has obtained credit to local financial institutions. Teona requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provision for business start-ups and restart-up credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, and lack of access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, she will start trading in seasonal fruits and vegetables. Her husband will also help her. They will purchase fruits and vegetables from local farmers at wholesale prices, and sell them in nearby towns with a price markup. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income. Their income will double, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1740471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to start a trading business with fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Chaladidi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2014-11-25T21:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-09T21:20:07Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":85.42,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":65.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":79.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":81.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":90.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":93.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":99.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":109.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.34,"local_amount":65.71,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-22T10:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595206554},{"amount":43.45,"local_amount":79.35,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":80.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.63,"payment_id":610601896},{"amount":41.89,"local_amount":81.93,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.66,"payment_id":624876096},{"amount":43.48,"local_amount":87.33,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":88.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.14,"payment_id":636277171},{"amount":41.28,"local_amount":87.42,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":88.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.39,"payment_id":649613185},{"amount":45.43,"local_amount":90.99,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":92.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.27,"payment_id":665092922},{"amount":46.02,"local_amount":93.21,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":94.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.94,"payment_id":681390693},{"amount":46.62,"local_amount":96.77,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":98.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.36,"payment_id":696601005},{"amount":194.07,"local_amount":417.29,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":423.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":43.03,"payment_id":711520365}],"funded_date":"2014-12-01T22:36:36Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T16:15:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":802795,"name":"Fatima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima is a married woman with four children.

Unfortunately, her business suffered a huge setback when heavy rains destroyed her fowl run. To avoid further setbacks, she has been keeping the chickens she bought with the rest of the loan in one of the rooms in her house which has very little carrying capacity. With some of the proceeds, Nohlahla decided to diversify her business and begin selling groceries. Aside from heavy rains, other challenges Nohlahla has faced include newcastle disease, which affects poultry, a high transport costs due to a poor road network and irregular currency exchange rates. Overall, the business has been going well for Nohlahla and she is getting profits ranging from $100-$150 from both her poultry business and her grocery business. With her profits, Nohlahla is completing her secondary education. She is currently a certified early child development teacher as well.

They average 43 years of age and three children.

Their commercial activities include the sale of plastic shoes, cooked fonio, and millet flour.   \r\n\r\nTo build their inventory, the group members joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. This is their 3rd group loan cycle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Aby (sitting at the far left in the group photo) is a leading restaurant worker.

He grew up in a poor family, where his parents worked in the field all day in order to feed the family. Farruh was not able to get a decent education due to the family's financial problems. \r\n\r\nAfter having finished school, Farruh went to Russia as a migrant worker. When he had earned some money he went home and purchased some livestock, and started to breed them for reselling. This way he was able to increase the number of livestock and get a larger income. \r\n\r\nFarruh would like to give his children the possibility to get a decent education, so they will not suffer in life, like their parents. Currently Farruh has financial problems due to the decline in livestock prices. He decided to turn to \"Arvand\" with this problem, and take a loan. For the money he receives, Farruh would like to purchase livestock fodder.

He is married and has three children. Abdullojon was born and grew up in a village, and as his parents were poor, he was not able to get a full education. \r\n\r\nAbdullojon went to Russia as a migrant worker and after having saved up money, he decided to work with livestock breeding. In the beginning, he purchased two rams and started breeding them. After having fattened them, he sold them and purchased five young lambs. \r\n\r\nCurrently Abdullojon has twenty rams, however due to the fall in livestock prices, he is going through hard times. He decided to turn to \"Arvand\" for help, as \"Arvand\" offers loans to livestock breeding businesses. He was very delighted by this. For the money received, Abdullojon would like to stock up livestock fodder for the whole winter.

Sherali is married and has two dependent children. He lives in the countryside and is engaged in petty retail in a shop which is located near his home. Sherali's parents are involved in agriculture and they grow cereals. Sherali himself since childhood has helped his parents in the field and he was not able to get a sufficient education since his parents did not have the opportunity to give him an education. <br \/><br \/>Now Sherali has gone into business and having saved money decided to build himself a home, since his family has three sons and he as the eldest must leave the parental home. Sherali will be able to build a home but he does not have enough money to install windows and doors. With the loan amount, he wants to purchase windows and doors. With this problem, he applied to Arvand for support in order to finish the construction before the approaching cold.

He is a purposeful and hardworking man. He has a large, friendly family, where everyone tries to support each other. As the head of the family, Mamurjon strives to do everything in order for his family to not be in need of anything. You can call him a jack of all trades; as he is a master carpenter, he understands all the intricacies of construction. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Mamurjon is preparing his house for the winter cold by insulating the house. His knowledge of construction and renovation of houses certainly saves money as he does not have to hire carpenters; he can do all the work himself.

She resides in the Yavan region. Gulsunoy is married and raised two sons. Her children are working aborad in Russia. Her husband works as a security guard in a company that produces windows. For many years, she works in the state structure. In all of their free time, Gulsunoy and her busband work the land. Their ancestors were farmers, and they too will work the land.

He has a lovely family. Vadim has a wife and two daughters. \r\n\r\nHis wife is a housewife and helps Vadim in his business. His elder daughter goes to sixth class in school, and his little daughter is going to second class in school. The family members are IDP (Internally Dsplaced Persons) from Fuzuli city and now live in the Fuzuli region. \r\n\r\nVadim has been in the animal breeding business for 5 years.

At a young age, she learned how to make clothes on her own.  However, she felt the need to become a professional in this art.  For this reason, she studied at an academy before starting her own business in 1984.  <br \/><br \/>Eludys is 52 years old and has been dedicated to this business for 30 years.  She is married and has three children:  two daughters (ages 21 and 14) and a son (age 23).  Her long-term goals include improving the conditions of the house in which her family lives.  For this reason, Sra. Eludys works at her shop for nine hours each day so that she can fulfill orders from her customers.  She produces all types of clothing such as shirts, trousers, dresses, school uniforms, and other garments.  Eludys handles every step of the operation, including sewing, designing, cutting fabric, prepping, assembly, finishing individual pieces, and packaging the product.  Her customers have remained loyal over time because Eludys provides excellent service.  The clothes that she produces are custom-fitted and on the cutting edge.  <br \/><br \/>Due to the wide range of products that she offers and the demand for her services, Eludys decided that her business should grow much more.  For this reason, she will invest in an industrial overlock stitching machine and raw materials that she will purchase in bulk and with cash.  These items include fabrics, thread, and buttons.  In order to strengthen her infrastructure, her production capacity, and her operating capital, Eludys is applying for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will invest the proceeds as planned.  <br \/><br \/>By improving her business and increasing her productivity, Eludys will be able to produce a quality finished product.  In addition to expanding, her greatest challenge will be having sufficient operating capital for investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":1728308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

The Nkubu area has a cool climate, but sometimes experiences long dry spells, and this account for major crop failures which can lead to starvation. \r\n\r\nLawrence is seeking a loan to purchase a high quality dairy cow. Easy availability of feed and fodder all year round makes dairy farming an ideal choice of investment in this region. Through the loan Lawrence will be able to fully satisfy the demand for milk in his village and through increased income, he will be able to improve his living conditions. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be very important because it will not only improve Lawrence\u2019s life, but also he will be able to get manure, which will be used on his farm and improve productivity. \r\n\r\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, Lawrence has been trained on how to save money, and he plans to use the extra income to increase his business and is planning to buy another dairy cow.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Margaret\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land and purchase a total of eight solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-26T00:40:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-10T00:40:41Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mable","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bramwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100250,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T18:53:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":802836,"name":"Judith's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith, pictured above, has been a farmer for 18 years, and is now proud to represent her group of 16 farmers in Kakamega South District.

He has been a solar lamp distributor for NOTS Lampe Solaire for the past 3 years. Last year Daniel used Kiva funds to purchase solar lamp inventory worth $20,275. He successfully paid back his Kiva loan and now hopes to increase the loan size so he can purchase 2,500 solar lamps from NOTS Lampes Solaire and sell them to cotton farmers on credit. Prior to selling solar lamps, Daniel studied agriculture and engineering and worked as a farm manager at a Malian textile company. He started his own company because he believes that solar lamps are very useful for rural families who live in his region. Daniel\u2019s main customers are farmers from Sikasso, the southern-most region in Mali. The majority of his customers do not have access to electricity - they light their homes with kerosene, flashlights and candles instead. To charge their mobile phones they walk long distances to a kiosk and pay money. On top of being dangerous, time-consuming and toxic, these energy sources are expensive. They cost a family about $80 per year or 10% of their annual income! And during the rainy season it is even worse, as kerosene is oftentimes not available or very expensive. A d.light solar lamp lasts for about 5 years and costs $25. Purchasing a solar lamp saves families time and money (about $375 over 5 years!) and is much safer and healthier. The environment also benefits \u2013 no more toxic waste or dirty CO2 emissions. Daniel recently signed an agreement with the Union of Cotton Producer Cooperatives to promote solar lamps to the 15,000 cotton farmers in his region.

Her business is selling candy. She is a good mother, enterprising, constant, responsible, and hard-working. Her business is located in the \"16 de julio\" zone, an area known for all kinds of businesses and its traditional market that takes place every Thursday and Sunday. In the market you can find everything from sewing needles to tractors. The area has a cold, dry climate with a constant temperature of 4-12 degrees centigrade all year.<br \/><br \/>Rosa has a dark complexion, long dark hair, medium height, and her first language is Aymara and her second language Spanish. She is seated third from the right with the black jacket. She lives with her two children. The oldest studies at the university and the youngest in kindergarten. The family lives in its own home with drinkable water, electricity, and natural gas. The need for income to cover her household expenses drove Rosa to form a communal bank with others. They have businesses such as: selling food, refreshments, sweaters, making baby clothing, selling french fries, athletic clothing, neighborhood store, and butcher shop. The loan will be used to support their businesses.<br \/><br \/>Rosa sells candy such as sandwich cookies, tarts, gum, lollipops, chocolate, caramels, etc.  Thanks to her desire to be self-sufficient she began this business. She has had her business for 8 years, selling from the doorway of her home in all kinds of weather and cold.  The advantage is that on Thursdays and Sundays the famous traditional \"16 de julio\" market has many sales.<br \/><br \/>Her dream is to open a space in her home to open a store and sell from her home.

Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a big, happy and friendly family. I am the second of three. My sister studies at another research university and my little brother started primary school this year. I finished Physics and Mathematics Lyceum #61, which is one of the most prestigious schools in Kyrgyzstan, and am eager to study at AUCA. With AUCA, I can be on the move and look confidently to my future as it provides its students up-to-date conditions for learning and development. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s common that tuition at the best universities is high, and AUCA is not an exception. My father\u2019s salary and our savings are not enough to cover my and my sister\u2019s tuition fees.  We understand that it\u2019s better to try to get a good education now, which will help us to find well-paid job in the future than 'to boil the pot' without higher education. In dreams we live, in dreams we act, but we reach our goals after them. This Kiva loan is a huge and key step in making my dreams a reality.\u201d

As the key breadwinner of his family, with a wife and three children, he farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kerugoya in the Central region of Kenya. For the past 15 years, he has been practicing mixed farming. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs and crop selling. He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. Stanley passionately loves dairy farming. The biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. \r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter and another quality breed of dairy cow. The chaff cutter will assist Stanley in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to feed his cows. Also, it will aid the animals' digestion and prevent the animals from rejecting any part of their food. Stanley also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be produce between 15 and 25 liters of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 KES per liter, and with this loan, he would make a cool US $11 per day. \r\n\r\nBefore Stanley joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have any future promise for income generation. After training, Stanley now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the millionaires' club. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Stanley will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows, and through this loan, Stanley will achieve this. An increase in income will allow Stanley to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Stanley fears that his dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide its reliable market channel, credit facility, and services that he requires to grow his dairy enterprise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1740613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is 69 years old and happily married with 5 children. All of his children are working now, except his youngest who is presently attending a teacher's training college. His other 4 children are also farmers. John lives with his wife in Abura Enyinabrim in the Central Region of Ghana. \r\n\r\nJohn has been a farmer for 28 years. His farm is at two different locations. The first site is where he has an orange, cocoa and oil palm plantation, and on the second farm he grows cassava, plantain and cocoyam (taro, a root crop). He earns his entire living from his farming activities. John and the rest of his group members belong to the locally-registered Citrus Farmers Association that coordinates the marketing and capacity building of their members. John is finding it difficult to obtain a micro loan locally to finance the cost of maintaining his farms. He used to maintain the farms alone during his prime years; however, as he ages, his physical strength cannot cope with the maintenance demands. A micro-loan will help John to hire labourers to weed the farm, and buy fertilizer and food fly traps. The loan will help John to increase his profit significantly, and his profits will far exceed the loan he needs to invest in his farms now.

Najiyu, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to expand his farmland, and hopes to become the most profitable farmer in his community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1627694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to meet expenses like food and clothing by eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-26T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-10T04:30:04Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Najiyu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10539,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10539}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-26T20:57:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jim Brule","image":840348}},{"id":800382,"name":"Karim","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nMonsieur KARIM  est n\u00e9 vers 1971 \u00e0 MASSAKANA, p\u00e8re de 5 enfants, mari\u00e9 et il r\u00e9side chez lui-m\u00eame avec son \u00e9pouse dans une famille traditionnelle \u00e0 BANCONI un quartier populaire de la ville de Sikasso 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du MALI. \nMonsieur KARIM m\u00e8ne des activit\u00e9s d\u2019achat et de vente des pneus et des jantes  il ya plus de 10 ans, il s'approvisionne \u00e0 BAMAKO.\n Il est \u00e0 son troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat  individuel avec l\u2019Institution de micro-finance Soro Yiriwaso dans le souci de mieux satisfaire sa client\u00e8le de plus en plus croissante.  \nCe pr\u00eat lui permettra de faire l\u2019achat de 30 pneus de v\u00e9lo de marque diff\u00e9rentes et 30 jantes de v\u00e9lo pour la revendre en d\u00e9tail au march\u00e9 \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019homme et de femme au comptant et \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit.\n Il envisage r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mensuel moyen de 120 000 francs CFA.

Husan is a member of a large family and lives with his parents. Husan has to work all day to provide for his family. Husan's mother works as a milkmaid on a cattle farm. His father works as a laborer on a private building site. Husan did not finish his secondary education since his parents were not able to provide him with a decent education. Husan is the oldest child in the family and, seeing how hard parents have to work to provide for his family, he decided to keep livestock. Husan has been doing this for three years. Husan started small, with only one sheep. Husan gradually increased the number of cattle to two cows and four sheep. Now, Husan's business is the main source of income for the family. Husan wants his younger brothers to receive a good education and not suffer in life as his parents have. Currently, because there has been a decline in cattle prices, Husan has had financial problems. Husan decided to take out a loan and thus approached Arvand. With the money, Husan wants to buy fodder and a couple of lambs. Husan would like to thank Arvand in advance for providing banking services for the poor."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":629.6,"image":{"id":1737022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle and cattle feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

Therefore, she is asking for a new loan that she will use to buy additional thread for her textiles and acquire a calf. \r\n\r\nLike Juana, all of the businesswomen in the group appreciate the assistance of the Kiva investors in helping the women find a \u201clight\u201d that allows the women to improve their own lives as well as those of their families. Thank you Kiva for contributing to a very important

This 40 year-old motivated businesswoman is married to a bricklayer, with whom she has seven children between the ages of 18 months and 18 years. Santos has sold chicken for a while but demand has increased and she recognizes the necessity of access to credit. In addition, Santos and her family are weavers. They receive requests from textile vendors, especially during this time of year as new year parties approach. Therefore, Santos is requesting a new loan with which she plans to increase her inventory of chicken, as well as buy a new sewing machine. Santos is excited to generate more income through her businesses in order to continue providing better nutrition and education for her children. \r\n\r\nThe hope of the women of the Trust Bank \u201cUnited Women from Chisac\u201d is to provide a better future for their children, giving them the opportunity to develop intellectually in local schools. In order to do this, the women must work hard to be able to afford the costs associated with education. \r\n\r\nThe women are truly grateful for receiving a new loan that will benefit themselves as well as their families.

Also, she has been involved in agriculture since 2001 to provide additional income. She has 4 cows, 10 sheep and also grows rice on 1.0 hectare of leased land. Her monthly combined business profit amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). Shayirgul decided to insulate her house by installing plastic doors. This is why she requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy plastic windows because they do not let the cold in. Shayirgul will be able to insulate her house and provide safety for her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1739244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to purchase energy efficient plastic windows in order to be more secure and conserve energy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Dyikan village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-11-26T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-10T07:00:01Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.49,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shayirgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3929},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3654},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3761},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3871},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3983},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4100},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4219},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4342},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4469},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4599},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4733},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4340}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":132.71,"local_amount":7583,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7643.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436642},{"amount":65.82,"local_amount":3761,"processed_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3791.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751625},{"amount":67.74,"local_amount":3871,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3901.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799338},{"amount":69.21,"local_amount":3983,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4014.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.49,"payment_id":636161487},{"amount":71.75,"local_amount":4100,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4132.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513885},{"amount":73.83,"local_amount":4219,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4252.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995649},{"amount":75.98,"local_amount":4342,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4376.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291045},{"amount":317.47,"local_amount":18141,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":18286.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500277}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T15:26:34Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":803203,"name":"Felomina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Felomina works hard to support her family.<br \/><br \/>She has a fishing business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from fish vending.

Thanks to Zhanylkan's persistence, drive and hard work, today she has 1 dairy cow and 1 horse. She sells milk on a daily basis. She also has 0.60 hectares of land, where Zhanylkan grows potatoes. Zhanylkan's and her family's combined monthly income amounts to about 15,000 som (KGS). This money is not enough for a decent life for Zhanylkan and her family, and this is why she requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 1 horse.
