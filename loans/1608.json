Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby, and the people in the community. She earns PHP 1,000 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

She describes herself as obedient. She operates a retail business where she sells medicine and cosmetics. She has been involved in this business for eight years. Her business is located in a viable location and her primary customers are locals. She describes her biggest business challenge to be lack of enough capital to expand her business.

In addition, the female artisans travel everyday to Kandahar Treasure by foot. Not only does this take hours out of their workday, but it also can be very unsafe. The loan will also be used to provide transportation which will allow for improved safety and more quality hours of production time.  \n\nKandahar Treasure has increasing market opportunities both inside Afghanistan as well as internationally and the business continues to grow. The success of Kandahar Treasure is a great example to the world that women in one of the world's most dangerous parts can achieve self-sufficiency with a traditional skill of creativity. Hopefully it can serve as inspiration for the rest of the world, where life might not be as harsh and as unstable as Kandahar, to be able to succeed in many projects.

She went from selling sodas and snacks to setting up a complete grocery store.  Since her last loan, she managed to buy more products to diversify her business.  She's very grateful to all the people who gave her a hand.\r\n\r\nNow Wendy's little grocery store is almost two years old.  She has the help of her mother, who manages the business when Wendy's working as a teacher in a private school.\r\n\r\nWendy wants to keep on investing in her business because she's a woman with a great desire for self-improvement.

She is single and has her own business to support herself and help her aging parents. \r\n\r\nMargaret has operated a general store for five years already. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. \r\n\r\nMargaret earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells popular brands of direct-selling products. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, Margaret is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan, which she will use to buy grocery items, such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, and direct-selling beauty products, as well. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nMargaret hopes to maintain and grow her business. She dreams of going abroad to earn more money and invest her income in other businesses, so she could support her parents in their old age. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1740334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She works in the Plan 3000 zone, a place characterized by tremendous growth in population due to the arrival of nomadic tribes from the east (Ayoreos) and relocated miners from the west. It has a warm, tropical climate with temperatures that vary from 27 to 32 degrees centigrade year round. Shirley has a dark complexion, is of medium height, and has long, black, braided hair. Her mother tongue is Guarani and she learned Spanish in the city. She has no life partner and lives in her grandmother's house with her four children.  The eldest goes to school. The house is made of brick and has running water and electricity. \r\n\r\nShe sells typical foods at different times of the day. In the morning she sells humintas (a type of tamale - ground corn with cheese wrapped in its husk); at noontime she sells masaco (crushed yucca with cheese formed into balls); and at night she prepares the ingredients for the next day's meals. She sells out of her house so she can sell the food hot for take out or to eat on the run. \r\n\r\nShe has been running this business for two years but this is her first loan sequence with the lender. She dreams of having her own business and would like to expand her business by buying a refrigerator to store her perishable foods. This will give her more time to sell other foods at night. In this way she will be able to increase her income and pay her children's expenses more easily.

She has a vegetable selling business. \r\nShe is a good mother, independent, reliable, responsible and hardworking. She carries out her occupation in the area 'cruce villa Adela', a location characterized by its connection to several areas of the city through public transport. From this location it is possible to reach the el Alto region, far from the city, of a cold and dry climate with a constant year-round temperature between 4 and 12 degrees and an altitude of 3800 meters over sea level. \r\nJacinta is of darker complexion, medium height, has long black hair, and her mother tongue is aymara, which she uses with her family when she is working. In her business she speaks Spanish (she walks into the center of town, wearing a black sweater). She leads her life with her spouse, who works in construction, and her daughters; the older one studies to become a secretary, the middle one goes to school and the smallest one is starting kindergarten. They live in the house of her mother-in-law, which is made from bricks and has drinking water, electricity and gas. The need to improve her business led her to join a bank of people with businesses such as dressmaking shops, the production of empanadas, the sale of cosmetics, the sale of jackets, the sale of aprons, the sale of alpaca sweaters, and the sale of skirts, in order to request a loan and improve her business activities. She sells vegetables such as cauliflower, carrots, salad, squash etc. on a daily basis in the market of the area. The advantage of her business is that her products sell out daily and she receives a daily income; the disadvantage is that she has much competition. She dreams of building her house on a plot of land that she bought and that she is still paying off. She wishes to buy her vegetables in bulk to distribute them to resellers and to sell them in wholesale and retail settings. This is the first series of loans with the institution in the 5 years she has been doing this work. This is why Jacinta requests a loan for the purchase of vegetables in bulk to sell in wholesale and retail settings.
