Beside this, she owns a small cassava farmland which she manages and operates, farming seasonally. \r\n\r\nIn this farming season, she is going to use natural fertilizers in her farmland. Because there is a shortage of money, she would like to get a Kiva loan via KHL to buy fertilizers to use in her farming process. With the support from this loan, she hopes that it can make her cassava growing better and produce more crops for her.

This city is known for its beautiful beaches that are visited year-round, and for being a city of unequalled beauty with many tourist attractions. Martha lives here. She is 60 years old and married, with four grown children. Her husband is a driver. Martha works selling clothing, shoes and purses door-to-door. She sells to her customers on credit, and collects payment weekly. On weekends she makes and sells delicious onion-seasoned fish from her house. She has done this work for more than 5 years, and enjoys doing it. She is repeating the loan request, because thanks to previous loans she has been able to grow her business each time.

old, a widow, and the mother of four children. Asila has a secondary education. She has worked in agriculture for ten years. Her farm has two cows and eighteen sheep, and a plot of land measuring 1.02 hectares where Asila grows corn, sunflowers and potatoes. Her children happily assist Asila with her business. She has everything necessary for livestock. Additionally, she works sewing. Asila's monthly income is about 10,000 KGS. However, this income is not enough for a decent life, especially because Asila wants to help her children and grandchildren. She is full of energy and decided to develop their business. Therefore, she appealed to the bank Bai -Tushum for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cows.

She has a high school education. Since 1994 she has farmed and raised livestock. Through Gulnara's hard work she now has a well-developed farm. She rents 0.20 hectares of irrigated land where Gulnara grows garlic and potatoes. Her farm also has two cows and two bulls. Every day she sells environmentally friendly, homemade, very tasty milk. Her average monthly income is about 8,000 som KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Gulnara turned to the bank Bai-Tushum for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase a dairy cow. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further expanding her business, which will then improve her family's living conditions and then she can save money for her son's wedding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1741177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase one dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhon-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-11-27T04:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-11T04:20:08Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":104.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":770.26,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50370.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":104.74,"payment_id":752025524}],"funded_date":"2014-12-24T16:38:56Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":803793,"name":"Nida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nida works hard to support her family.

Ferry wants to be able to complete the program of study, but he was concerned about the cost of his study. Ferry's parents work in open food stalls in the area and their income is not very much, so it is hard to finance his studies. Ferry was the first child of two siblings. With their minimal economic circumstances, Ferry did not want to be a burden on his parents. With the Kiva program in AMN, Ferry applied for student loans so that he can continue his schooling. Ferry desires to be able to work on a ship as a ship's tekniksi professional, because he has had this dream for a long time. Hopefully with a loan from Kiva, Ferry can help ease the burden on parents.

She lives with her parents.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a young woman looking for a way to give her children the best. She has a small boat that her father uses to work. He transports people and cargo from the fishing boats to the city's nice beaches. This means of transportation is very popular and there are few people offering this service, so business is going very well for them. It allows them to earn their daily living and support her children and her parents.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy fuel and repair the boat in order to offer better services. This is her second cycle with her communal bank and she likes it because the help she gets from these loans allows her to provide for her family. Her goal is to provide for her children as best she can.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1734250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy fuel and repair her boat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-11-27T07:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-11T07:40:20Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":978.12,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.68,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-12-17T12:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":166.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":579565459},{"amount":166.68,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":166.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595162699},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785438},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232175},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636217944},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569654}],"funded_date":"2014-11-27T15:47:26Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Sanchis","image":null}},{"id":798247,"name":"Eugenio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenio tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene hogar estable al lado de sus hijos, vive en casa propia de material rustico de un piso ubicada el Caserio La Granadilla en el distrito Santo Tomas, Eugenio es nacido en el Caserio antes mencionado, el cual pertenece al distrito Santo Tomas,  provincia de Cutervo, regi\u00f3n de Cajamarca, sierra norte de Per\u00fa.

Apart from receiving farming inputs, he is also purchasing a solar light as part of his loan, which is very exciting to him as he will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits that he gains from this year\u2019s harvest, he plans to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nIsaiah and his group will receive a total of 17 solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 6.5 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1741997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-27T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-11T15:30:04Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mandira","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin M","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene M","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":132490,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132490}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T08:40:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":803917,"name":"Heng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a rural area in Kampong Speu province, Heng is 52 years old and a mother of seven children.

He inherited his business \u2013 making and selling cheese \u2013 from his relatives. He works on this activity every day of the week, and he also is in charge of carrying out sales. He transports all of his products to the closest city to leave them in the neighborhood stores. \r\n\r\nCheese production varies depending on the amount of milk. As a good producer, he travels to other producers\u2019 farms to buy milk. He says, \u201cMany times my cattle do not produce enough milk, due to the cold and scarce fodder. Because of this, I go to other communities to buy milk, bringing it back in large cans.\u201d \r\n\r\nHis wish is to improve his family\u2019s quality of life, and to expand his business by buying a vehicle. This will allow him to buy and transport milk from other communities, and also to transport his cheese products to the city. This is the first loan that he has requested with the institution in the three years that he has been in this occupation.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Waldo is requesting a loan to buy a vehicle to

Zablon also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to have an overall improved quality of life.<br \/><br \/>Obtaining this loan means that Zablon's Group will be able to receive a total of nine solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of eight acres."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1742118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-27T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-11T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zablon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos S","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon T","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malova","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene K","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madrose N","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":133840,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133840}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T16:14:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":804043,"name":"Mellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders, meet Mellen.
