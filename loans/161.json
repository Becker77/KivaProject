He worked for a boss who had the idea to work on foot and sell shoes in the local pueblos. After breaking off from this small business, Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, and they followed a similar model from Victor\u2019s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly whichi towns were the most lucrative, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally. Each day they work from 5am until 10pm. They have recently been so focused on sales that they have not had the time to replenish their inventory with new stock, so they sell goods in the morning and then use the proceeds from those sales to buy just enough shoes to still sell in the afternoon. Victor\u2019s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically goes to the small towns and local festivals which occur fairly often. They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained strong over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. \r\n\r\nVictor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.  He is a 48 year-old with four children, who of whom work for the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children.

They live in the municipality of Obraje, which is in the city of Chinandega in Nicaragua. <p>\r\n\r\nA problem that Donald encounters is the lack of electric energy in his area since it is very far from the city. For this reason, he uses candles in the evenings but they only light up a small part of his home.  To fix this situation, Donald has borrowed loans from Ceprodel to buy a solar panel.  In this way, he can light up his home and have access to television for his family. <p>\r\n\r\nHis greatest need is to pay off the debt used to buy a solar panel so he can continue to sustain his home and improve the standard of living for him and his family.  \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Translator. <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nEl caballero Donald B. desde muy ni\u00f1o se dedica al negocio de la ganaderia agricultura siendo este su negocio con el que mantiene a su humilde familia que habita en el municipio el Obraje de la ciudad de Chinandega en Nicaragua.\r\n<p>\r\nUna problem\u00e1tica que atraviesa Donald es que en su localidad no existe energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica por estar muy lejos de la ciudad y por tal raz\u00f3n debe de alumbrarse por las noches con candelas que solamente iluminan una peque\u00f1a parte del hogar.

In 2003, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with the hope that she would be able to access financial assistance for her business. She invested previous loans in the business of grilling pork, chicken, hot dogs and many other items. The business is in demand, especially during the afternoon when kids really long for grilled hot dogs, and for men who love eating grilled pork and chicken, especially while drinking beer. The business seems to be productive and profits sound. Now on her sixth loan, she seeks the amount of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her primary business of grilling. Part of the loan will be used to pay for the sidecar of her tricycle as a secondary business.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that with the help of ASHI and Kiva, she can save money to build her own house and stop renting.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  videoke and a general store. Her husband Pedro, who is 40 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 11 children who are between 1 and 21 years old. Ma. Magadalena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Magadalena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,600 uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for business and buy stocks for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Magadalena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Dora is a young woman who due to destiny\u2019s capriciousness separated from her husband remaining in sole custody of her son.  At the beginning this was very difficult but she gradually came out of that difficult situation and started farming with her parents growing cocoa beans, coffee and citrus fruit, products that currently are selling for good prices.\r\n\r\nIn the short period of time that Dora\u2019s been doing this work she\u2019s learned to value her efforts.  She knows that the work is hard and one needs constant strength and dedication.  She\u2019s happy with the work she does because thanks to it she earns profits.  In the future she\u2019d like to open a grocery store to earn better income than presently.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first MFP loan and she commits to make her installment payments punctually.  She will use the 2500 soles to hire day laborers to help her clear weeds from her coffee fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":905423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

However, with the help of this new loan, they will be able to further expand their individual businesses, make more sales, and continues to further improve their living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1549791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy gallons of palm oil to add to her current stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Umaru ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fatmata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Billo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Musu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":991944,"name":"Danessa Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito San Vicente se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en la parroquia Picoaza de la ciudad de Portoviejo.

She earns her living with her general store, farming, food vending and being a videoke operator.\r\n\r\nErlinda\u2019s husband, Tomasito, helps her run her businesses.  They have 10 children. Six of the children have their own families and the other four are still single and help their parents with household needs.\r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store, farming, food vending and being a videoke operator. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nErlinda is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 14,500 was used to fund operations of her general store, farming, food vending and being a videoke operator, which had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use on her general store and food vending.  Erlinda is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":503845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 WST) to improve and\/or expand the business.\n\nSaitia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Saitia's 4th loan with SPBD. \n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded South Pacific Business Development to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":722831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her biggest challenges have been drought and lack of enough financing to venture fully into rabbit keeping.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan of 20,000KES through Juhudi Kilimo for rabbit keeping. The income from the sale of rabbits will help improve the livelihood of her family. In five years' time she hopes to be having over 300 rabbits of pure breed.\r\n\r\nJane is 43 years old.

This time, for her 22nd loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund the operation of her businesses so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and the education of her children.

Much like many other families in the rural locale, Buuraima and her husband fatten up livestock, after starting this business in 2001.  Having used an initial sum of 3,000 som (KGS) to start the business, today the business has four dairy cows, which allows Buuraima to earn about 4,000 som (KGS) per month from the sales of dairy products.  In order to increase milk production and further expand her business, Buuraima requested a loan in the sum of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase dairy cows.

She has been involved in this business for one year and employs one staff member. Her business is located at a strategic area, and her primary customers are local residents. \r\n\r\nShe describes her biggest business challenge to be insufficient funds for improving the business.

Three years ago, she decided to buy animals and sell them at the major livestock markets of her area.  To do this, she counts on the unconditional support of her mother and brother who help her tend to and transport her game.  The animals she sells are primarily cows and sheep and, on some occasions, pigs.  She realizes her sales mostly on weekends, when Everilda sets out all day until she completes every sale.  Thanks to her constant efforts toward the business she can sustain the household, and has plans to buy her own land to build a house and livestock stable.

Susie\u2019s Bridal Supplies. They have an unrelenting work ethic and unfailing determination to succeed. For Beatriz, a mother of two, much of her determination stems from a desire to provide for her children. \u201cMy life has not been easy, but I would like it to be easier for them. I don\u2019t want them to have to work while they are in school, it is important that they are able to focus on their studies.\u201d  \r\n\r\nWhen the sisters first purchased the store from Susie six years ago, it was a party supply store with a generalized focus. However, they saw an opportunity to increase profits so Maiela and Beatriz made the timely decision to shift their focus to provide for more elegant events such as quincea\u00f1era parties, weddings, proms, and baptisms. They now spend many of their weekends with their four part-time employees, transforming event sites into glamourous spaces fit to hold that night\u2019s celebration. \u201cEvery day and every party is a challenge. We\u2019re excited to be doing this work, we love the adrenaline rush,\u201d says Maiela. \r\n\r\nA $4,000 loan will help the sisters increase their inventory, better manage the operating costs of the store, and launch a more extensive marketing campaign. Although the economic downturn has made running a business particularly challenging, the sisters are optimistic about the future and confident in their business decisions. They work at the store every day, often until nine at night, and will do whatever is necessary to make sure their business is a success. \r\n\r\nAs Maiela explains, \u201cIf you want to survive in this world, you have to be strong, you have to work hard. We work very, very hard.\u201d   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":512655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party

S. builds, installs, and services doors and gates.  As the owner of \u201cTexas Overhead Doors,\u201d Jamie works in the residential and commercial sectors of the construction industry.  A few examples of his work include building custom gates, mounting garage doors, installing fire alarms, and removing sections of wall for new doors.  He especially enjoys doing custom work that requires him to think creatively, and he has developed the reputation of being the person to call for complicated jobs.  For example, there is a large garage door installation company who contacts him for jobs they deem to be too involved to be worth their time.  As Jamie puts it, \u201cI get a lot of weird jobs.\u201d  \r\n\r\nJamie was referred to ACCION Texas-Louisiana by his local bank.  With this loan, Jamie bought a scissor lift that helps him install large doors used for commercial buildings.  This scissor lift expands Jamie\u2019s business capabilities because its height allows him to install taller doors than he previously could.  The scissor lift Jamie bought is in good condition, and he estimates that it will last him at least ten years.\r\n\r\nThough Jamie usually works alone, he hires sub-contractors to help him with his larger commissions.  Down the road, Jamie wants his business to begin specializing in door maintenance.  Companies would have him inspect and maintain their doors to prevent them from breaking and becoming a bigger problem later.  This line of work would be advantageous to his business because it is less labor-intensive than what he does now, while still maintaining a high profit margin.  Jamie has five children, his youngest being 17-year-old twins.

She sells clothes for a living and has been doing this for several years.  She started her business with her own money that she raised by selling her spot in the Oriental Market since sales were few.   She has had better results travelling in the departments to sell her merchandise.   \r\n\r\nShe purchases by the dozen since this way she can offer better prices and she distributes to the different stores in the departments.  She is tired since she has to travel many kilometers to sell her merchandise.   Part of the investment is her own, however she uses financing which allows her to buy more and sell more since this is better in the long run.  With this loan she will buy six dozen pairs of men's and women's pants and four dozen men's and women's shirts in a variety of fabrics in order to offer different styles and colors.

They live in a house made of five rooms and two persons occupy a room. She lives in Ntangang a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nChristina N. has faced some challenges in life. The most terrifying thing that happened in her life has been the issue of accidents and death of her family members. Poverty has been her major difficulty in life, and the inability to raise capital for business projects. She plans to invest this loan in a house rental business. With this loan she plans to improve the living standard of her family with the proceeds from the investment. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time. She thinks the pressing needs of housing by inhabitants of the locality and students coming to studying in the locality will be an outstanding factor for the success of the business. The structure will be styled beautifully and hence will attract potential tenants, and subsequently lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to accommodate families and visitors to the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nChristina N. will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to expand her business and save for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

She lives in Barangay Tuguis, a part of Hinigaran municipality, Negros Occidental province on the Mindanao islands. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband, Francisco B., 55 years old, works as a guard and also helps with his wife's store. \r\n<p>\r\nRemedios joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past fifteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remedios has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, lifting the family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nFor this, her sixteenth loan, she is borrowing 21,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and savings.

This loan will be the fourth loan for Anvarjon from Imon International and he has a good credit history.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She then gets her eldest son ready for school and heads peacefully to the farm together with her husband who she loves very much.  Sumeldita grows cacao and coffee plants and a variety of citrus fruits.  These are important products which help support her family and cover her children's education expenses.  During harvest and weeding times, she must hire day laborers so that she can advance more quickly in her work.  Thanks to suggestions from the members of her community bank, she decided to come to MFP to request a loan since she was told that our institution provides loans to those who are most in need and who plan to invest their money in something useful.\r\n\r\nWith the support of lenders, Sumeldita will carry out her planned farming activities.  She needs money to buy sacks of manure so that she can improve her land and make it more productive.  She later plans to buy more land so that she can continue growing her crops.  This will be Sumeldita's first loan and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can buy the products she needs.  Sumeldita pledges to make her loan repayments on time as she would like to access other loans in the future.  She will use the 1,500 Peruvian soles to buy sacks of manure which will help her to improve her plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":799700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-27T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumeldita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1515.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835452}],"funded_date":"2011-06-28T02:48:24Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":315076,"name":"Sok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sok (in the photo) is a rice and vegetable farmer, while her husband is employed full-time in a company delivering pure drinking water.

However, he doesn't have enough money to make these purchases on his own, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Amjad gets the loan, he will be able to purchase what he needs to expand his work and enable him to compete. This will increase his sales, which will increase his income and enable him to provide better living conditions for his family. \r\n\r\nAmjad is photographed next to his stall.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
