He has lots of charisma and is a dedicated and responsible man. He has three daughters. \r\n\r\nRodrigo has set a goal for himself as a business owner, which is to create jobs.

Shoira lives there together with her husband, two small children and mother-in-law. Her husband provides a master carpenter service, renovating houses. \r\n\r\nShoira has worked at a bakery for a period of 3.5 years. She goes to work from early morning and stays there to late evening every day. Shoira bakes national flatbread in a special bread oven (tanur), which she learnt from her mother. She loves her work and works happily. \r\n\r\nThe only difficulty with Shoira's work is the transport. Due to the fact that she finishes work late, it is hard for her to get home with public transport. Therefore, she decided to purchase a vehicle, in order to solve the issue. She has decided to purchase a small car with the loan amount. Thanks to this loan, she will be able to continue her work without difficulties. Shoira hopes for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":1741870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

is 40 years old. He lives in a rented house with his wife and their five children, ages 21, 11, 7, 5 and a 3-month-old baby. Maurice runs his own Zoona mobile money transfer business in Lusaka, Zambia. The business is his only source of income.\r\n\r\nMaurice has been running his money transfer business since 2012. He attributes the growth of his business to the financial assistance he has been getting from Kiva. Maurice got his first loan in April 2012, which helped him to expand his business by opening up two more outlets in Lusaka. Maurice got a second Kiva loan, which he used to add to his working capital. This greatly helped his business, as he was able to serve customers much faster. The steady growth in Maurice\u2019s business has enabled him to employ seven people, including his 21-year-old son. Maurice says he uses the profits from his business to pay for his children\u2019s school fees, ensure that they always have good uniforms to wear to school, and provide for their day-to-day basic needs. He hopes to make more money so that providing for his family can become much easier.\r\n\r\nMaurice is requesting a subsequent loan, which he will use to continue to grow his existing business. This loan will be used to add to his working capital, so that he can successfully serve more customers who are looking to send and receive money from his three trading booths across Lusaka. Being able to serve more customers will bring Maurice additional profits that he can use to improve the lives of his children and reinvest in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1618040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to add to his working capital, so that he can successfully serve more customers who are looking to send and receive money from his three trading booths across Lusaka.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-11-27T23:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-11T23:50:09Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T23:44:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":804149,"name":"Rawya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rawya is a 46-year-old married mother of five children who six years ago started selling clothes from her house to help her husband in covering the needs and expenses of their family.\r\n\r\nToday, Rawya is acquiring a loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua to increase her business merchandise with a new collection of winter clothes to the upcoming Christmas to satisfy her customers' needs.\r\n\r\nRawya hopes to expand her business more in the future and open her own clothes shop to increase her income and improve her family's living conditions.

My grandmother is 65 and a pensioner, so their income is not enough to live and pay for my university\u2019s tuition fees.\r\n\r\nI am an Alumna of AUCA\u2019s New Generation Academy in the 2013-2014 academic year. I was lucky to be among 70 students whose study costs were covered by the donor-partner of AUCA.  New Generation Academy opened my eyes and showed me a new life of education and international atmosphere. I was able to finish this program successfully and pass AUCA\u2019s entering exams. I don\u2019t want to lose this opportunity because of a lack of money and kindly ask for Kiva lenders\u2019 help.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1742256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is very excited about this addition since now she will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nUsing this loan, Beatrice's Group will purchase a total of 14 solar lights and use the farming inputs received to plant a total of six acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1738078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light, as well as hybrid seeds and fertilizer to improve harvests of maize.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Knight","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ainea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jafred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zadock","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hezron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":118530,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118530}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T00:47:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":798746,"name":"Henry Gaspar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Antes de estudiar derecho Henry se desempe\u00f1aba en \u00e1reas parecidas esta es la raz\u00f3n por lo que escogi\u00f3 estudiar la carrera para obtener mayores conocimientos y poder aplicarlos en su trabajo.

The memory of this collective effort led him to join Simotwo self-help group. For the past 10 years Musa has been actively involved in mixed farming. He loves passion fruit farming in particular. \r\n\r\nIn rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere. Men do the heavy work on the farms, while their wives fetch water and carry firewood. However, this has not been a setback for Musa, who is not married yet has still managed to earn great profits with his farming. \r\n\r\nKapsowar is one of the places that has favorable conditions for horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Musa has always wanted to diversify and start horticulture farming, but his biggest challenge has been a lack of funds to get the business started. So, Musa is requesting a loan to start horticulture farming. \r\n\r\nThrough Simotwo self-help group - where members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan - Musa joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan, Musa intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers, and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow him to transport his produce faster to an international market, hence earning him more profits. \r\n\r\nThis loan will improve Musa's living conditions and secure the future of his children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":595.51,"image":{"id":1742320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.35,"local_amount":5590.42,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5621.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824234},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":4532.26,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4557.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262589},{"amount":54.61,"local_amount":4896.21,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4923.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264647},{"amount":54.04,"local_amount":4844.54,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4871.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600899},{"amount":58.77,"local_amount":5268.83,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5297.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459316},{"amount":59.34,"local_amount":5451.38,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5481.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.46,"payment_id":681377755},{"amount":57.59,"local_amount":5326.54,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5356,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.82,"payment_id":696587407},{"amount":60.2,"local_amount":5734.87,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5766.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.77,"payment_id":711505743},{"amount":61.36,"local_amount":5726.44,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5758.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.51,"payment_id":731022532},{"amount":64.92,"local_amount":6019.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6052.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.22,"payment_id":752110781}],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T22:03:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nathan Tichenor","image":28733}},{"id":804141,"name":"Penelope","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Penelope is 23 years old.

At first my mother worked and had a little salary in Naryn village, where we lived. Days passed, we grew older and needed more money for daily necessities, which caused my mother\u2019s departure to the neighboring country in search of a well-paid job. We were left to our relatives, who became our second parents and we still live with them on money that my mother sends.\r\n\r\nIn the 11th grade I heart about AUCA New Generation Academy, which gave an opportunity to study at this Program for free, as it was covered by its donor-partners. I understood that it was the only chance to study in the best university of Central Asia without paying a dollar. NGA program made me a confident person, who believes in his bright future and looks forward to overcome the difficulties with the help of education. My goal is to stand on my own feet and help to other families, who live in need; I know there are a lot of families like mine.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1742327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He says he is happy to finally be able to be a business owner and offer his community a way of sending and receiving money that is easy, safe and affordable. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what challenges he faces in his business, he points to the fact that he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers. He goes on to explain that this is especially a challenge for him because his shop is not located close to the bank and transport is a problem. He is therefore requesting a Kiva loan so that he can increase his working capital. He will also purchase a small trading booth which he uses to serve customers.\r\n\r\nEsby is hopeful that once he gets his Kiva loan, he will be able to serve more customers and earn more profits to help him provide for his family and see his children through high school and college.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1739597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase his trading booth and increase working capital so that he can serve more customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esby","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-02T18:45:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":804218,"name":"Pjeter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pjeter is 41 and married with three children, 17, 15 and 14 years old.

Meet David, 26 years of age, very young, hardworking and energetic. He hails from the Thika area of Kenya, an area that is blessed with good climatic conditions and favorable weather patterns that favor farming. David is still single and has been farming for the past three years. \r\n\r\nDavid was raised in a humble family, and he never got the opportunity to go to college because of lack of tuition fees. As a result, he has never had any formal employment but he didn\u2019t surrender to that. He started farming, and through farming he has been able to take care of his parents. \r\n\r\nDavid's source of income is selling vegetables, milk, and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Thika area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why David is gratefully seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nDavid is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. David's dream is to go back to school and he hopes that through your loan, you will help him realize his dream."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":437.56,"image":{"id":1742359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.89,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.78,"local_amount":9758.07,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9896.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264648},{"amount":103.26,"local_amount":9178.69,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9309.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459317},{"amount":105.26,"local_amount":9652.39,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9789.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.33,"payment_id":696587408},{"amount":111.37,"local_amount":10304.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10451.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.56,"payment_id":731022533}],"funded_date":"2015-01-02T17:01:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":804229,"name":"Rashid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rashid as an old man of 53 years and lives with his children and wife. \r\n\r\nRashid is involved in cattle rearing\/fattening from his home area in a rural setting.

While he is an enterprising and hardworking man, Isaac's age is making it hard for him to maintain the farms by himself. \r\n\r\nIsaac needs hired laborers to weed his farms, and needs to buy fertilizer and food fly traps, but there is the problem of how to finance that. Isaac needs microloan support to enable him to meet the financial needs of his farm in order to maximise crop yield and income. He will use his profits from the farms to pay for his last child's school fees and support his family. \r\n\r\nIsaac thanks all his microlenders for their generous assistance. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":31.67,"image":{"id":1735051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to weed the farm, and buy fertilizer and food fly traps","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Abura Koforidua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T06:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T06:00:04Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kobina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.67,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":101.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681285500}],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T17:24:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":804272,"name":"Kosi 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Kosi 2.

Her business is producing handmade cheese.  She's independent, tenacious, responsible, optimistic, hardworking, and a good mother.\r\n\r\nShe works in Calasaya, an indigenous community in the altiplano.  In the beginning Calasaya was a hacienda.  They adopted this name because there was a highway in the community where travelers and merchants with horses and carts from the Peruvian side would go to the city of La Paz.  Right on the side of the highway was a vertically placed stone where travelers would always rest.  People who were making long trips would say in Aymara, \"Kala saiky ukaru samara\u00f1ani,\" which translated into Spanish means \"Descansemos donde aquella piedra que est\u00e1 situada verticalmente\" 'Let's rest where that stone is placed vertically.'  So it became known as Qalasaya in Aymara, and Calasaya in Spanish.\r\n\r\nWilma is short and dark-skinned, and she wears her long black hair braided and traditional clothing (blanket, hat, and \"pollera\" skirt).  Her native language is Aymara, which she uses in the community; she speaks Spanish for business.  She lives with her son, who attends school.  They live in an adobe house that has electricity.\r\n\r\nWilma's business is making handcrafted cheese.  In summary, she follows this process: She gets cow's milk (part in the morning and part in the afternoon), and adds curd, which is made by extracting part of the udder of a cow, and the curd starts to resemble yogurt.  She mixes it with a wooden spoon, then it settles and makes the curd.  She removes it and places it in another container to ripen.\r\n\r\nWilma wants to increase her cheese production with the purchase of dairy cows to earn more income at the end of the year.  This is her first loan sequence with the institution in 15 years of working in this business.  For those reasons Wilma's requesting a loan to buy dairy cows to increase her cheese production for the end of the year.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her family's quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":603.27,"image":{"id":1735046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Sabet\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 3.5 acres of land and purchase a total of five solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fenike","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ezina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62480,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62480}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-01T20:47:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":804280,"name":"Florence's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is 45 years old and has seven children.

He hopes eventually to ensure his children are educated and have professional jobs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1632056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to meet urgent expenses like food and clothing, and reducing the pressure to sell corn at low prices right after harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T11:20:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yahaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":22895,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":22895}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-30T16:28:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":803962,"name":"Nurgul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041d\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435-\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 8,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS). \u0421 1994 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0432 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c 2 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b, 2 \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u0438, 20 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446, 2 \u043a\u043e\u0437\u044b. \u041d\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0443. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u0439 \u2013 \u0422\u0443\u0448\u0443\u043c\u00bb \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 100,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS) \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 1 \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u0438, 1 \u0431\u044b\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0438 10 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446. \u0414\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u044f\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439.","en":"Nurgul is 42 years old, married, and the mother of three children.

When you ask, he\u2019ll tell you his most valuable asset is his two-quarters-of-an-acre farm. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. \r\n\r\nFor a long time, Shadrack\u2019s farm couldn\u2019t even sustain his family. In 2012, Shadrack heard about Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance institution that serves smallholder farmers. And from that day, life has never been the same. \r\n\r\nShadrack is happily married and, together with his beautiful wife, he is blessed with one lovely child. For the past 10 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. He sells milk and farm produce to his neighbors and to the local market. However, he has been facing one big problem and that is timely delivery of the products to the market. He is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that would solve his transportation problem. \r\n\r\nKaplamai is located in a very remote area that has a poor road network and the terrain is very bad. The only mode of transport is a motorbike. This loan will be of great help because it will allow Shadrack to transport his farm products to the market and deliver them in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nMilk and vegetables are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch high prices. Through the loan, Shadrack will not be worried because he will always be able to deliver the products on time and gain more profits. This motorbike will be a reliable source for quick transportation for both long and short distances. \r\n\r\nThrough the motorbike, Shadrack's life is going to change and his standard of living is going to improve.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":633.54,"image":{"id":1742476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T12:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T12:20:07Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shadrack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5904.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.71},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":274.93,"local_amount":24437.8,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":24784.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824239},{"amount":358.61,"local_amount":31876.07,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":32328.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459319}],"funded_date":"2015-01-03T12:23:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Glenn","image":1788434}},{"id":804326,"name":"Shamim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamim is a 53-year-old married woman who has had a business buying and selling animals with the help of her husband for many years.

She completes the purchase of skirts via wholesale in the city and she distributes them to different towns in Los Yungas. (The skirts are used by the women who dress in a traditional style). Her challenge is that she has to travel constantly and this inflicts back pain from the long stretches she has to travel. She says \"Los Yungas are beautiful, it is hot and the people in the community are very friendly, the bad part is that the roads are made of dirt and after so much travel my back hurts a lot.\" Her dream is to start a seamstress shop and to be able to sell skirts from her own production. She wants to complete the purchase of special occasion skirts via wholesale to take advantage of her sales at the end of the year.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Jennifer\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 11.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 10 solar lights.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-28T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-12T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rophina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manasseh A","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sharon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Augusta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":173780,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-29T04:38:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":804372,"name":"Benjamin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benjamin is applying for a loan of GHS 1,500 to improve his maize business.

Her husband works clearning land for farming and at farms in the area. 18 months ago Diana started selling clothing and perfume. This is her first loan with Fodemi and she joined the group through a friend who invited her and her mother. Her mother is leader of the group and is very beloved in the community.  In this town there is not drinkable water service and there are no rivers. Water is retrieved from subterranean wells. There are no health centers but there is an elementary school.  The inhabitants of the community, like Diana, have requested to the authorities to provide these necessary services soon.  Within 3 years Diana hopes to be able to acquire a display case to better display her products to customers. Thanks to her savings, she and her husband have been able to build their own home.

They live in a brick house that has potable water and electric lighting. \r\n\r\nHis business is dry cleaning. He makes a living by removing stains and dirt from linings and interlinings, in addition to articles of clothing that have the dry cleaning symbol in their cleaning instructions. Moisture damages these types of garments. For this reason, he uses waterless liquids. These liquids, which are used for dry cleaning, do not seep into the fabric the way that water does, which keeps the garments in good condition. The liquids dissolve grease, oil, wax, or gum.\r\n\r\nJulio says, \u201cI started as an assistant in a nearby dry cleaner. Later, with time, I obtained a machine that I currently use for my work. I see a lot of business opportunities in which I would like to invest.\u201d His dream is to have locations all over the city. He wants to expand his business by investing in a dry cleaning machine to improve his work and to furnish his services for the end-of-year movement. This is the first sequence of loans that he requests from the institution in the eight years that he has been in this occupation. \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Julio is requesting a loan to buy

With the intention of contributing more income to her family, which is made up of her husband and their 4 children, she currently owns a small tamale business.
