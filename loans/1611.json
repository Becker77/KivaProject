She is a single mother to one young child and lives with her mother, whom she helps to support. \r\n\r\nFilomena will use this loan to buy stone, cement, sand and metal bars to build a separate outbuilding on her land that can be rented in order to increase the family's income. Her projects and dreams for the future are to build even more outbuildings that can be rented and to go back to school to get a college education. \r\n\r\nFilomena says that the main challenges she has faced have been financial ones.

He makes cheese and Georgian-style yogurt called matsoni. In order to have healthy natural products, his cows are only fed grass, hay and grain but no antibiotics or other additives. According to the anthroposophic teaching, Mikheil makes a point of respect and good surroundings for his animals, which has a positive effect on the milk they give.\r\n\r\nMost of the cheese, yogurt and milk is sold at the Waldorf school for the pupils and their families. In this way, they have the opportunity to buy high-quality healthy dairy products.

They even transport from one town to the other. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP a day. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue his transport business, he is requesting a 10000 PHP loan, which he will use to pay for gas and the repair of his tricycle. He is positive that this will boost his income, as tricycle transportation is really a necessity in their place. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to him.\r\n\r\nAndy hopes that his tricycle service will continue and aims to buy another unit to improve his income.

He has also been in the cattle business for two years, and their family has seven years of experience running a small store.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase basic grains, sodas and other beverages; as well as kitchen products and toiletries. These will stock the merchandise in the store, so that Carlos can maintain the stability of the store. There is a nearby mill, and when people go to the mill, the majority of them stop by the store to purchase items. \r\n\r\nCarlos' dream is that his children will be able to complete their studies - three of them have high school degrees, but he hopes that they will manage to finish university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":464.82,"image":{"id":1735408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her family members are all on good terms with each other, and her family is respected by many people.  Irina has a university education and works at a school as a math teacher while also raising livestock for a living.  She first started her livestock business in 2008, and is now a successful farmer with her own small farm consisting of two horses, two cows, twenty sheep and fifteen goats, while her net income each month is around 15,000 som.  Irina is seeking a loan of 100,000 som from Bai Tushum Bank to buy two bull calves and some sheep.  She tries her best to reinvest all her extra money back into her business, and wants to bolster her livestock headcount as well as set aside money for a new car for her family.\r\n\r\n

She is only 20 years old and she doesn't have a higher education.  She works in a bakery and bakes traditional cakes.  She has been involved in this activity for two-and-a-half years already.

At 47 years old she fights to get them ahead through education and a good life example. Teresita\u2019s efforts and the support of the people she knows allowed her to open her small store 2 years ago and to maintain her weekend food sales, by which she became well known in the area. After visiting and sharing in this family\u2019s poverty, one notices the good manners and friendliness of its members who work as a team to achieve a better quality of life. Her youngest daughter is in fourth grade with excellent marks.\r\n\r\nHer work selling food and the support of her daughters allow her to fix up the front of her humble home with materials that many consider rubbish. She set up her shelves, racks, work desk and cash register, thus opening up her store to the community. She has established herself during 3 years working and offers fashion merchandise and sandals that are very popular in the Puntarenas area. In reviewing business documents, the additional income from food and the support of her daughters, this business, which is a group effort from all of the family, allows them to attend to their customers and to offer very high quality merchandise. The loan will allow her to purchase and diversify her products, to grow and to support her children in school, which is her main objective.\r\n\r\nThe store is located in a poor neighborhood in the Puntarenas area. She wishes to invest in seasonal clothing for new years and for summer vacation.\r\nAn example in the area for effort and dedication to her children, her store is unique in the area and a reference for many people who buy quality, fashionable clothing in spite of her store\u2019s humble conditions.  With the support of her youngest children they sell food on the weekends and tend to the business. She wants them to continue studying and to obtain a career, thus improving their standard of living.

years old, a widow, and the mother of five children.  She has the equivalent of a high school education.  In order to provide her family with an additional source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture since 2005.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns one cow, eight sheep and four horses.  She also owns 0.8 hectare of land on which she grows corn and alfalfa.  She makes a monthly income of 8,000 som (KGS), which is vastly insufficient to provide her family and herself with decent living conditions.  For this reason, and to further grow her business, Gulzat has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy sheep for fattening and resale.

She was born in the countryside and since childhood has been accustomed to the hardships of the field. Nargiza works as a schoolteacher, but a teacher's salary is not sufficient for the family needs. Therefore, she raises livestock. On her own plot of land, she tends to five cows. The milk received from the cows is sold by Nargiza's daughter at the market. She wants to give her children everything so that they will not know the needs of life, in order to receive a good education and to be able to support themselves with a prosperous life. <br \/><br \/>This year, her eldest son graduated from high school, but Nargiza does not have the full sum to pay for his education. Therefore, she applied to MDO Arvand for financial support. Nargiza hopes that MDO Arvand will respond to her request for help and will allocate her the needed sum. She sends her thanks in advance for the support and

They are doing a survey for the elimination of poverty. Through 50 indicators, they will understand the life situation of each member and continue improving.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Mariza, who in her last survey showed a poverty level inside level two. That means she's at a middle level, improving through effort, steady work and the sale of food like empanadas, various foods and more.\r\n\r\nMariza seeks this loan to buy vegetables, meat, eggs and more, which will help her increase production and sales of food at the same time, which will improve her income.

Her children are grown and live independently. Saliya has received secondary education. She is a calm, even-tempered and hard-working person by nature. As a main source of income for her family, she has been raising livestock for many years. Thanks to Saliya's hard work, she now has five cows and 10 goats on her farm. In order to develop her business further, Saliya has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy livestock.

","en":"Asylkan is 49 years old, married,  and has three children. Asylkan has received secondary education. Her husband and children help her out on the farm. As a main source of income for her family, Asylkan has been raising livestock since 2002. Thanks to Asylkan's hard work, she now has two cows and 20 goats on her farm. Asylkan's business brings in about 10,000 KGS per month. In order to develop her business further, she has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy livestock and increase her headcount. Asylkan is one of the three members of the Roza [\"Rose\"] borrowers' group. She plans to use the resulting revenue for a further expansion of her farm and would like to finish the construction of a shed.

He is 22 years old and lives in the Litein area of Kenya. It is a popular tea-growing region. Dominic is a family man, blessed with a beautiful wife and one adorable child, who always bring a smile to his face. Dominic has farmed for five years. He has gathered so much experience that he is known as the best farmer in his village. Although he practices mixed farming, he really loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cSeroy\u201d (the name of a person).<br \/><br \/>Dominic comes from a humble background and he had to work his way up. He is determined to succeed and puts twice the effort into his business. Although he earns a decent income, his biggest challenge is the lack of a dairy building, in which to milk his cows and rest his cows. Poor weather conditions affect the health of his cows, and he has to spend money buying medicine. The loan will help Dominic to comfortably milk his cows and save money that he used to spend in buying medicine. Dominic will be able to collect cow dung and urine, and will use it in his farm to increase productivity. Dominic is a very enterprising man who wants to provide a safe and secure future, and a solid education, for his family. This is a privilege he never had. Through increased profits from selling milk, Dominic will improve his life and realize his

Meet Geoffrey, 25, who is based in the Litein area of Kenya. This area may be the major 'bread basket' of the country, but it is increasingly emerging as an important dairy farming zone for the East Africa. Thousands of farmers are now finding dairy farming a good supplement, if not a substitute, for maize.\r\n\r\nThis father of three has been practicing mixed farming for the past four years and his primary source of income has been milk and eggs. He passionately loves dairy farming and he enjoys feeding \u201cSeroy\u201d (the name of his cow). Milking his cow is his hobby. Waking up every morning to milk his cow is very fulfilling to him. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge he faces is the lack of a proper dairy unit where his cows can feed and rest.

Having done mixed farming for the past 15 years, he has gained much experience and he offers free extension services to young upcoming farmers. He is happily married and is blessed with four lovely school-going children. \r\n\r\nThomas enjoys generating income from selling milk, his harvest, and produce from his farm. He finds dairy farming very fulfilling, but the main challenge he faces is not being able to properly feed his dairy cows. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan he will be able to cut hay into small pieces before mixing it with other forage to feed his cattle. The chaff cutter will aid his cattle in digestion and will prevent his dairy cattle from rejecting any part of their food. Proper feeding of your cattle is one of the most important factors in maintaining high yield production of milk. Through proper feeding, his cow will produce more milk and this will translate to more profits and improved living standards. \r\n\r\nWhen he was asked how this loan will benefit his family, Thomas said \u201cmore income\u201d. Profits from the loan will be used in fully repaying the loan and improving the standard of living for his parents, family, and his school-going

He is in the business of artisanal cheese production.  He is a good father and an active, honest, enterprising, perseverant, and hard-working man.  He carries out his business in the community of Karapata located close to Lake Titicaca.  This area has an extreme climate characterized by large variations in temperature between days and nights.  It is sunny during the daytime with  temperatures reaching 25\u00baC (77\u00ba F), and it rarely rains.  The nights are always cold.\r\n\r\nMario is short-statured with a dark complexion and short black hair.  His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, which is spoken in this area.  He speaks Spanish when doing business in the city.  He lives his life accompanied by his wife who is dedicated to farming and raising their four children.  The oldest child is working towards a technical degree and the three younger children go to school as well as working on the farm.  The whole family lives in an adobe house with electricity and running water.  \r\n\r\nMario is in the business of artisanal cheese production. The variety of cheese which is most produced and consumed in the area is known as \"queso fresco\", or \"fresh cheese\".  In practical terms, it can be divided into raw and cooked varieties, which are made from country-style curds created by the pasteurization process which are salted and moulded.  He also makes \"quesillo\" (\"farmer's cheese\") and \"double cream cheese\", which in the case of the latter is cooked after obtaining the curds and formed into a hemisphere of wax or \"paila\".  The curds are either dry-cooked, or boiled in water or buttermilk, according to the type of production.\r\n\r\nMario comments that he is passionate about his work and that he is always looking for ways to improve the cheese-making process.  His dream is to produce cheese to sell in markets and supermarkets in the city, and he wants to expand his business by buying better milk cows to increase his production of milk and cheese.  This is his first sequence of loans with this institution in the three years that he has been in this business.  For the aforementioned reasons, Mario is asking for a loan to buy milk cows in order to increase his production of milk and cheese.

Meet Josephat. He is a 42-year-old farmer from Thuita village, situated in the Central province of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and four children on a small piece of land where he keeps dairy cows and poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. \r\n\r\nFor ten years, his primary sources of income have been eggs and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. \r\n\r\nJosephat made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime last month, he applied for a loan for expanding his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families. \r\n\r\nWith your loan, Josephat's children will acquire a quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1743433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand his horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-29T05:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-13T05:00:08Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185.68,"local_amount":16146.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":16757.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824259},{"amount":47.27,"local_amount":4110.62,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4266.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264661},{"amount":342.05,"local_amount":29743.26,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":30869.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600909}],"funded_date":"2015-01-04T15:30:22Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":805041,"name":"Vicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicent a 65-year-old man living in Bundibugyo-Uganda.

Elmira\u2019s elder son is now passing his military service at the army and her smallest son is still school-aged. After school he manages to help his lovely mother in farming and agriculture, in which Elmira has been fully engaged already 20 years. In her farm she has a cow, a bull, a calf, four sheep, two lambs and 20 chickens. She says that her day and night work in her cute farm gives her a chance of providing her children with good living conditions.

is a freshman in the American University of Central Asia (AUCA')s Software Engineering Department and this is his story:\r\n\r\nI am requesting the loan for my undergraduate studies in the Software Engineering Program. These studies will allow me to be a competent professional in the work market and to find a job that is commensurate with my abilities. Having technical knowledge in this area opens doors to many other opportunities in my career. Also, number crunching and financial analysis are very interesting and challenging for me.\r\n\r\nI have a father and a little sister. To help my father, we studied well at school and did not have to pay a dollar for high school. I was good at maths and computing so, in the 10th grade, I decided to be a programmer. Now my goal is to graduate from AUCA, have an internship in Europe, then return and work in Kyrgyzstan. As software engineering is a new sphere in my country, there are not enough good specialists to provide me with more opportunities for self-realization in my motherland. And the Kiva loan will ensure that I will be able to do this.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1743503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
