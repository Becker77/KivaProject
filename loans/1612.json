He is committed to his wife with whom he is blessed to have five children. Like most small-scale farmers in rural Kenya, Solomon has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years, producing milk, tea, and crops, as well as doing some small personal business. He has been able to earn a decent income. Solomon loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his dairy cows \u201cKoriot,\u201d which is from a person\u2019s name. He loves milking Koriot and feeding his cow is his hobby. Dairy farming is very fulfilling to Solomon. Although he makes a profit from selling milk, he is faced with one major challenge that is dragging him behind, which is the lack of a proper dairy unit. \r\n\r\nSolomon is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. A modern dairy unit will assist him in properly feeding his cows and also being able to milk them properly. With this loan, his cows will not be affected by harsh weather conditions because they will have a comfortable place to stay. All this will result in increased production of milk and will lead to improved profits. Solomon is a believer that freedom from poverty is a basic human right and through this loan he will get out of the poverty bracket he is in right now. He believes this loan from Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva will create ripples of changes in his living conditions. Because of the partnership between Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, aspiring men such as Solomon are assured of achieving their dreams through loans and technical

represent his group of 16 farmers in Kakamega South District. He is 65 years old, is married and has 8 children.\r\n\r\nStephen likes to think of himself as a very resourceful person. He has been working alongside One Acre Fund since 2013 and decided to represent his group because he wanted to help more farmers.

With the passage of time she met her current husband with whom she has conceived three children, 16 year old eldest child, the 11 year old second child, and the 6 year old third child. All of them help their parents after school, getting involved day after day in the farm work while at the same time being taught about the values and sacrifice their parents make to give them the best, and learning what it takes to get ahead.\r\n\r\nFor years they have worked in planting and growing coffee, which they learned from their parents as a source of employment and income for their families.

He grew up with his grandparents who formed and instilled in him good values and moral principles which have led him to be a very educated and respected person in his community.\r\n\r\nJose learned the construction trade from an uncle who lived with his grandparents while he was growing up.  He thus gained experience and today it is the main source of income along with raising livestock which serves to bring the daily bread for his family.  His family consists of his wife and his son who is studying in the school in their community.\r\n\r\nJose has been working in agriculture and masonry from the age of 20 years.  With the profits that were generated, he has decided to continue these activities as they have become their main source of income.  His wife also makes an economic contribution to their family because she is dedicated to managing a store that that they own.  Together they can meet the needs of their home and pay their financial obligations.\r\n\r\nThe money will be used to buy rice, beans, sugar, corn, salt, flour, eggs, etc. for re-sale.

Another of the projections for the future are buying a vehicle for transportation and to move masonry materials to his workplace.

cattle.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":844.28,"image":{"id":1736512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He grew up with his parents who raised him and taught him the principles that have made him a polite, well-regarded person in his community.\r\n\r\nNieves learned construction work from his father, and thus gained experience in the trade that is now the primary source of income that he uses to put food on his family's table and also pay his financial commitments.\r\n\r\nHis wife contributes financially to the family, by selling pupusas on the weekends; this is how she helps provide the household necessities.\r\n\r\nThe loan he's applying for from CREDICAMPO is to purchase sand, cement, and gravel to build some rooms in the outer part of his house to subsequently rent to travelers and teachers that work at the educational center. This way, he'll have more income since he figures on collecting $90.00 monthly, which will help pay off his loans.\r\n\r\nHis goals in the future are to have a house that's fixed-up and better furnished, to obtain a new loan to purchase a vehicle, and to help his kids with their studies since one of them dreams of becoming a veterinarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1736519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is a woman well known for her productive activities as well as belonging to the association for community development.\r\n\r\nMaria has 15 years of experience working with livestock. This is an activity she learned from her grandmother who worked all her life and who taught good ideas and principles to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy concentrate for livestock because they are entering the summer season and it is necessary to prepare feed to get through the year.  A portion of the money will also be used in preparation of pastures for livestock.\r\n\r\nThe goals she has for the future are to pay back the loan and obtain another for the improvement of facilities where the cattle are kept.

For years she has been in the business of planting and growing coffee, and this work has been the main source of income and improvement for her and her family for years. She only completed the first grade since her parents didn't have enough money to keep her in school. Doris is married and she has three children: her oldest daughter is 25 years old, her second daughter is 20 and her youngest daughter is 19. With a lot of hard work, she and her husband gave them the best possible opportunities so that they could stay in school and make the most of themselves in life. \r\n\r\nThe land that they work was inherited from their parents; they have thirty years of experience working the land. The plot is located just 100 meters from their home, making it easy to walk there and easy to give it the constant attention it needs. Her goal for her coffee crop is that it become one of the mot productive in the area, generating enough credibility and income to sustain their household and properties, which will become self sufficient going forward.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, she is requesting support from Kiva investors which she will use to buy the necessary supplies to develop, care for, and protect the plants and the beans for the season as well as to pay for qualified labor that will make the best use of her supplies and give her property both more and better

A big part of that is their education as Irma strives to ensure that her children have more opportunities than she herself had as a child.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband made the decision together to plant and raise coffee because it's a profitable crop whenever the plant and the land are well tended and cared for. They inherited their land from her in-laws, and it is located about two kilometers from their home. They are able to walk that distance to provide it with the care and attention that it needs to be productive and self sustaining. Their only challenge is the increasing prices for supplies and transporting them. This challenge is why Irma is seeking financial support to be able to buy and transport both supplies and manual labor to help with the crops.\r\n\r\nIrma's goals as a mother are to keep investing in her children's schooling, supporting them as much as she can so that they can be better and achieve more; to continue to expand her business and her property so that she can leave her children a strong inheritance; and to keep her family life running."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1736533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy and transport farming supplies for growing coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-11-29T18:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-13T18:20:07Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-19T03:59:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":799841,"name":"Bolivianitas Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cBOLIVIANITAS II\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Villa Exaltaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 compuesta por nueve  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Porfiria es la Secretaria.

","en":"Humayro is a woman of 30. She was born in the Spitamen region. She is married and has two children: a daughter and a son. Humayro's children go to kindergarten. Despite the daily activities of the household, Humayro devotes her time to her children. Humayro is very close to nature. She grows potted plants. In the spring, she buys seeds of unusually beautiful flowers and plants them in the garden. Humayro's husband is involved in the business. Humayro herself is a very industrious woman. Such that she would not be involved only in domestic activities, her husband bought her cattle. She has good experience in the sphere of  animal husbandry. Besides that, she sews national dresses.

He began with a business of selling natural juices as a street vendor, but his income was very little for supporting his son. Eight years ago he decided to set up a regular business such as a grocery store, where he sells basic food products such as rice, beans, lard, eggs, coffee, salt, sugar, flour, soft drinks, meats, dairy products, churros (a doughnut-like snack), etc., and he also sells footwear and novelties.

When asked what\u2019s the most enjoyable thing about farming, he answered, \u201cI get food to eat and to sell\u201d. Cornelius has expansive land, and has planted enough Napier grass. He has always wanted to buy a good breed of dairy cow, but has been challenged by a lack of finances. Through Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, he will make his dream a reality. He underwent training with Juhudi Kilimo, and has learned that microfinances help the poor access financing, and help them in their projects.

This will help to make the most of the time and supplies invested in her coffee crops. \r\n\r\nJuana hopes to be supported by the different investors of the Kiva platform, since it is her wish to enhance her property and support each of her children. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1736541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy supplies and pay for specialized labor to assist her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-11-29T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-13T20:30:03Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":28000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T11:55:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marila Arana","image":1590928}},{"id":805279,"name":"Alex's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex is a 28-year-old proud father of 5 children.

Bella hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build some rental houses. \r\n\r\nBella is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Bella who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":997.26,"image":{"id":1743712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

The loan will be used to buy more sacks of maize flour and beans to  sell, and will help Joram to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children. Joram hopes that in the future he will be able to own a very big supermarket. \r\n\r\nJoram is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Joram who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":831.94,"image":{"id":1743719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Inusa, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income he earns to expand his farmland, and hopes to ensure his children are educated and have professional jobs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1628352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-11-29T21:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-13T21:20:09Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inusa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":21748,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":21748}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-11-29T21:44:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":798897,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mario vive en la ciudad de Pilar, tiene un hijo y tambi\u00e9n su pareja, comenta que trabaja con su hermano en su empresa como instalador de ventanas de blindex y otros.\n\u00c9l a la vez que trabaja tambi\u00e9n estudia la carrera de an\u00e1lisis de sistemas, y comenta que su mayor meta es terminar su carrera para acceder a un t\u00edtulo universitario y seguir capacit\u00e1ndose para ascender y progresar en la vida.\nPide este pr\u00e9stamo para poder invertirlo en sus gastos de titulaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"Mario lives in the city of Pilar.

by poverty. Nonetheless there are people there who want to make progress and show that they don\u2019t have to keep living that same story. One of these is Simon, who is 24 years of age, hardworking and energetic. He hails from Kipkenyo, a remote village in Eldoret, an area that is blessed with good climatic conditions and favorable weather patterns that favor farming. \r\n\r\nSimon is still single and has been doing farming for the past three years. Simon was raised in a humble family, and he never got the opportunity to go to college because of lack of tuition fees. As a result of this, he never got any formal employment and didn\u2019t surrender to that. He started farming, and through farming he has been able to take care of his family and also to take care of his parents. \r\n\r\nSimon's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. The Eldoret area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Simon is kindly seeking a loan to buy another motorbike. \r\n\r\nThrough the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Simon is very determined to succeed and because he is much disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his parents. \r\n\r\nSimon's dream is to go back to school and he hopes that through your loan, you will help him realize his

The ladies are requesting a new loan and are most hopeful that KIVA investors will fund it.\r\n\r\nIn the previous loan cycle, we shared the story of Fermina, a 36 year-old woman, who has a palm mat business. She wants to express her appreciation to KIVA investors for their financial help. With her loan, Fermina was able to maintain her palm mat business and generate an income. Because she is an ambitious woman and has five children, Fermina recently decided to start an animal husbandry business. She wants to buy pigs and is hopeful that this new business, combined with her palm mat business, will enable her to generate additional income and raise the standard of living for her five children.\r\nFriendship Bridge believes that for best results in eliminating poverty, microcredit must be combined with education, or \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.

Some of the topics covered include effective business management practices (business design, budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service), hygiene, health, and the use of medicinal plants, as well as empowerment and self-esteem.

de Chipaca I\u201d or \u201cHope of Chipaca I\u201d look forward to generating additional household income, sending their children to school and boosting their self-esteem. The ladies of this Trust Bank, who live in a rural area of Chichicastenango, Guatemala, work in their various small businesses that include traditional textile production (weaving and embroidery), agriculture (apples and peaches) as well as animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nManuela is a member of the Trust Bank. She is 28 years old, with two children who are four and seven years of age. Her husband is a farmer. Manuela has been a weaver since childhood. After her marriage, she began her animal husbandry business since the couple needed extra income. Manuela is requesting a loan that she is planning to use for the purchase of thread in various colors and other supplies. The end of the year is approaching with many celebrations including graduations, parties and weddings. She wants to have all of her supplies in order and plenty of inventory on hand. Manuela will also use part of her loan to purchase feed for her 10 roosters, 30 chickens and 3 pigs.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of her friends in the Trust Bank, Manuela appreciates the help of KIVA investors throughout the world in funding loans. With these small loans and education, the women are more prepared to be productive, support their children and create a more prosperous future for themselves, their families and their community.

Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for 20 years now.  They are currently growing maize, sorghum, beans, and groundnuts. Joseph is excited about beekeeping as it will earn him some income from the sale of honey and provide him with honey for food and medicine. \r\n\r\nThis is Joseph's first loan with Honey Care.  He plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and to provide clothing for his family. Joseph's hope for the future is to live in a better house and to buy an ox for ploughing.\r\n\r\nJoseph lives in Ogongo, a small town in Homa Bay County, located at the south-western tip of Kenya.  Its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people; a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay often boasts traders from Ugandan, Tanzania and Kenya, who arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of county means that poverty rates are quite high, many people hold a strong cultural emphasis on education.  School attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7.02,"image":{"id":1727446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ogongo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2014-11-29T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-13T22:40:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":17100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":17100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.02,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":633.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624251088}],"funded_date":"2014-12-02T04:55:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":805435,"name":"Namai Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chantha is excited that he, like his group members, was able to purchase a water filter.

Even though some people in the villages, including Chantha\u2019s, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income for users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water.

Because of financial difficulties, she has decided to support her husband and start her own business.  Umida's family is very friendly and Umida herself has a lot of ambitions.  She works as a seamstress and likes her job very much.  She runs her own business and has a lot of customers.  This year, Umida has decided to buy the fabrics that she needs by herself, as well as some basic supplies to expand her business, and to do so by sewing and selling some clothes for the poorest local residents.  But because she is experiencing financial difficulties herself, she has turned to MDO Arvand and requested a loan.  Umida hopes that MDO Arvand will help her solve her financial problems.  She is interested in pursuing a long-term relationship with this organization."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1739260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabrics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She did not finish her higher education.  She works as a weaver in a sewing shop.  To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is also involved in animal husbandry.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns four cows and five sheep.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 som (KGS).  She has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to renovate her house.  She will use this loan to purchase some laminate, wall paper and paints.  Once she finishes renovating her house, she and her family will be able to move back into their home.  Right now, they cannot live in it and the family has to live with in-laws.
