He comes from a large family with many children, and his parents have to work  long hours in order to support the family. Kamoljon himself has been working as a seasonal agricultural worker from an early age on, whenever he had free time from school. After finishing secondary school, Kamoljon has decided to go to college and major in economics, but because of financial difficulties, his parents were unable to provide him with a proper education. Kamoljon was very glad to find out about Arvand's education loan and he decided to take out such a loan himself. Kamoljon thanks Arvand in advance for its help to low-income rural dwellers.

His business involves trading cattle.\r\n\r\nBenedicto is independent, active, persevering, responsible, and hardworking.  He conducts his business in the community of Viruyo, which is located near Lake Titicaca.  This area has steep inclines of average depth and clay soil that has poor drainage.  This leads to flooding problems.  The lake is at an altitude of 3,810 meters above sea level.  The terrain is flat or near-flat with slight inclinations.  The weather is cold and humid because of the proximity of the lake.   \r\n\r\nBenedicto has a dark complexion, short stature, short black hair, and a moustache.  His native language is Aymara, which he speaks in his hometown.  Whenever he travels to the city, Benedicto speaks Spanish.  He lives with his mother and cares for her because she is not able to see.  They live in an adobe house that has electricity.  His business involves trading cattle for producing milk and making dairy products.  Whenever he raises cattle, Benedicto buys fodder so that the animals can develop.  He cares for them and fattens them up before selling them.  He also sells milk to local cheese producers.  \u201cEvery day I let my cows out to graze since I have rented approximately one square kilometer of pasture land.  I also feed them myself in order to take care of them,\u201d says Benedicto.  The local climate makes his work difficult.  During the winter, the pastures dry out and the cows are not able to produce milk in the cold weather.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a large stable where he can house his cattle.  Benedicto wants to buy better breeding cattle to add to his stable.  This is his first loan with Emprender.  He has been in this line of work for eight years.  \r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Benedicto is requesting a loan.  He will buy better breeding cattle for his stable.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":580.01,"image":{"id":1735228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy better breeding cattle to add to his stable.

She is a good mother and is hardworking, responsible, active, and consistent. She works in the \"panamericana\" zone, and area known for informal, popular commerce of all types. It has a moderate climate year-round and is about 2500 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nMaria has brown skin, is short, and has long, brown hair. Her native language is Quechua and she speaks Spanish for business purposes. She lives with her son, who is in school, in her mother's home, which is made of brick and has running water and electricity.\r\n\r\nShe makes a living by selling fried chicken in a stall in the street near her home. She uses pieces of tender chicken, which is sometimes floured or battered, and fries them. The breading adds a crunchy, exterior crust that keeps the juices in but also absorbs the fat used to fry the chicken. The thing that distinguishes her fried chicken from other fried chicken is that the others often cut the chicken at the joint and leave the bones and skin intact. Crispy, well-seasoned skin, without excess fat, is the distinguishing element of her excellent fried chicken.\r\n\r\nShe says, \"My business is humble. My experience at this job has taught me to improve my production daily; that is why I have constant customers and my business prospers.\" Her dream is to have a large stall to sell in bulk and she hopes to make an investment in her business by purchasing supplies like oil, spices, potatoes, chicken, etc. in bulk. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with this institution in the 10 years that she has had her business.

Moralita has requested a loan of 15,000 PHP to buy additional piglets and pig feed. With these, she can raise and sell more pigs in the coming few months. Hopefully, this will augment her income, and she will probably be able to afford to buy good food and have better living conditions for her family.\r\n\r\nMoralita would like to expand her pig raising business so that it becomes successful. She especially would like to provide her children with a college education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1744164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Disaster

His business is a bakery.  \r\n\r\nLucio is an entrepreneur and a good father.  He is also persevering, active, patient, responsible, and hardworking.  Lucio conducts his business in the town of Batallas, which is located 60 kilometers from the highway that runs from La Paz to Tiquina.  This area is located on the edge of Lake Titicaca, where one can appreciate the traditional setting of the high plains.  Batallas is famous in Bolivia for being the traditional place where \u201cmarraqueta\u201d is produced, which is also known as \u201cBatalla bread\u201d.  Whenever people pass through town, it is recommended that they try this famous bread.  \r\n\r\nLucio has a dark complexion, black and gray hair, and a medium stature.  His native language is Aymara, which he speaks in his hometown.  Whenever he conducts business in the city, Lucio speaks Spanish.  The life he has made with his wife has been devoted to trade and their three children.  The oldest child is pursuing a higher education, while the two younger children are attending school.  They live in a brick and adobe house that has running water and electricity because it is located in the center of town.  His business is a bakery.  Lucio makes \u201cmarraqueta\u201d or \u201cBatalla bread\u201d, which is a type of South American bread that is consumed in Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.  It is made of white flour, water, yeast, and salt.  However, it takes a longer time to ferment than other breads.  This type of bread has no fat and is known for its peculiar shape -- it is portioned into four sections, which makes it easy to split and divide.  It also has a crunchy texture.  \u201cI have engaged in this type of work since my youth since I learned the recipe from my parents.  I will continue in this same line of work, but I also have other duties,\u201d says Lucio.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is to expand his business.

who gladly help with the business. Uulzhan has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for 2 years. Now Uulzhan's farm has 4 cows and 13 sheep, and also 0.2 hectares of leased and 0.7 hectares of owned land, where she grows corn, tobacco and potatoes for sale. Her monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS).

This would allow her to offer a greater variety and thus increase her income and allow her to save towards her dream of expanding the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1737616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, beans, corn, soft drinks, instant soups, and vegetables among other products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Guadalupe \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":730,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":121.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:22:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610605368},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":60.83,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624461888},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":60.83,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636864770},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":60.83,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649617019},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":62.58,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":64.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665097116},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":60.83,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681395388},{"amount":310.71,"local_amount":302.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":310.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605688}],"funded_date":"2015-01-09T23:06:13Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T15:16:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nele Rodiek","image":null}},{"id":802040,"name":"D\u00e9d\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D\u00e9d\u00e9 a pour mari un cuisinier.

She is married and has three children. Nargis loves children and this is also her work. Nargis works as a kindergarten teacher in the Shahrituz region. She thinks she is very fortunate with her job. She has worked in this kindergarten for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nNargis' husband works as a butcher. They have been married a long time. When the expression \"the man is the head and the woman is the neck\" (Russian expression on how man and wife need eachother) was made, they were describing Nargis and her husband.

He has been practicing farming for the past five years, and has never looked back. His primary sources of income have been eggs, milk, and crops. Most of the small holder farmers in Kamoiywa village own approximately one acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Zakayo has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. Kamoiywa village is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition. This has hampered Zakayo from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Zakayo sells vegetables, milk, and tomatoes, which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price.\r\n\r\nZakayo is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely manner and overcome the challenge of facing losses. With the loan, he will deliver the products to the market on time and this means he will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. Zakayo plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan in full and invest in a solid foundation for his family to come.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":672.05,"image":{"id":1744388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal

She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nBernadeth earns income through livestock farming. She is very particular in raising carabaos, or water buffalo. The carabao has traditionally played a central part in rice farming in the Philippines. Carabaos are useful on and around the farm and represent a major capital investment that can be either hired out to other farmers or, in case of emergency, sold. Carabaos are used for land preparation and plowing. They are a source of manure and serve as a means of transport. Carabao milk may be drunk or made into cheese. Bernadeth makes a minimum of PHP 20,000 net income every month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Bernadeth is requesting a loan of PHP 50,000. She will use the loan to buy additional carabaos and feed and to pay for the housing of these carabaos. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBernadeth hopes that she can continue to meet the needs of her family through their business and she wants to save for their future goals and possible business opportunities.

Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nCorazon hopes to maintain and grow her business so she can help her grandchildren finish school until college.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 pesos loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nClarina dreams of a good life and future for her family. She wants for her children to finish their studies.

Brian, who is 24 years old, is a mixed farmer from Eldoret, a rural town in Kenya. He has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. This hardworking single man earns his livelihood through selling milk, crops and a personal business he engages in when the harvests are low. \r\n\r\nBrian passionately loves poultry farming, and rearing chickens is his hobby. Every day he wakes up in the morning to collect eggs and feed his chickens, and he finds this very fulfilling. Neighbors have been flocking to his compound to buy eggs, and through word of mouth, news has spread like fire in the whole village that he has quality eggs. The demand is so high he cannot fully satisfy it. \r\n\r\nBrian is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, Brian will be able to satisfy the demand, and this will translate to an increased income level. Through Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, Brian believes that small-scale farmers like him will be able to benefit from financial solutions. \r\n\r\nPoultry meat is a very popular meal among many people in his village, and this translates to improved income and better living standards. Brian will sell eggs for commercial purposes and for home consumption. Increased income will allow Brian to provide nothing but the best for his family and improve their living conditions.

Kamala Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In September 2014, 10 active women entrepreneurs of Tetelkhunti village of Balangir district in Odisha, India, formed a Self Help Group named Maa Kamala to access a loan from the Mahashakti Foundation for expanding their small enterprises. \r\n\r\nKabita, the lady standing raising her hand in the photo, is one of them. Kabita is a poor lady of 28 years of age and lives with her husband and one daughter of 8 years old. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. The government has provided a house to her under Indira Awash Yojana (Housing Scheme).\r\n\r\nKabita has been running a spice-vending business with items like chili, cumin seeds, coriander, turmeric, garlic, etc., for the last six years. Her husband goes to five weekly markets of her locality in a week with bulk of items on a bicycle and sells in the market. Twice a week, he goes to the nearby town of 12 kilometers away and buys the spice items from a wholesaler. Often, he has to buy the items on credit. Because of this, he has to bear more cost and also lose two days of labor. \r\n\r\nHer monthly income from the existing business is 5,000 rupees. Out of this income, she hardly manages her household expenses and business investment. Therefore, she wants to increase stock of her business for more income. The present loan amount of Kabita will be utilized to purchase items like chili, coriander, cumin seeds, etc., in bulk to keep the stock for a month. This will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs, as she will replenish her stock frequently from the nearest market, and she can add a substantial income to her present income. \r\n\r\nKabita hopes to purchase a bike to run her business smoothly with sufficient items, and wants to develop her business into a wholesale shop. She is also planning to give a better education to her only girl child. \r\n\r\nOut of the other nine members of the group, five members are doing dry food businesses like the selling of puffed rice; three members are doing vegetable cultivation; and one member is running a general grocery shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1744514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for the purchasing of chili, coriander, cumin seeds, etc., in bulk to keep the stock for a month.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TETELKHUNTI, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T16:20:04Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayanti       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gomati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gunamati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hasita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kabita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kshetasuta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rakshi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sukanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-24T04:42:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":805912,"name":"Melanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melanie is 31 years old and has four children.

For this purpose, I always strive to learn as much as possible and always improve. As I grew up, I realized that we have to pay for all the goods in this life, and education is not an exception. The reason why I decided to apply for a Kiva loan is a lack of opportunity to cover the tuition fees at American University of Central Asia.\r\n\r\n\"My parents are divorced, and I live with my mother and sister. My sister is a senior at another university, and I became a freshman this year; it is hard for my mother to cover both tuition fees on her own. The majority of people in Tajikistan are low-income earners, as is my mother, due to the underdeveloped economy of the country. I hope that my strong wish, my enthusiasm, and aspiration for knowing something new, and delivering these ideas for the wellness of the business community in my home country, are essential factors to study at AUCA and go through difficulties in this life.

She has been widowed for a number of years, and is now working hard to support herself and her aging parents. \r\n\r\nDidenia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells surplus clothes for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 1,000 PHP each day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her general store, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan, which she will use to buy grocery items such sacks of rice, charcoal, soda, and other groceries. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings enable Didenia and her parents to meet their daily expenses. She thanks God and you, in advance, for the financial help that will be given to her.\r\n\r\nDidenia hopes to grow her business so she can save for her old age, and support her aging parents. She prays for good health and a happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, John\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 8.75 acres of land and purchase a total of 7 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T17:00:05Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hudson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caleb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen Y","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward I","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":127530,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127530}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-14T10:56:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Courtenay Selden","image":null}},{"id":805924,"name":"Ma.

For ten years he has been actively involved in mixed farming as a source of income. He has a beautiful and supporting wife who helps him with his farm work and domestic chores. His primary source of income is from milk, eggs, maize and some personal business that he does to make ends meet.

When asked what he enjoys about dairy farming he replied that he enjoys \u201cmilking the cows every day in the morning.\u201d \r\nHowever, this humble and honest man faces challenges of not meeting the demand for milk and also not satisfying his ever-increasing client base. That is why he is requesting a loan to buy good-quality breeds of dairy cows. Dairy farming is a very profitable business venture and the demand for milk is always high, being such a popular drink for so many people. Other than increased profits, he will benefit from more cow dung (manure) hence saving more money that could have been used in buying fertilizer.

Other than income from selling eggs and poultry products, Reuben will also get manure to use in his farm; hence, the money that could have been used in buying it will be saved. \r\n\r\nReuben projects that after a few months, he will have more income to buy more poultry and also pay back the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1744599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.21,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.72,"local_amount":8419.74,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8558.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824297},{"amount":35.66,"local_amount":3169.36,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3221.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262612},{"amount":35.66,"local_amount":3169.69,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3221.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264679},{"amount":35.59,"local_amount":3163.97,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3215.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600926},{"amount":31,"local_amount":2817.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2863.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.69,"payment_id":681377780},{"amount":36.54,"local_amount":3343.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3398.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.07,"payment_id":696587434},{"amount":38,"local_amount":3581.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3640.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.29,"payment_id":711505767},{"amount":133.62,"local_amount":12335.46,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12538.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.16,"payment_id":731022558}],"funded_date":"2015-01-14T13:13:01Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":805954,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 39-year-old married man and a father of three children.

I have a big family of six people. We lost my father 11 years ago, so we had hard times with my mother. She is a nurse and works in a public hospital. As I remember, we were always short of money and used to save money on everything. Thanks to God, my elder sister studies at the magistracy and will graduate this year. My second sister is also a student, so I am the third student of our big family. I believe I can change my family\u2019s financial situation and achieve my other goals if I just go through the hardships what we face now.\r\n\r\nTo get a perfect education is the only way to create a comfortable environment for me and my family because it gives you freedom, confidence and bright future. A good education costs time, money and patience. One can\u2019t buy it at once - it comes day by day and stays with you the whole life. Therefore, I entered AUCA, despite financial problems. There are a lot of alumni of this university who were in need, but graduated successfully and changed their lives for better. I will test my strength and I will go on, if the Kiva lenders just believe in me and encourage me as my family.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1744610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Eladia, who is 37, is thus very grateful to those who helped her with said loan, thanks to which she was able to buy sugar, soap, bread, eggs, and other products that were in great demand. It helped her support her family and make her business grow. Eladia has a vision and spares no effort to achieve her goals. She thus asks for a new loan in order to buy fizzy drinks, coffee, toilet tissue, cooking oil, rice, and other products that are in demand. She will have more products to offer this way and will therefore increase her income. When she finishes repaying, she intends to take out another loan, because she wants to keep investing in her business so as to constantly improve her family's standard of living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":930.79,"image":{"id":1737660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eladia Marisela \t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":166.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610605373},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624461893},{"amount":93.53,"local_amount":93.53,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":93.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636864775},{"amount":85.28,"local_amount":85.28,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":85.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649617023},{"amount":81.67,"local_amount":81.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":81.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665097121},{"amount":84.31,"local_amount":84.31,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":84.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681395392},{"amount":83.74,"local_amount":83.74,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696605692},{"amount":83.77,"local_amount":83.77,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711528169},{"amount":84.33,"local_amount":84.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":84.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731044123},{"amount":84.17,"local_amount":84.17,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752133118}],"funded_date":"2015-01-14T08:32:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":800766,"name":"Los Pinos Monquecagua Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Fernando, tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, esta soltero, vive junto a su madre y una hermana y reside en una aldea del municipio de Intibuc\u00e1.

They live in a house made of adobe with a straw roof. It has electricity and running water. His business is fishing from a boat with a net. Fishing on Lake Titicaca is one of the most beautiful fishing traditions; it is small-scale and respectful to the lake and the lake bottom. This tradition consists of throwing into the lake a net that is usually at least 30 meters long. By allowing the net to fall to the bottom and leaving it there for one day to act as a trap, and then simply retrieving it, scraping and destroying the lake bottom is avoided. Only things of the desired size are trapped, according to the thicknes of the net, and they fish only the desired varieties of fish.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to improve his family's quality of life and he wants to expand  his business by fixing his boat and motor, so that it will be safer. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the 6 years that he has been doing this work. \r\n\r\nJose is requesting a loan to buy replacement parts for his boat and fix his motor, so he will

He has been engaged with the business for 6 months, and it was commenced by using his own capital. Previously he ran a motor taxi or \u201cOjek\u201d business. The business of selling petrol was established because he thought that this business was potential enough for him to get extra income, because there is no one who runs the same business in that village. Once every week he usually goes to the town (which is 30 kilometers away from his village) to buy the petrol. Mores distributes it to each through a small bottle averaging 1 liter and then displays them on simple shelves in front of his house.\r\n\r\nDue to the increase of petrol price recently, it has also increased the people's demand around his village on petrol.This has led him to expand the business by selling greater than previously. However, the limitation of capital has become a major issue for him.  Therefore, Mores went to TLM and requested a loan capital of IDR 3,000,000 to buy more liters of petrol to be sold.

Twenty years ago, she started a small shop in her house. Now, with the help of one of her two children and the money she receives from her husband, she has managed to turn the small shop in a proper grocery store, but her plans do not stop there. She wants the business to keep growing and generate more income. She asks for a loan in order to buy more products such as basic grains, refreshing drinks, pastries, etc. The shop will offer a great variety of items and attract more customers. Maribel thinks the loan will be of great help because more products of better quality mean more income and more money to invest back into the shop.
