Kakamega County is located in western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas, and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old-growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping.\r\n\r\nPeter is married and has eight children.  Both he and his wife are farmers. They have been farming for twelve years now, and they are currently keeping dairy cattle, poultry, and fish. \r\n\r\nPeter is excited about beekeeping as it will earn him some income from the sale of honey and provide him with honey for medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is Peter's first loan with Honey Care. He plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to buy more beehives. Peter's hope for the future is to construct rental houses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":11.4,"image":{"id":1723065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To buy beehives and apiary materials for honey production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nambale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T19:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T19:20:14Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":28500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":28500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.4,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-27T10:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611808235}],"funded_date":"2014-11-30T20:09:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":800769,"name":"Juan Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos es un joven de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, el vive con su madre y sus hermanos, Carlos reside en el  en el campo y se dedica a trabajar en la crianza de ganado en una peque\u00f1a hacienda y al jornal de trabajos de agricultura, el cr\u00e9dito lo va a invertir en la compra de toretes que los va a poner en la hacienda donde cuida el ganado y ah\u00ed mismo le hacen tener sus toretes y no lo cobran por la hierba, la aspiraci\u00f3n de Carlos es seguir trabajando y quedarse viviendo en Ecuador ya que su madre es una se\u00f1ora colombiana.","en":"Carlos is 21 years old and lives with his mother and his brothers and sisters.

","en":"Yokubjon is a 30-year-old man. He is married and has one child. He lives with his family and his parents. He says: \"This is common among Muslims, not to leave their parents, as they dedicated their whole lives to raising us.\" He is the breadwinner for his family; his wife is a homemaker and raises their child and manages the home and farm.\r\n\r\nFor financial reasons, Yokubjon was unable to enter university after graduating from high school, so he started to work in agriculture. One day, he was spending time with his friends and his friend Bobur told him about his business fattening and reselling livestock. This idea interested Yokubjon and he used his income from agriculture to purchase two animals. At the moment he is fattening them.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Emmy\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land and purchase a total of five solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1734387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T20:30:06Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lonah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":94920,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-12T04:59:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":806040,"name":"Shaaibu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shaaibu is a maize farmer and a member of Babban Gona.

He owns two acres of farmland where he keeps two cows and ten poultry birds. He has also grown more than 1,000 softwood trees on the farm. Edward bought a motorcycle to help him ferry his produce to the market. He also makes additional income transporting passengers and other goods over short distances. The income he generates from all these activities has enabled him to support his wife, Abigael, and his 4-year-old child who attends school.\r\n \r\nEdward is seeking a loan to purchase a generator that will provide electricity to enhance his farm operations. Edward is one of the many rural smallholder farmers in Kenya who live in off-grid zones. He relies on solar-powered devices for lighting and charging the phone. The major problem he is facing in regards to energy is that solar power is heavily reliant on weather conditions. Nyamira is a rain-fed area where they could go days without clear skies. And, even during the clear skies, solar power is not sufficient for applications that require high power voltage. \r\n\r\nYour loan will transform Edward\u2019s life by providing him with an alternative solution to the energy challenges he is facing. Judging by the number of trees he has planted, Edward is very conscious about the wellbeing of the environment. He will always pick environmental-friendly sources of energy. However, he also needs a source of energy that will give him high output from time to time.

She is married to Hilario, a construction worker, and has three children who are all in High School. She manages her household while operating a business. She works hard to augment their income, in order to meet their daily personal, household needs and to send her children to school. <br \/><br \/>Hilda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities, directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go, to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1000 per day. <br \/><br \/>To help her continue the operation of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 35,000 loan. She will use it to buy grocery items, such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and others. She also sells and delivers chicken to her neighbors. She is positive that the loan will boost her income, as she expands her business. Her earnings help cover the family's daily expenses and send her children to school. She is thanking God and you, in advance, for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given her.<br \/><br \/>Hilda hopes to maintain and grow her business, to give her children a better life. She strives to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies. <br \/><br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

world. Meet Robin, a very jovial and hardworking farmer from the Nyamira region of Kenya. Nyamira is a rain-fed area popularly known for tea and banana farming. With the help of his lovely wife Jacqueline, who he married seven years ago, he is able to successfully run a rural enterprise capitalizing on his 0.5 acre piece of land. The farm consists of his home, one cow, 25 poultry, four goats and over 300 trees. \r\n\r\nRobin is planning to grow his farm business, but the only way he will do this without having to purchase more land is by focussing on poultry. Poultry farming is a very lucrative venture that does not require very much land space to be conducted. Robin is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase more heads of poultry in a bid to boost egg production and ultimately increase his income. \r\n\r\nRobin's family will use the eggs produced to meet both domestic needs and commercial ends.

Tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casado desde hace 38 con la se\u00f1ora Petra; juntos formaron una familia con cinco hijos que actualmente ya son independientes.\n\nTom\u00e1s inici\u00f3 trabajando como chofer de un taxi durante ocho a\u00f1os, sus ahorros fueron constantes porque su sue\u00f1o era comprarse un autom\u00f3vil para tener su propio taxi y dejar de trabajar para alguien m\u00e1s. Lo complicado del proceso, fue conseguir los permisos para transitar libremente como taxista por las comunidades, pero con la ayuda de su hermano, quien tambi\u00e9n forma parte del grupo, consigui\u00f3 el permiso necesario. Hace ocho a\u00f1os que conoce a VisionFund, y est\u00e1 muy agradecido por la confianza y los pr\u00e9stamos que se le han otorgado ya que sin ellos no habr\u00eda sido posible comprar el veh\u00edculo. \n\nYa son 17 a\u00f1os de experiencia tras el volante y trabajando de lunes a viernes desde las 5 am. Sin embargo, hace algunos d\u00edas Tom\u00e1s enferm\u00f3 lo cual le impidi\u00f3 seguir manejando y tuvo que contratar a un empleado.

He is a very hard-working man, always at hand for his family's needs, and has the best disposition to help whoever needs it. He is 56 years old, has been married for 38 years to Petra, and together they made a family with five children who are now all independent. \r\n\r\nTom\u00e1s began working as a taxi driver for eight years. His savings were consistent because his dream was to buy himself a car to have his own taxi and to stop working for someone else. The complicated part of the process was to get the permits to travel freely as a taxi driver throughout the communities but, with the help of his brother, who is also part of the group, he got the necessary permits. Eight years ago, he learned about VisionFund and is very grateful for the confidence and the loans that they have offered him since without them, it would not have been possible to purchase a vehicle. \r\n\r\nHe now has 17 years of experience behind the wheel and is working Monday to Friday starting at 5 AM. However, a few days ago, Tom\u00e1s got sick, which prevented him from continuing to drive and he had to hire an employee. Tom\u00e1s doesn't know how long this period will last, but he is anxious to get back to the streets to work. \"I have spent my whole life in the taxi and this reason I can't be here at home,\" Tom\u00e1s said. His employee has to go to a lot of effort to have good earnings, each week turning in approximately 100 US dollars of earnings. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Tom\u00e1s needs to invest in the purchase of new tires and, if he has extra money, he will change the oil. His dream is to continue with his taxi but he would also like to open a grocery store to have additional income that will help him to pay for the household expenses more easily. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the \"Abarroteros\" group also need to invest in their businesses: J. Cruz in repairs for his taxi, and Ambrosio in his small grocery store. Along with Tom\u00e1s, they are very grateful for their loans because their businesses have grown and their families' quality of life has improved. \r\n\r\nThe photo was taken at a fountain, which is at the heart of the municipal garden.

Beatrice also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Beatrice's Group will be able to receive a total of 8 solar lights, as well as farming inputs for planting a total of 5 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1741181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost-efficient maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T22:20:06Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kelesensia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":85570,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85570}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-13T16:04:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tom D"}},{"id":801302,"name":"Rogelia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rogelia es divorciada, tiene una hija y vive en La Paz en una casa de acabado fino donde paga un anticretico Rogelia se gana la vida comercializando artesanias en ferias locales Rogelia quiere un credito para incrementar el numero de artesanias que vende, ella  recibe asistencia familiar del esposo pero eso no es suficiente Al menos Rogelia y su hija gozan de buena salud y la clienta espera poder acceder al credito ","en":"Rogelia is divorced, she has a daughter and lives in La Paz in a well-finished house where she pays an \"anticr\u00e9tico\" [she pays rent until she has paid off the house cost].

Since then, he has seen his life improve; especially in the sense that he has had a healthier life due to better nutrition ever since. This year he decided to represent his group because he wants to spread the story of One Acre Fund farmers.\r\n\r\nAlfred\u2019s Group will receive farming inputs to plant a total of 8.5 acres of land. Additionally, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light, so with this loan, the group will also receive a total of 8 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1741192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T22:30:06Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wellington","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":119500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":806133,"name":"Muqadas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muqadas, a 22-year-old vigorous married mother of two children, knows the art of making beautiful embroidery patterns with beads and pearls and has had a hand-embroidery business for many years.

He hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile and has one of the best weather patterns on earth for farming.  Nicodemus is still single and has so much that he wants to achieve before starting a family.  That is why he is focused and dreaming of being successful.  Nicodemus never got the chance to go to college because of lack of fees, but this never killed the zeal that he had for succeeding, and he started farming five years ago on a small plot of farmland that he inherited from his parents. \r\n\r\nThrough hard work he has managed to practice crop farming and animal farming, and has been able to take care of his parents and also take care of his basic needs.  Nicodemus grows vegetables, fruits and keeps dairy cows as a source of income.  Although Nicodemus has been making profits, he is challenged by timely delivery of products to the market.  This has made his profits go down, because goods reach the market when they are not fresh and hence fetch lower prices.  \r\n\r\nNicodemus comes from an area that has poor feeder roads and this has been a major problem to him. That is why he is seeking a loan of KES 65,000 to buy a motorbike.  With the motorbike, Nicodemus will be able to transport his farm produce to the market and deliver it in a timely manner, and hence it will fetch higher prices.

It is a touristy place, with diverse waterfalls, inns, and a marvelous climate. Here we find in the waterfall of love an agreeable place to spend good times with the family.\r\n\r\nOrfa lives and has her business in this canton. She is a 55 year old fighting woman. She is a single mother with 4 children. The oldest is 33 years old and the last born is 13 years old, dependent, and he lives with her. \r\n\r\nThey have a small general grocery store. She learned this activity through her own initiative when she separated and had to face life alone with her young children. Thanks to her great effort and dedication she could get ahead and support her children, preparing them so they would not have the same problems as her. She comes from a humble family with low income and only attended primary school.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan in order to invest in the business, fixing up and expanding the store. This new investment will improve her income so she can continue supporting the last of her children. Orfa is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternative and Kiva for the support and opportunity provided.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1737708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to invest in and expand her business, increasing her income so she can offer better opportunities in life to her younger son","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2014-11-30T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-14T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orfa Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1104.69,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":74.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":93.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":99.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":104.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":254.94,"local_amount":250.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":254.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610558619},{"amount":88.14,"local_amount":86.55,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":88.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636217509},{"amount":179.9,"local_amount":176.65,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":179.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649567908},{"amount":602.02,"local_amount":591.15,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":602.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347775}],"funded_date":"2015-01-14T01:49:32Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:50:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":806149,"name":"Naseem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naseem is a 40-year-old married woman and the mother of 3 children.

Ella se ha dedicado a vender carne de pollo desde hace ya 12 a\u00f1os aunque por temporadas tambi\u00e9n vende pollo asado, dulces, accesorios para el cabello e incluso prepara pasta de mole para que las personas puedan preparar el tradicional platillo mexicano. Siempre dispuesta a ofrecer el mejor servicio a sus clientes, Evarista se levanta todos los d\u00edas a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para comenzar a limpiar el pollo y as\u00ed a las 6:30 est\u00e1 lista para recibir a su primer cliente. Por lo general, la carne de los pollos que limpia en la ma\u00f1ana se termina en cuesti\u00f3n de horas, pero si por la tarde, una persona llega a su casa para comprar, sin problemas ella limpia el animal y prepara la carne para entregarla. Evarista vende de 7 a 10 pollos diario.\n\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Evarista de su comunidad es la fiesta del 12 de diciembre, d\u00eda en que se celebra a la Virgen de Guadalupe y puede aprovechar para vender aun m\u00e1s pollo. Las personas aprovechan la fecha religiosa para organizar bautismos, matrimonios colectivos, primeras comuniones, confirmaciones y con ello fiestas donde invitan a toda su familia. En muchos casos el pollo es parte elemental de la comida. En este d\u00eda, Evarista ha vendido hasta 72 pollos.\n\nLos pr\u00e9stamos otorgados por VisionFund le han sido de gran ayuda ya que tiene la posibilidad de invertir en su negocio, por ejemplo, actualmente necesita comprar 24 pollos y bolsas de pl\u00e1stico que utiliza para entregar su producto. En su comunidad, la temporada de zafra (corte de ca\u00f1a) se acerca y la econom\u00eda del lugar prospera, sabe que tiene que estar preparada con suficiente carne para satisfacer a sus clientes. \"Espero poder vender pollos asados a la le\u00f1a, acompa\u00f1ados con arroz y salsa cada fin de semana mientras dure la zafra\", de esta manera las ganancias e inversi\u00f3n incrementar\u00e1n y dar\u00e1 mayor estabilidad a su negocio.\n\nLo que jam\u00e1s olvidar\u00e1 Evarista son las palabras de una de sus hijas \u201cGracias por todo lo que me has dado\" y ella sabe que no ha sido f\u00e1cil, pero su esfuerzo y las inversiones le han ayudado a mantener su negocio.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en uno de los nacimientos de agua de la comunidad, lugar que eligieron las clientas, do\u00f1a Evarista viste de blusa amarilla.","en":"Surrounded by hills and rivers lies the community where the \"El Castillo 2\" group was formed. Its members have different economic activities from which they generate income to cover their home expenses:\r\n\r\nAlicia -- Sale of plants and fertilizer\r\nMinerva -- Sale of chickens\r\nMargarita -- Sale of cosmetics\r\nEvarista -- Sale of chickens\r\nJessica -- Sale of soft drinks\r\nEduardo -- Sale of corn and fertilizers\r\nLidia -- Sale of desserts\r\nMariela -- Sale of shoes\r\nLizeth -- Sale of clothes\r\nRebeca -- Sale of bread\r\n\r\nEvarista is married to Domingo. They have a son and a daughter who work in the capital. She has been selling chicken meat for 12 years, even though at times she also sells roasted chicken, hair accessories and even makes mole paste so that people can prepare the traditional Mexican dish. She is always ready to provide the best possible service to her clients. Evarista wakes up at 5:00 a.m. every day to begin cleaning the chickens -- that way she is ready to receive her first customers at 6:30 a.m. Generally, the chicken meat that she cleans in the morning sells out in a matter of hours. However, if somebody arrives at her house to buy meat, she has no problem cleaning the animal and preparing the meat. Evarista sells from 7 to 10 chickens per day. \r\n\r\nWhat Evarista most likes about her community is the December 12 Virgin of Guadalupe celebration. That day, she can sell even more chickens. People organize baptisms, collective weddings, first communions, and confirmations on the day of that religious event. There are usually parties where people invite their whole families. Chicken is usually an essential part of the dishes. Evarista has sold up to  72 chickens on that day. \r\n\r\nThe loans provided by VisionFund have been of great help, as they allow her the opportunity to invest in her business. For instance, she currently needs to buy 24 chickens and plastic bags that she uses to package her products. In her community, the cane cutting season is approaching and the local economy will prosper. She knows that she will have to be prepared with enough meat to satisfy her customers. \"I hope to be able to sell roasted chickens, accompanied by rice and salsa every weekend during the cane cutting season\". This will allow her profits and investment to increase, which will provide more stability to her business. \r\n\r\nEvarista will never forget the words of her daughter: \"Thank you for all that you have given me\" and she knows that it has not been easy, but her effort and investments have helped her maintain her business.\r\n\r\n* The photo was taken in one of the community's river sources.

acercarse a VisionFund para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo e invertirlo en sus actividades. La comunidad donde se ubica la asociaci\u00f3n es productora de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, por ello, la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedica a trabajar en el campo: preparando el suelo para sembrar ca\u00f1a, cuidando el crecimiento de esta y cort\u00e1ndola en \u00e9poca de zafra (cosecha). Durante los 6 meses de corte, los 4 ingenios (f\u00e1bricas azucareras) cercanos a la comunidad silban tres veces al d\u00eda anunciando el cambio de turno de los empleados. \n\nLas integrantes del grupo son:\nJessica \u2013Venta De Agua Purificada\nMirna \u2013Venta De Comida, Videojuegos.\nAda Luz -Venta De Cosm\u00e9ticos Y Toper.\nTeodora - Venta De Cosm\u00e9ticos.\n\nEllas han formado una familia unida por lazos de amistad, la cual les ha permitido apoyarse en momentos dif\u00edciles. Mirna, mejor conocida como \"La Nena\u201d es una mujer muy trabajadora, honrada, amable, sencilla, carism\u00e1tica, alegre, es madre de una joven y de un adolescente. \n\nMirna est\u00e1 casada con Daniel quien la motiv\u00f3 a iniciar con la venta de comida, al principio \u00fanicamente vend\u00eda los fines de semana, pero con el paso de los meses y contando con el apoyo de su familia, en su garaje abri\u00f3 una fonda. Actualmente, atiende a sus clientes de lunes a viernes de 8 de la ma\u00f1ana a 9 de la noche y los estudiantes de la comunidad son quienes m\u00e1s llenan las mesas del peque\u00f1o restaurante. La Nena tambi\u00e9n prepara almuerzos para los hijos de sus amigas y entrega otros pedidos de comida por lo cual tambi\u00e9n recibe un poco de dinero. Su gran reto es atender a los clientes que llegan al lugar y entregar los pedidos siempre a tiempo.\n\nHace apenas 4 meses Mirna decidi\u00f3 rentar videojuegos en el mismo local, animada por su hijo invirti\u00f3 sus ahorros en la compra de dos consolas, controles y juegos. Siempre innovando y en busca de mejorar, Mirna ha decidido comenzar a vender licuados por lo que quiere invertir un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar pl\u00e1tanos, fresas y chocolate en polvo. Tambi\u00e9n necesita comprar m\u00e1s ingredientes para seguir preparando desayunos; los ingredientes que m\u00e1s ocupa son carne, pan, pi\u00f1a, mayonesa, jam\u00f3n, lechuga y queso.\n\nCon las ganancias obtenidas Mirna continuar\u00e1 ahorrando y reinvirtiendo en su negocio especialmente para pagar anuncios de publicidad en la radio local de la comunidad, pues aunque muchos saben de su negocio ella espera lograr que m\u00e1s personas disfruten de su comida. De igual manera continuar\u00e1 dando estudios a su hija quien tiene 16 a\u00f1os y a su hijo de 10, pues esta es la mejor herencia de un padre.\n\n*La imagen se tom\u00f3 en el patio trasero de la casa de Mirna quien viste de blusa a rayas.\n","en":"'Los Portales' is the name chosen by the members of this group when they approached VisionFund to ask for a loan to invest in their activities. The community where the association is located produces sugarcane, so, most of the people there work in the fields, preparing the soil for planting cane, making sure the crops grow healthy, and cutting cane during the harvest season. During the six months of cutting, there are 4 mills (sugar factories) nearby the community that blow their whistle three times a day to announce the change of shift of their employees.\r\n\r\nThe team has 4 members:\r\nJessica - Sells Purified Water\r\nMirna - Sells Food and Video Games.\r\nAda Luz - Sells Cosmetics and Tupperware.\r\nTeodora - Sells Cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThey have formed a strong family-like bond united by their friendship, which has allowed them to rely on each other during hard times. Mirna, better known as \"La Nena\" is a hardworking, honest, friendly, simple, charismatic, cheerful, mother of a young woman and a teenager.\r\n\r\nMirna is married to Daniel who encouraged her to start selling food. Initially, she sold meals only on the weekends, but over the months and with the support of her family, she opened a diner in her garage. She now serves her customers Monday through Friday from 8am to 9pm and students in the community are the most frequent customers at her small restaurant. La Nena also prepares lunch meals for her friends' children and she also takes delivery orders that bring in some more money. Her biggest challenge is to serve her customers coming into the diner and deliver her orders on time. 4 months ago, Mirna decided to expand and start renting video games out of the same location. Encouraged by her son, she invested her savings in two video consoles, joysticks and games. Always innovating and looking for improvement, Mirna decided to start selling smoothies to she wants to invest the loan to buy bananas, strawberries and chocolate powder. She also needs to buy more ingredients to continue preparing breakfast meals; the most important ingredients are meat, bread, pineapple, mayonnaise, ham, lettuce and cheese.\r\n\r\nWith her profits Mirna will continue saving and reinvesting in her business especially to pay for ads in the local community radio station, because even when many know about her business, she hopes to get more people to enjoy her food. No matter the outcome, she will continue sending her 16-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son to school, because that's the best legacy a parent can give their kids.\r\n\r\n*The picture was taken at Mirna's house's backyard.

She was enthusiastic to sell her baked goods to her neighbors and later was able to gain a business customer and expand her customer base to include selling merchandise according to her customer's needs. She makes her sales on credit, which her purchases are cash, so she doesn't make big cash payments as she needs to be sure to recover the money she is owed on credit to be able to satisfy her customers.<br \/><br \/>Today she seeks a loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy finger pastries, accessories, and cake decorations. With this investment she will have the working capital to buy even more and be able to offer her customers what they required, because her greatest challenges is to have sufficient resources to quickly achieve her dream of prosperity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1738578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy finger pastries, accessories, and cake decorations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T01:00:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":55.57,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":51462},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":72006},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":74166},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76391},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78683},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81043},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83475},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85979},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88558},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91215},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93951},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":123071}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":419.43,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1023706.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":55.57,"payment_id":681350273}],"funded_date":"2015-01-11T02:23:38Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:54:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":806188,"name":"Mwanaisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaisha is the married mother of five children, four of whom attend school while one is still too young.

The youngest still lives with her and he is currently going to school. The other two children are studying abroad. She only finished 2nd grade. It was very difficult to go to school when she was young, so she decided to drop out and work to help her family, instead. Her son is the only one living with her and he's her only dependent.\r\nRosa sells and breeds chicken. She buys them small, and grows them, and then sells them clean ready for cooking. Despite receiving financial support from her children, she's always liked to work, so she decided to open a farm out of her home, and now she sells about 100 chicken a month. She takes care of all activities related to the production of the chicken and she also takes care of the orders. When she has no orders to cover, she pays one of her sisters to sell them door to door.\r\nThe loan will be used to buy 100 chicken, a day old, to develop them and get them ready and available for New Year's Eve celebrations, so she can meet the demand for that date. Rosa's biggest wish is for God to grant her a long, healthy life to keep working on what she likes to do and always have what she needs to maintain her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1738584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a hundred chicken","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T01:20:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":760,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":63.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":65.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":67.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":76.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.57,"local_amount":54.49,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":55.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595146205},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":53.73,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":54.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611769720},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":57.22,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":58.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624833348},{"amount":606.29,"local_amount":594.56,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:02:12Z","rounded_local_amount":606.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636201102}],"funded_date":"2014-12-01T19:11:44Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T12:02:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jimena Lopez","image":249667}},{"id":806215,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is a 33-year-old single man with four children living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

She is 44 years old, married, and has three children. She lives with her family in their own house in a poor area. Alia has been selling perfumes and incense door-to-door for more than seven years.

She sells crafts made out of plastic. She is business-minded, independent, responsible, reliable, active and hardworking. She works in Miraflores, a residential area characterized by its central location in the city, with cold, dry weather with average temperatures between 4-21 degrees Celsius, that vary during the day. Maribel has dark skin, with long, brown hair, medium height, her mother tongue is Aymara, her family language, but she speaks Spanish when she works (in the picture: front row, center, wears a black jacket and has a hand in her pocket). She shares her life with her brother. They live in a brick house they rent, and they have water and electricity. The need to improve her quality of life led her to form a banking community group with other business owners. They sell soft drinks, books, clothes, fruit, tomatoes, fish, and one of them makes apparel clothing. Together, they asked for a loan to expand their businesses. Maribel sells plastic crafts such are holidays items (she uses large plastic bottles to make Easter baskets), bottle vases (she turns plastic bottles into flowers vases), outdoor crafts (soda bottle birdfeeders) etc., and she also makes woven plastic items such as bags, purses and different decorative objects or fashion accessories. Her business is creative and very unique in the market, so she has clients that hire her to decorate their stores, among others. 'The good thing about my business is that I'm constantly travel to offer my products to customers everywhere and they always end up buying something...' she says. Her dream is to become known throughout the country as a designer and she wants to expand her business by purchasing recycled plastic in bulk. This is the second cycle of loans with this association in three years of doing this activity. This is the reason why Maribel is asking for a loan to buy recycled plastics wholesale to expand her business and distribute her art."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1738558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy recycled plastics wholesale to expand her business and distribute her art.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erasmo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edgar Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1730.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2139.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2169.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2200.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2231.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2263.44},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2295.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2328.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2361.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2395.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2429.18},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2456.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":319.87},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":324.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":877.84,"local_amount":6038.62,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6065.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157393},{"amount":644.29,"local_amount":4432.04,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4451.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554299},{"amount":662.76,"local_amount":4559.1,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4579.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226838},{"amount":681.76,"local_amount":4689.81,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4710.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214016},{"amount":1058.35,"local_amount":7280.43,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7312.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564146}],"funded_date":"2014-12-19T16:18:00Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jimena Lopez","image":249667}},{"id":803099,"name":"Fatou's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe  a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place durant le second semestre de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013.

to Peter referring to the different breeds of dairy cows on his compound, one would mistake him for an Agricultural Extension Officer. Peter, from a remote town in Kenya, is an active and progressive farmer of his locality. He has a wife and seven children, and together they live on a small piece of land. Traditionally, his primary source of income has been milk, crops and personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 15 years. Having farmed for such a long time, he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. \r\n\r\nKenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture; particularly the Nandi tribe (Peter's tribe), where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high, and Peter wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya, and Peter has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. Peter always says that, \u201cto become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d \r\n\r\nHe has planted many trees on his farm, and dairy food will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan, Peter will not only benefit from milk but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. \r\n\r\nPeter has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Peter chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Peter underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and during the training season, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. \r\n\r\nThrough accumulated profits, Peter plans to permanently improve his living conditions and secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. He plans that through increased income he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a biogas digester, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1744878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T02:20:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2936.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3022.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3110.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3201.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3294.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3391.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3490.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3592.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3697.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3805.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3916.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4031.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4148.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4270.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4394.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4523.43},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4655.62},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.47},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.85},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":806244,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is a humble farmer who goes to work on his farm every morning. He is dedicated in full to his work. This man only thinks about going forward and delivering good products. He knows that many people consume his products, and because of this, every drop of sweat that comes from his forehead is the determination that he puts in so that his products are pure and of good quality. \r\n\r\nHe is a 41-year-old farmer from Kiplombe village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and three children on a small piece of land where he keeps cows and grows a wide variety of crops. For ten years, his primary sources of income have been milk and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. \r\n\r\nJoseph made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime this month, he applied for a loan to expand his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, Joseph's children will acquire quality education that will act as a strong foundation for their bright future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1744879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand his horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":2561.62,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2700.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194786},{"amount":24.4,"local_amount":2091.2,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2204.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824315},{"amount":25.21,"local_amount":2160.46,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2277.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262613},{"amount":270.5,"local_amount":23186.72,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":24440.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264688}],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T22:10:15Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":806245,"name":"Dritan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dritan is 33 and a father of two children who are nine and five years old.

She always saw her family making a living through commercial activities and that led to most of her experience. Seven years ago, in 2007, she decided to undertake her own business venture in order to be able to live independently, and she began to sell men's and women's clothing.\r\n\r\nHer business began to grow little by little through a system of offering her products on credit which adapts to her customers' possibilities of buying. Her customers mainly live in the area in which she is located. Her goal is to have a department store and attract her own clientele.

A pesar de la lluvia Alicia no deja de trabajar ya que es su \u00fanico ingreso para sustentar su peque\u00f1o hogar; por ello Alicia acude a la Fundaci\u00f3n, ya que solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de una carpa m\u00e1s grande para su negocio y poder atender mejor a su clientela, tambi\u00e9n va a comprar un cilindro de gas necesario para su trabajo diario.\nSe siente enormemente agradecida porque son pocas las instituciones que ayudan con peque\u00f1os cr\u00e9ditos para poder superarse.

She lives with her young son in the city of Santo Domingo de los Colorados in a small rented house in this beautiful city.\r\n\r\nAlicia is a hardworking mother. In the morning, she is with her small child. Beginning at 3 pm, she goes on a busy corner selling salchipapas [a local street food of sausages and french fries]. She takes a car everyday to sell her products. Alicia does not stop working even in the rainy season because it is the only income to support her small household. This is why Alicia went to the foundation to request a loan to purchase a larger tent for her business to better serve her clientele and a cylinder of gas necessary for her daily work.\r\n\r\nShe feels enormously grateful because few institutions provide small loans to help people succeed. Alicia says she will always try to get ahead and will continue to work with this institution.

Her potential sales increase during the last months of the year, because the celebrations of school promotions, marriages, first communions, and family parties for Christmas and New Year's thus need them. For that reason, her clientele is greater and her capacity to respond isn't sufficient to satisfy them. Usually her investments occur before the year ends, and that is the reason why she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy chairs and tables. Thus the opportunity to rent these furnishings is greater, and they will improve her income.\r\n\r\nBerta has had her business for 15  years. She still remembers when she started it in the year 1999, after learning the art of interior decorating and observing the great demand and the little offering of this service, which even the academies require for training. Alert to this circumstance, she turned to her husband, who gave her the seed capital to begin. Now her business is very well used, and it is known around the area where she lives, from which her requests for service come. Lately she added to her service the rental of washing machines, to increase her opportunities for income, and thus it is that now she has five washing machines for this. Her goal for the future is to make her house a two-story house, in order to make her business independent of her family life and increase the tranquility so much desired by her and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":243.81,"image":{"id":1738591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative

Naomi, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to expand her farmland and hopes to ensure her children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1655292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy food and clothing, thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn at low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T05:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T05:00:08Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":13312,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13312}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-01T14:31:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":801400,"name":"Mauricio Felipe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mauricio es un hombre de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja, tiene un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os y trabaja como empleado archivista en una compa\u00f1\u00eda de seguros.\n\u00c9l es buen padre, emprendedor, responsable, inteligente y trabajador.

Ozoda is an energetic and capable woman; she knows how to cut and sew. She has been providing seamstress services and accepting orders for sewing women's dresses for five years already. In Tajikistan women prefer to sew their national dresses to-order, and this is why seamstress services here are very popular. Almost a third of women are involved in this type of service, and Ozoda is no exception. Now Ozoda wants to expand her sewing business.

","en":"Musallama lives in the city of Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. She is married and a mother of two daughters, who are 4 and 2 years old, and a 9-year-old son. Her son attends third grade in a school. Musallama is a seamstress by trade and is involved in the sewing business at her home. Her husband is a migrant worker and often travels to Russia for work. This is how he earns a living in order to provide for his family. And now he is getting ready for another trip, but does not have enough money for the ticket.
