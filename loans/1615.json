Smitanjali is the president of  Maa Santoshi SHG, which consists of nine members. Generally, all the ladies work hard and are busy all the day doing their household chores, but in their free time they used to gossip and pass time. Then Smitanjali thought of forming a group and getting sustainable training through which they could use their free time usefully and also earn some money out of it. Many ladies rejected her idea, but some of the women supported her and formed a SHG (Self Help Group). They decided to get training to make cement vases and idols from their fellow villagers who are already in this work.\r\n\r\nHearing this, all the SHG ladies were reluctant to get the training from men because of social barriers, and even their husbands were against this idea. But Smitanjali made it possible; even in this topsy-turvy situation, she alone took the training and became the master trainer for her SHG members.\r\n\r\nStill, they couldn't start their work because they needed some investment to buy raw materials, and they hesitated to ask for help from their husbands because they were already against their idea. And then, one of the Peoples Forum staff went to their village, and with his help, the Maa Santoshi group could get a loan to invest in their innovation.\r\n\r\nEarlier, all the villagers were teasing them, but gradually they admired their work and supported them. Smitanjali was amazed to see that because she just thought of doing something new or creative apart from their daily household chores. Moreover, the members gained confidence and gave more and more time in the quality and innovative creation of the work.\r\n\r\nTheir goodwill spread to the nearby districts and villages. More and more demand increased for their products; moreover, the dealers paid them well, and they made a pretty good profit out of their pieces of art.\r\n\r\nThey got encouraged day by day, and took skill development training, through which they learned fusion art. According to the market demand, it helped them to create innovative and quality art products.\r\n\r\nEarlier, all the nine members of Maa Santoshi SHG were just simple, shy homemakers, but by the leadership and confidence of Smitanjali, all are now skilled artisans and confident entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nSmitanjali will use her portion to buy cement, colors in bulk and new tools so that she can make more products and can gain more profit.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1729642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy cement, colors in bulk and new tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dhenkanal, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Smitanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Radha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tapaswini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rasmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":135000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T05:17:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":798000,"name":"Maa Tarini Shg (D) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goura is 30 years old, and she is married with two children.

Her husband is a daily wage earner and can earn up to 300 INR in good health. \r\n\r\nHis income was hardly sufficient to meet their family's needs, so Kholboi took the initiative to start her own business and availed herself of a loan from WSDS in 2013 that was invested in weaving. She has skills in weaving since a young age. She designs and weaves beautiful shawls for selling purposes. She also hires two people as helpers and pays them to increase her production, which has been very helpful in her business. The loan helped the family so much, and they are able to pay their fees regularly now, including the children's education fees. She also repaid her loan regularly without any delay. \r\n\r\nShe now aspires to buy one hand loom and employ one more person in her business. With the Kiva loan, she will buy a hand loom and employ one person. She will also buy silk yarn for weaving beautiful shawls. She will also pay her employee monthly as remuneration. The money she gets from her weaving business will be saved up to buy a sofa set for her family. They will be able to sit and relax on the sofa and will spend family time comfortably. \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and excited for the loan and hopes to make maximum utilization of the loan.

She, along with her husband, manages a cultivation farm, where she grows vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, carrots, cabbages, chiles, cucumbers, papaya, ladies finger, onions and maize. She sells her products to the traders of the nearest town, who come to take vegetables from her farm. \r\n\r\nSunita earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from her business. According to her, this scanty income is not at all sufficient to meet the day to day expenses of her family as well as the farm expenses. So Sunita wants to expand her cultivation by adding some advance techniques of farming by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. She has planned to utilize the present loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs like good quality seeds, manure, and pesticides for her farm. She is also planning to purchase a diesel water lifting pump for smooth water supply. She has also planned to take the help of the local agriculture and horticulture departments for crop planning with different schemes and programs meant for farmers. \r\n\r\nShe expects a good return from her business by expanding her cultivation. Sunita dreams to construct a farm house. She also hopes to give her whole family a bright future through her hard work. \r\n\r\nThe other 12 members of this group are also doing vegetable cultivation, a milk business, black gram and green gram cultivation, goat rearing, etc. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1737569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to pay for purchasing fertilizer and farm inputs like good quality seeds, manure,  pesticides and a diesel water pump for her farm.

He fattens cattle for 40-60 days and then sells it at the livestock market at a profitable price. He also has a smallholding where his family is engaged in growing crops.

As the money sent by her husband could not totally meet their needs, she took up earning supplementary income  by weaving shawls. She has been very good at weaving since she was a young lass which led her to choose this occupation for income generation. \r\n\r\nAsha joined the group in the year 2012 and accessed a loan from WSDS to use in her weaving. The loan gave her the opportunity to improve her weaving business a lot. She provides household expenses from the income she generate from weaving. Now she wants to access a loan to buy yarn for weaving lovely shawls and selling them in the market. She wants to produce many lovely shawls that will captivate many customers in the market. By selling shawls, she will get profit that will help her in maintaining the household. \r\n\r\nAsha is very happy and content with the loan. She also thanks Kiva lenders for their generosity.

She is the featured borrower of the group. Chanbi is a very friendly and caring person. She works hard to meet the daily needs of her family. She is very well-mannered with the customers and that is one reason that keeps her business going. She aspires to innovate in her grocery store by selling items that will attract more customers. Customers usually flock to those stores that sell a greater number of items. \r\n\r\nChanbi cannot compete with those stores due to lack of financial resources. With the Kiva loan, she will buy a stock of grocery items to sell in her store. She has high hopes of meeting regular customers' needs and attracting many more customers.

She is a kind wife and a loving mother. Zikamo's children study and work. Zikamo is a wise woman, and it is just a pleasure talking to her. She has been involved in sewing national mattresses, or \"kurpa\" and \"kurpacha\", as they are commonly referred to, for 10 years. \r\n\r\n\"Kurpa' and \"kurpacha\" are cotton-filled mattresses. \"Kurpa\" is customarily sewn in a square form and used as a blanket. Kurpacha are long mattresses used as couches. \"Kurpa\" has been used since ancient times and is still used to this day.

Safura aspires to earn more income as well as to repay this loan and support her family with food and educational materials.\r\n\r\nSafura thanks Kiva lenders for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":1744764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy shea nuts for processing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Bimbilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":346,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T19:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T19:50:13Z","loan_amount":5575,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fuseina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abibata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shanka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rahinatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yampaga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Memunatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zuwera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memunatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memunatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rashida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":17750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":5575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6656.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4437.52},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5546.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1109.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2090.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1393.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1742.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":348.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":5226.59,"local_amount":16640.7,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":16659.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595174636},{"amount":348.41,"local_amount":1109.3,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1110.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610570632}],"funded_date":"2014-12-02T19:42:26Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:54:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":806482,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The borrower is married, lives with his wife and two of his daughters.

","en":"Karomat is 56 years old. She is a smart and hardworking woman, living in the town of Khujand, in the north of Tajikistan. Karomat is involved in her favorite occupation - she sews women's dresses to-order. She inherited this trade in her youth from her mother; however, she started her own sewing business three years ago. Her daughter-in-law, who lives with Karomat's son in her house, helps her with this business.

Meet Fridah, 27 years of age. She is a very dedicated and hard-working woman. She resides in the Chuka area of Kenya.

She always refers to him as \"her heartbeat.\" Fridah has been practicing farming for the past four years and, through hard work and determination, she has been able to support her family and always provide a plate of food for them. Her main sources of income are milk, poultry, crops and some small personal business that she does to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nBecause of harsh living conditions and the lack of employment, Fridah plans to increase her farming output so that she can improve her income and, hence, her living conditions. That is why she is seeking a loan of 10,000 KES to buy farm inputs. Through buying farming inputs, such as good-quality seeds and good fertilizer and pesticide, she will be able to increase her crop output and, hence, improve her income. Fridah is very visionary and enterprising and she hopes that, through improved income, she will be able to save more money. She plans to buy more land and increase her farming in the future. Through this loan, her business will continue to flourish and she will assure her school-going child of uninterrupted learning because she will pay tuition fees on time and also improve her living

lenders, meet Dinah. She is a 26-year-old smallholder farmer based in Kapsowar, which is a small rural town in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Dinah and her husband are blessed to have four children. Dinah has been a mixed-farmer for more than four years. She keeps dairy cows, poultry for eggs and grows maize and vegetables to sell. She also holds a day job and engages in small businesses on the side whenever an opportunity crosses her path. Despite the rapid fluctuation of prices in the market, Dinah is very passionate and optimistic about the future of horticultural farming in Kenya.\n\nDinah is seeking a loan to grow her horticultural farm. This move is quite a big deal for her. With your loan, Dinah seeks to continue growing different varieties of crops, but on a greater scale.

Meet Susan, one of the most hardworking women on earth. She is 38 years of age and ambitious. Susan hails from the Kapsowar area of Kenya, a place known as the \u201cmango region\u201d of Kenya since half of the mangoes that Kenya exports are from this area. \n\nSusan has been farming for the past 10 years, and she has gathered an immense wealth of experience over those years. Because of all her experience, she offers free advice to young and new farmers, and also extends services to her neighbors. \n\nSusan practices mixed farming, and through her ventures she has been able to reap greater profits. But she has not yet reached her maximum potential. \n\nSusan sells vegetables and milk to the nearest market, which is nonetheless far from where she lives, making it a challenge to transport her products there. Her village is not only remote, the infrastructure is also very poor. Susan deals with perishable goods, and therefore she needs to deliver them to the market as quickly as possible. However, the poor roads make this difficult, and her products reach the market very late. They arrive no longer fresh and, hence, fetch a low price. \n\nThis is why Susan is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES. With this loan, Susan will be able to purchase a motorbike which will assist her in delivering her products to the market quickly. Susan is sure that, through the timely delivery of her products, she will earn a maximum profit and be able to support her children and family. \n\nSusan's dream is to continue cultivating her land and selling more produce to the market so that her family will lack nothing. Through the profits she earns Susan will be able to both repay the loan on time and secure the future of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1737420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

One serves in the army, while the other works in a private sector outside the state to generate income. <br \/><br \/>Jano has been in the rice business for the past several years. She buys rice grains at a cheaper rate from the villagers and grinds the grains at the village rice mill. She sells the milled rice grains at the market for a small profit, and sometimes people come to buy rice at her place. The profit she makes from selling the rice is used in maintaining the household expenses. <br \/><br \/>Since they live in a joint family, the household expenses are high, and their household income can hardly meet to their needs. Sometimes they do not get adequate income for the household. Considering their financial condition, Jano wanted to improve her business by selling more varieties of rice so that she could generate more income adequate for the household.  <br \/><br \/>With the Kiva loan, she will buy stock of rice grains from her village neighbours and sell the milled rice at the market. She hopes for a successful business so that she can generate a sufficient amount of income for her family.

She is a wife and mother, and thanks to her parents' efforts, she was able to finish primary school. Later, because of the lack of economic resources, she had to work starting at a very young age in order to supply her needs. Today, Sandra lives with her husband and children in the city of Latacunga, which belongs to the province of Cotopaxi in the Republic of Ecuador. \r\n\r\nSandra works making and selling leather articles. Together with her husband, she has been able to get ahead with her household and her business, which is growing more and more every day. She learned this work from her parents, who helped her with this idea, and it has served to support her family. She sells her products both inside and outside the city. Sandra dedicates herself to this work from 8 to 10 hours every day, in conjunction with her household chores, which include caring for her children. Her small business has been growing day by day, and she now feels prepared to take a step in growth.

Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,000 a day. \n\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan that she will use to buy grocery items such as fresh meat, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expense. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given to her.\n\nMichelle hopes to maintain and grow her business. She also dreams of having a canteen to augment their income so she can save and build their dream house. She prays for a quiet life.

She is employed in a garment factory in Cavite through the auspices of the Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT). Levita works as a seamstress, sewing clothing according to the company or client\u2019s dictates. She uses a sewing machine and other stitching machines as well as handstitching hems and linings.\n\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Levita is meeting family expenses without access to savings or credit. Workers can become heavily indebted to money lenders who take their ATM cards as loan collateral. \n\nFor this reason Levita is asking for your assistance to help her circumvent loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT and had no problem in repaying them since the loan payments were automatically deducted from her paycheck. She is seeking a 10,000 PHP loan to pay for her child\u2019s tuition and to buy direct selling products like cosmetics, clothing, footwear and undergarments she needs to resell.\n\nLevita hopes to give her children good educations. She looks forward to your positive response and says any amount will surely be of great help. \n\nCCT works to provide local communities with a trained labor force and equipped with the skills required for employment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative assists its members in acquiring those skills necessary for quality jobs, cultivating savings consciousness and providing decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs include Professional Staff Services, Workers Guild Development, Enterprise Development and Consultancy Services.\n\nCCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for factory workers such as Levita before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and after-work hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1739953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for her child\u2019s tuition and to buy merchandise she needs in her direct selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T21:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T21:20:09Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Levita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3371.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134396},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757164},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200302},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186590},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535668}],"funded_date":"2014-12-02T14:46:54Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":802379,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa is 42 years old and single.\n\nShe is in the agricultural business pig fattening in the Philippines.

She has also previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative and she had no problem in repaying since the loan payment is being deducted every pay day. She looks forward for your positive response and any amount coming from you will surely be of great help.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Patrick\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 4.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 7 solar lights.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1742405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T21:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T21:30:16Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gibert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julias A","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycllife","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":77250,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":801490,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":582.91,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cooking ingredients in bulk to sell oven-roasted food and baked dough.

She is requesting an amount of 9,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy greater quantities and varieties of ornamental plants such as ylang-ylang, golden shower, dahlias and various hanging plants.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to give her children a good quality education. She also dreams of having a bigger and better space for her ornamental plants. She meets up with her fellowship group* every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1665448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for fertilizer and garden inputs she needs for her business to keep going even this rainy season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T21:40:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3369.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134456},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2695.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757225},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200363},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186646}],"funded_date":"2014-12-02T00:15:43Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":802556,"name":"Ronelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronelyn is married and she works hard to support her family.\n\nShe has a vegetable vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from farming sugarcane and a general store business.

Meet Romana, 41 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kesses, a remote village in Eldoret. She is happily married and is blessed with six adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last fifteen years and has gained so much experience. <br \/><br \/>To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. <br \/><br \/>The Eldoret area is very populated, and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. <br \/><br \/>Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. <br \/><br \/>Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":287.65,"image":{"id":1745362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-01T21:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-15T21:50:12Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.15,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.77,"local_amount":4180.07,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4406.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824323},{"amount":53.96,"local_amount":4625.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4875.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264692},{"amount":26.33,"local_amount":2256.71,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2378.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459354},{"amount":28.56,"local_amount":2501.88,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2637.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":681377787},{"amount":28.92,"local_amount":2551.68,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2689.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":696587444},{"amount":93.96,"local_amount":8540.13,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":9002.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.67,"payment_id":711505773}],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T06:16:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":806683,"name":"Fridah's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fridah is a 66-year-old proud mother of 8 children.

a youthful 20-year-old mother, is a wise farmer who is respected by her neighbors and fellow farmers as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, which in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Mercy is happily married and is blessed with one lovely child. \r\n\r\nFor the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming and she grows maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Mercy has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with a challenge of delivering the produce to the market in a timely manner. This challenge has not made her give up and she states, \u201cI have to do something for my family.\u201c \r\n\r\nMercy joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like Mercy. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Mercy is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (e.g., milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Mercy to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Mercy feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Mercy will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. \r\n\r\nMercy is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Mercy will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her child of uninterrupted education and a secure future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1745387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

This is his story:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"It is my curiosity that has guided me in learning this art and honing my skills. I got interested in wood carving when I was a child, when I used to visit my brother Salihu's workshop. I would go to his workshop when I returned from school and try my hands at sanding masks. When I completed junior high school, my parents could not further my education and so I joined Salihu at his workshop. I got paid for the work I did, which I saved to be able to buy my own tools. After 12 years of working with my brother I started to work on my own. I have taught other carvers, and currently have four carvers working with me. I love the art of mixing colors and fixing aluminum plates to design an item. My hope is to become successful and be able to assist several people who cannot further their education due to financial constraints.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for this opportunity.

She has two children; her oldest is 6, and her youngest is 5.  For 3 years, Shamigul has dealt in cattle for a living, typically buying cow and bull calves then reselling them at a cattle market for a profit after they've been fattened.  This provides Shamigul and her family with a very important source of income, and her husband helps her accordingly.  Shamigul is seeking a loan to buy more livestock so she can expand her business, increase her income and thus be able to save money for her children's education.  Her children will be starting school soon, and she needs to buy textbooks, uniforms and other school supplies for their studies.  Shamigul needs to have more animals on her farm to grow her business, and hopes she'll get the help she needs.

She is married to Maximo, and they are working hard to provide for their everyday needs and expenses.\r\n\r\nMarcel operates a food stall where she sells siomai. Siomai is an Asian delicacy that originated in China.  It is a piece of meat, either chicken, pork or beef, stuffed inside a wonton wrapper and cooked by steaming. Often eaten with lemon or calamansi with a dash of soy sauce, siomai is sold on almost every corner in different cities. \r\n\r\nThe siomai business is a good business today.  Filipinos love \u201cpica foods,\u201d or finger food, snacks. It is a mass favorite since it is easy to eat and more importantly it is affordable. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. \r\n\r\nAside from siomai, she also has siopao, fishballs, kikiam, fries, and other common Filipino street foods. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy raw ingredients needed in her siomai business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMarcel hopes that her children will have a good life.  That is why she is unwaveringly supporting their educational needs. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.  It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is 33 years old, married, and the mother of three children who all go to school.  She has a 13-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 10 and 6.  Nargiz is a very good and hardworking woman. She always works hard and does everything she can to provide the best to her family and children.  For the past five years already, she has been taking orders and sewing women's clothes at home.

Sarah and her husband are blessed with a child. Sarah has been a farmer for more than 4 years. She keeps poultry for eggs and grows tea and vegetables for sale. She also holds a day job and engages in small businesses on the side whenever an opportunity crosses her path. Despite the rapid fluctuation of prices in the market, Sarah is very passionate and optimistic about the future of farming in Kenya. \n\nSarah is seeking a loan to expand her farm. She intends to buy good quality seeds and fertilizer. This move is quite a big deal for her. With a loan, Sarah seeks to continue growing a variety of crops but on a greater scale.

The income from her business is very small and is not enough for her to live decently. She would also like to be able to help raise her grandchildren. In order to expand her business, Tansyk applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai-Tushum Bank to buy eight sheep to fatten and sell. She plans to use the income from the sales to invest in additional livestock in order to improve her financial situation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1726006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase eight sheep to fatten and sell in order to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Internatsionalnoe village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tansyk","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3540},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3643},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3749},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3859},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4087},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4206},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4329},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4455},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4585},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4719},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4857}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.53},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.7,"local_amount":7183,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7237.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436575},{"amount":65.61,"local_amount":3749,"processed_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3777.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751556},{"amount":67.53,"local_amount":3859,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3888.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799264},{"amount":68.98,"local_amount":3971,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4001.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":636161417},{"amount":71.52,"local_amount":4087,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4118.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513816},{"amount":73.61,"local_amount":4206,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4238.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995570},{"amount":75.76,"local_amount":4329,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4362.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681290976},{"amount":77.96,"local_amount":4455,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4488.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500208},{"amount":75.7,"local_amount":4585,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4619.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.54,"payment_id":711411162},{"amount":76.27,"local_amount":4719,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4755,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.31,"payment_id":730933423},{"amount":74.84,"local_amount":4857,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4894.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.16,"payment_id":752025449}],"funded_date":"2014-12-10T23:20:11Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:02:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}}]}
