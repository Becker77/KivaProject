Mirgul became involved in animal husbandry in 1996.  Today she owns two cows, 20 sheep and one horse, as well as two hectares of land on which she grows corn and potatoes.  In order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy an additional cow for breeding.  An increase in the number of her farm animals will directly lead to an increase in the family's capital.  Mirgul is a member of the \"Nichkesai\" group, which, in addition to herself, consists of three more people.  She is planning to reinvest her earnings from this loan into increasing her herd and she would also like to save enough money to repair her house.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":577.5,"image":{"id":1726701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a cow in order to increase her livestock headcount.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nichkesai village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T00:20:04Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.51,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16500},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16500},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":17000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":288.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":288.75,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":16625.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513823},{"amount":254.24,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":16625.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":34.51,"payment_id":752025454}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T23:13:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":806747,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia is 60 years old.

","en":"Minaiym is 56 years old and a widow.  She is raising three children.  Her two older children are already living independently, but her youngest daughter is still at home and a student.  Minaiym herself has the equivalent of a high school education.  She knows how to properly handle money and to make financial plans in order to achieve the goals that she has set for herself.  She is now a pensioner but is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which constitutes her family's main source of income.  She started in this field 14 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two cows, and she has everything she needs to take care of cattle: a barn and some land for pasture.  Minaiym's income is very small and vastly insufficient to provide a decent life and to take care of the children's upbringing.  For this reason, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy four young bulls as well as animal feed.  The earnings from her loan will enable Minaiym to grow her business, build some assets and improve her living conditions.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1878.63,"image":{"id":1726708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase animal feed as well as four young bulls for fattening and resale, so that she can increase her income.

She was recently awarded Zambia\u2019s Top Female Entrepreneur, which gave her the opportunity to travel to the Washington, DC for the first time where she took part in a mentorship program. She encourages lenders to continue supporting small business entrepreneurs like herself.\n\nNow that Misozi has successfully paid back her 3 previous loans, she is requesting a fourth loan to continue growing her mobile money business. With this loan, she will be able to service more customers in a community that needs financial services.

Su labor la realiza en un mercado de su ciudad, caracterizado por comercio mayorista; donde productores en todas las \u00e1reas de manera desorganizada se agrupan d\u00eda a d\u00eda para ofrecer sus productos a la venta en grandes cantidades.\nSilvia es de tez morena, cabello negro como la noche, su lengua materna es el Quechua y habla espa\u00f1ol por razones de comercio. Su vida la realiza con su pareja que se dedica a la construcci\u00f3n, viven en una habitaci\u00f3n en alquiler y comparten el ba\u00f1o y la cocina con otros vecinos (la segunda de la izquierda, blusa negra, pantalon blanco). Debido a la necesidad de conseguir una mejor manera de vivir, form\u00f3 una banca de personas con negocios como; tejido de ropa de bebe, venta de papas fritas, venta de ropa deportiva, tienda de barrio, carnicer\u00eda, venta de videos y venta de s\u00e1ndwiches, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en sus negocios. Su negocio es la venta de Api (desayuno de ma\u00edz morado); Cuando la ciudad todav\u00eda duerme y el manto oscuro de la noche est\u00e1 a punto de levantarse para que se inicie un nuevo d\u00eda, Silvia trabaja desde que tenia 10 a\u00f1os de edad y cada dia empieza su jornada en el mercado a la intemperie, en la capital cruce\u00f1a y ella sabe que los comensales que habitualmente acuden a su puesto para desayunar no le pedir\u00e1n caf\u00e9, leche o t\u00e9, sino que, como ya es habitual en esta \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o, buscar\u00e1n el api que prepara y que, a decir de uno de sus clientes, \u2018solo ella sabe hacer bien\u2019. En una olla grande hace hervir el agua y va sumando los ingredientes hasta lograr el espeso l\u00edquido de color morado que luego ser\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado con empanadas fritas y sopaipillas (pan de queso frito). Cerca de las 10:00 ya no queda ni para llenar una taza. \u201cA veces tengo que hacer dos ollas, porque en invierno es lo que m\u00e1s buscan\u201d, comenta la cocinera con la seguridad que le dan 11 a\u00f1os de trabajar en el mercado y de preparar la popular bebida caliente. Nadie puede discutir que el brebaje hecho del ma\u00edz morado o culli, como es tambi\u00e9n conocido, ha logrado imponerse en todo el pa\u00eds.\nEsta es la segunda secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n. Su sue\u00f1o es tener un negocio estable y fijo, donde pueda trabajar c\u00f3modamente, ella desea realizar la ampliaci\u00f3n de su negocio mediante la compra de utensilios de cocina como tambi\u00e9n una cocina nueva.\nEs por esos motivos que Silvia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de utensilios de cocina y una cocina nueva para atender a mayor cantidad de clientes.\n","en":"Silvia, a 21-year-old woman, lives with her partner, has no children and has a business selling breakfasts. She is a dreamer and is independent, optimistic, active, steady, responsible and hard-working. She works in one of the markets in her city, which is for wholesale trade. Here producers of all types get together in a haphazard way every day to offer their products for sale in large quantities. \r\n\r\nSilvia is dark skinned and has hair as black as the night. Her mother tongue is Quechua and she speaks Spanish for business purposes. She lives with her partner who works in construction. They live in a rented room and share the bathroom and kitchen with other neighbours. She is the second from the left in the photo in the black blouse and white trousers.\r\n\r\nBecause of the need to find a better way of living, she set up a communal bank of people with businesses such as: knitting baby clothes, selling chips, selling sportswear, local shop, butcher's, video sales and sandwich sales, in order to ask for a loan to invest in their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling 'Api' (a breakfast dish made of purple corn). When all the city is still asleep and the dark blanket of the night is about to lift away so that a new day can begin, Silvia starts her day in the market out in the open, in the capital of Santa Cruz, and she knows that the diners who regularly visit her stall to have breakfast won't ask for coffee, milk or tea, but, as is usual at this time of year, they will be looking for the Api which she makes. According to one of her customers \"only she knows how to make it properly\". She boils the water in a big saucepan and goes on adding the ingredients until she gets the thick purple-coloured liquid which will be accompanied by fried empanadas and 'sopaipillas' (fried cheese bread). By around 10 o'clock there isn't enough enough left to fill a cup. \"Sometimes I have to make 2 pans, because in the winter it's what they want the most\" says the chef, with the confidence that comes from 11 years working in the market preparing this popular hot drink.

Su negocio lo realiza en la zona \u2018la portada\u2019 un sitio comercial populoso caracterizado por la variedad de productos agr\u00edcolas para trabajar y comerciar en el altiplano.\nTeodora es de tez morena, cabello largo trenzado, baja estatura, su forma de vestir es tradicional (sombrero, manta y pollera), su lengua materna es el aymara y habla espa\u00f1ol (sentada sombrero negro, manta blanca). Su vida la realiza con su esposo que se dedica al comercio de garrafas de gas y sus dos hijos que estudian en la escuela, viven en una casa propia de ladrillo y cuenta con agua potable y luz el\u00e9ctrica. La necesidad por alimentar a su familia la llev\u00f3 a formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de productos cosm\u00e9ticos, elaboraci\u00f3n de colchones,  venta de chamarras, venta de mandiles y lana, venta de chompas de alpaca, venta de chamarras para ni\u00f1os, taller de soldadura y tapizado de autos, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo e invertirlo en sus negocios. Su negocio es la confecci\u00f3n de polleras. Para confeccionar una pollera, se necesita entre tres o cuatro metros de tela, siempre y cuando el ancho de \u00e9sta sea de un metro y medio. Si el ancho de la tela es menor -por ejemplo, 1,20 metros- se necesitar\u00e1n al menos seis metros. Las telas no son baratas y la costura de la pollera es complicada.  Ella aprendi\u00f3 el oficio de su madre y toda la vida se dedic\u00f3 a este arte, llegando a confeccionar vistosas polleras para conjuntos folcl\u00f3ricos porque trabaja con mucho esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n.

Su sue\u00f1o es tener un taller de costura donde pueda confeccionar sus polleras con mayor comodidad y exhibirlas a sus clientes. Ella desea realizar la compra de tela por mayor, para confeccionar polleras y satisfacer las necesidades de sus clientes que compran por mayor a fin de a\u00f1o. Esta es la d\u00e9cima secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en nueve a\u00f1os que trabaja independientemente.\nEs por esos motivos que Teodora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de tela por mayor y confeccionar polleras para vender por mayor a sus clientes.\n","en":"Teodora is a 47 year old married woman with a 13 year old son and 9 year old daughter. Her business is making traditional skirts. She is enterprising, independent, responsible and hard-working. Her business is located in \"La portada\" zone, a busy commercial site known for its variety of agricultural products for working and selling in the mountains. <br \/><br \/>Teodora has a dark complexion, long curly hair; she's short and dresses traditionally (hat, shawl, skirt). Her first language is Aymara and her second is Spanish. She is seated wearing the black hat and white shawl). She works with her husband selling jugs of gasoline and her two children study in school. They live in their own brick house, with drinkable water and electricity. <br \/><br \/>The need to support her family caused her to form a community bank with others who have businesses: making bedspreads, selling clothing, selling wool and aprons, selling alpaca sweaters, selling children's sweaters, a welding shop and auto repairs. To make a skirt one needs between three to four meters of fabric, always, and when the layer is 1.5 meters. If the layer is narrower, for example 1.2 meters, then at least 6 meters of fabric is needed. The fabric is not cheap and the sewing is complicated. She learned this work from her mother and has sewn all her life. she makes beautiful skirts and traditional outfits because she works with care and dedication. Her workspace is a small place in her home, which has the advantage of sharing and being with her children. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to have a sewing shop where she can make skirts more easily and showcase them for her customers. She wants to buy the fabric at wholesale, to make the skirts and satisfy her customers who buy at the end of the year. this is the 10th loan sequence with the institution in the 9 years that she has been working independently. Therefore Teodora seeks a loan to buy fabric at wholesale and make skirts to sell at wholesale to her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":1745816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

This is how she decided ten years ago to sell minutes, and little by little she incorporated different businesses: a general store where she sells various products like stationery, feminine accessories, home goods, etc., fast food, cell phones and accessories, additional minutes, Internet service, ice cream, and candy.\r\n\r\nMarina is 59 years old with a 29 year-old son and two daughters, ages 37 and 29. She lives in a neighborhood located in the Soledad municipality, where she has many neighbors, friends, and passersby as clients and suppliers. Thanks to the range of items that she sells, she has a high demand for items, which are purchased in cash.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to save more money for the future.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Joseph\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 8 acres of land and purchase a total of 12 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1743483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase two solar lights and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Butere","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anythony A","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nipher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John A","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenniffer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":131430,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T21:47:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brian Arens"}},{"id":801503,"name":"Anita Limbani","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Anita Limbani tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil soltera, tiene un hijo a su  cargo, vive en casa propia, en el distrito de Oyotun, una zona rural donde su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda, ubicada en la Provincia de Cutervo que pertenece a la Regi\u00f3n Cajamarca, sierra norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nAnita Limbani se dedica a la crianza y venta de animales de corral(patos, conejos, cuyes, entre otros), desde hace 04 a\u00f1os, su negocio se encuentra ubicado en su domicilio, Anita Limbani solicita pr\u00e9stamo para capital de trabajo; pues ella necesita realizar la compra de pavos, gallinas, cerdos, cuyes, pichones por campa\u00f1a navide\u00f1a; el pr\u00e9stamo le ayudar\u00e1 para tener una mayor inversi\u00f3n de animales esto con la finalidad de incrementar su productividad de los mismos y satisfacer las diversas necesidades y preferencias de sus clientes.

She has been in this business for the past six years (she started in 2008 with the help of her mother).  Elora is divorced and lives with her mother in the Spitamen region.  Elora's mother has always been very supportive and she still supports her daughter with everything.  She was quite upset when her daughter's married life did not work out. But Elora is a strong woman; she didn't give up and instead gave herself entirely to her business.  Elora currently needs to borrow some money in order to buy seasonal merchandise and increase her sales' volume.  This loan will help Elora to expand her business, increase her income and sales, and at the same time will help with the family's budget.

Meet Margaret, a 36-year-old farmer from a remote village in Kesses in the Eldoret area of Kenya. She resides with her husband, with whom she is blessed with three children. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 10 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming, and sells milk, eggs and various food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she is facing is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry, and sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy, and green grams (mung beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production, and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. \r\n\r\nApart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure, and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that could have been spent in buying fertilizer. Your loan will bring joy to this family because she will be able to support her family and improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1745462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Uno de sus sue\u00f1os es conseguir m\u00e1s clientes a quienes compren por pedidos grandes para expandir su negocio y dar empleo a m\u00e1s personas aparte de su familia. \n\nCon toda su experiencia, Ren\u00e9 ha identificado que durante la temporada de lluvia sus ventas son bajas, pero ahora que diciembre se acerca, necesita comprar m\u00e1s tela porque tiene fe en que sus ganancias aumenten y se pueda recuperar un poco. \n\nRen\u00e9, Adela y Carolina conforman el grupo, viven en una comunidad donde la mayor\u00eda de los habitantes son artesanos, se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de gorros, guantes, bufandas, calentadores como Carolina que quiere invertir en su actividad para aprovechar la \u00e9poca de invierno.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la comunidad donde viven los integrantes*\n","en":"\"Since I was a child, my father showed me how to make a living working as a salesman\", says Ren\u00e9, who remembers how his father took him with him to sell car accessories in other cities. Ren\u00e9 is now 25 years old, is married to Adela and has a baby and a 4-year old child who is not in school yet. Ren\u00e9 and Adela need a loan to buy fabric and keep making covers for car seats. \r\n\r\nRen\u00e9 used to love visiting other places and also sharing more time with his father. As he was growing up, he also started to help him with the sales, but they realized their suppliers had good income from the seat covers and decided to make them themselves. They became independent 5 years ago. They only had a sewing machine in their studio at the beginning, but now have 5 as well as 3 family members who help with production. They all get together daily at 9am to start working and do not leave until 10pm. Ren\u00e9 sells the product in Guadalajara and Sinaloa (located approximately 4 hours away from his community). His job is so well known that he has clients from other places that simply bring the fabric for him to make the covers. \"These are the most stressful cases as they need the product quickly\", says Ren\u00e9. One of his dreams is to have more clients that buy in bulk so that they can expand the business and employ more people outside of his family. \r\n\r\nThanks to his experience, Ren\u00e9 has realized that his sales are lower during the rainy season, but now that December is approaching, he needs to buy more fabric. He expects that revenues will go up and that he will compensate. \r\n\r\nRen\u00e9, Adela and Carolina are the team members. They live in a community where most people are artisans and make hats, gloves, scarfs, leg-warmers, etc., like Carolina, who wants to invest in her business and make the most of the winter season. \r\n\r\n*The picture was taken in the community where the members live*\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":1738552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-PHPs-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house.\r\n\r\nHe also has a carinderia (small restaurant) business for additional income. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his businesses, he is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory, and to purchase raw ingredients needed in his carinderia business.\r\n\r\nJoventino dreams to grow his business and hopes to give his children a good life and education. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week, and this is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

est\u00e1 rodeada por cerros y 2 de las integrantes se dedican a vender este tipo de pescado. \n\nLos integrantes del grupo y sus actividades son:\n\nMargarita - Venta De Ropa\nOfelia - Servicio De

hijos todos ellos mayores de edad. Desde hace ya 30 a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de pan junto con su esposo. En un inicio, bastaba con hacer todo el proceso manualmente ya que la producci\u00f3n era conservadora. Con el paso del tiempo y al tener m\u00e1s clientes, la situaci\u00f3n ha cambiado, Agustina ahora tiene un horno de piedra m\u00e1s grande y una batidora para poder mezclar una mayor cantidad de masa. Estas herramientas de trabajo las ha comprado gracias a los ahorros de sus ganancias y con los pr\u00e9stamos de VisionFund.\n\nDo\u00f1a Agustina y su esposo son fuente de empleo para otras personas en su comunidad, en la elaboraci\u00f3n del pan los apoyan dos personas y para repartir el producto, siete m\u00e1s. Do\u00f1a Agustina comenta que en temporada de fr\u00edo la producci\u00f3n del pan aumenta y venden a la semana alrededor de 3000 piezas. Ya que esta temporada est\u00e1 cerca, Agustina necesita comprar m\u00e1s harina, az\u00facar, manteca, queso, colorante, papel estraza, canastos, charolas y pinzas para continuar con la actividad.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda se tom\u00f3 bajo la cocina de do\u00f1a Refugio quien viste blusa blanca falda negra.

It is surrounded by hills (cerros) and two of the members sell sea bream (mojarra).\r\n\r\nThe members and their sales and services businesses are the following:\r\n\r\nMargarita - Clothing \r\nOfelia - Metalwork \r\nAgustin - Pigs\r\nAgustina \u2013 Bread \r\nJuana - Taco and cake \r\nLaura - Sea bream \r\nMaria Magdalen - Shoes by catalogue\r\nMaria Del Refugio - Seabream\r\nNarciza - Groceries\r\nAlejandrina -  Fruit salad\r\n\r\nAgustina is a very cheerful, hard-working, responsible, kind woman.  She is the mother of four adult children.  For 30 years she has been baking and selling bread together with her husband.  At first she did all the process by hand because production was low.  But over time and with the increase of customers the situation has changed.  Agustina now has a larger stone oven and a blender to mix more dough.  She was able to buy these work tools thanks to savings she earned and loans from VisionFund.\r\n\r\nAgustina and her husband are a source of employment for other people in their community.  Two other people help them make the bread and seven more help deliver.  Agustina says that in the cold season bread production increases and the weekly sales volume reaches 3,000 loaves.  The season is near and Agustina must buy flour, sugar, lard, cheese, coloring, brown paper, baskets, trays and tongs to continue her activity.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken under Refugio's kitchen.

Although he is pictured alone, he is actually representing his group of 15 farmers in Teso District, Kenya. Walter has always been described as a very hardworking individual, which is largely why he was selected to be the group leader.\r\n\r\nWalter started working with One Acre Fund for the first time in 2012, and this year he decided to not only get farming inputs but also a solar light as part of his loan. He is very excited about this new addition, as now he will be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. He can\u2019t wait to save more money for the future using the profits he earns from this coming season. \r\n\r\nWalter's Group will be able to plant a total of 11.25 acres using the farming inputs obtained with this loan, and will also receive a total of seven solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1742574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light, as well as hybrid seeds and fertilizer to improve harvests of maize.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Teso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:03Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kefa  O","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin O","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenta A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peres C","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zipporah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kevine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick Herman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua O","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":156680,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156680}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":806808,"name":"Ahed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahed, who appears in the photo, is a 19-year-old single man from Jabalia city.

As the president of the group called MUNGU BARIKI, he thinks highly of farming since it makes him independent in his quest for livelihood: food, school fees, and medical expenses for the members of his family. \r\n\r\nHowever, this activity runs afoul of the difficulty with manual labor; laborers are very expensive, paths [between the fields] have to be kept up, and [there is] warehousing at harvest time. \r\n\r\nThis loan will allow him to cover weeding and buying insecticides and fertilizer, as well as plowing another field. In future he would like to expand his agricultural activities to include market gardening (peanuts, maize, etc.), be certain of paying school fees for his seven children, and carry out his plan to install a mill to grind manioc so as to diversify his income sources. \r\n\r\nFrom left to right, Eliakimu is the fourth, wearing a black shirt and holding some plants.

is 40 years old,  married, and the father of five children.  In his youth, he was already working the land, helping his father build their house and taking care of the livestock.  After his marriage, Mirzo continued to breed cattle because his parents had no money to send him to university.  Today, Mirzo owns 15 hectares of land and he is involved in animal husbandry.  Additionally he grows fruits and vegetables.  After the harvest, Mirzo and his son sell their crops at the market, where they are in high demand. \r\n\r\nMirzo is now planning to buy feed for his cattle, but he doesn't have enough money.  For this reason, he has turned to MDO Arvand for financial support.  He hopes that MDO Arvand will grant him this request and lend him the sum that he needs to expand his business.  He thanks you in advance for your trust and cooperation.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":311.91,"image":{"id":1743215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed for his livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Mastchoh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.13,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":744},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":766.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":789.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.94,"local_amount":294.2,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":309.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.82,"payment_id":731040264},{"amount":210.84,"local_amount":1216.12,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1277.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":40.31,"payment_id":755519930}],"funded_date":"2015-01-16T06:28:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":806809,"name":"Melda's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melda, pictured above, has been a farmer for 12 years, and is now proud to represent her group of 16 farmers in Teso District.

The housing will have a plentiful, dependable supply of good water, made available 24 hours a day. The income she will make from this investment will put her in a position to comfortably afford increasing farming costs.

her own business. Thanks to the introduction of Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders in her life, she can achieve this dream and continue upward. Rael is a very ambitious and enterprising go-getter who hails from the Eldoret area of Kenya. She is the proud mother of six and has been doing mixed farming for the past 10 years. Her primary sources of income are from selling eggs, milk and crops and from some personal business she does to make ends meet. Rael loves farming and has even nicknamed her cow. She really takes good care of her dairy cows. The Eldoret area has favorable conditions for horticultural farming, which is good soil, climate and a transport system as well as an existing market for horticulture products. Rael wants to take advantage of these conditions and start horticultural farming. She is seeking a loan to start this new enterprise. Through an increased income, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. The financial benefits that Rael will reap will be almost immediate; hence she will be assured a secure future. She plans to start exporting her horticulture products to international markets once she has accumulated more profits.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1745568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.42,"local_amount":3415.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3458.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194793},{"amount":31.37,"local_amount":2788.26,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2823.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824335},{"amount":32.41,"local_amount":2880.61,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2916.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262620},{"amount":34.84,"local_amount":3096.49,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3135.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264698},{"amount":36.77,"local_amount":3268.29,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3309.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600936},{"amount":35.58,"local_amount":3162.92,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3202.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459359},{"amount":37.68,"local_amount":3437.44,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3480.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.99,"payment_id":681377793},{"amount":38.21,"local_amount":3510.37,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3554.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.28,"payment_id":696587449},{"amount":36.93,"local_amount":3493.59,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3537.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.37,"payment_id":711505777},{"amount":118.11,"local_amount":10946.53,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":11083.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.04,"payment_id":731022574}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T13:21:37Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":806854,"name":"Robert's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is 33 years old and is often described as a very reliable person.

Being born second in a family of eight, Hellen learned at a tender age the value of sacrificing one's needs for the betterment of others. \r\n\r\nEight years ago, she started farming on her father's two-acre piece of land to support her siblings and children. Today, she has two dairy cows, eight poultry birds, a pig, and 20 trees on the farm. She finds it easy to introduce any farming technique that adds value to the farm business and improves productivity. \r\n\r\nSome years back, Hellen introduced irrigation which has helped her crops grow green and healthy. Now, she is seeking a loan from the Kiva lenders to introduce cattle housing. \r\n\r\nA half-decade ago, Juhudi Kilimo partnered with Kiva to finance agricultural assets on various rural farms in Kenya. Over the years, we have learned from our dairy farmers that having a cowshed has quite a positive impact on milk production and the health of the cows. \r\n\r\nHellen will use the income from this investment to continue to provide for her family and pay for her children's education.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Violet\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 8 acres of land and purchase a total of 15 solar lights."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1744468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Teso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siforoso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Innocent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dan Antony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Douglas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haron Omusiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sallo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Naswa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":166080,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166080}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":806953,"name":"Tasleem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tasleem is a married woman and 34 years of age.

The profit from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Emily is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. She will also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets. Emily believes that if female farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of the world's hungry could be reduced by half."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":586.4,"image":{"id":1745722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She doesn\u2019t stand out in a crowd. She\u2019s not the first one to speak, nor the loudest. She sits down every day in the evening to catch the latest intrigue on her favorite local radio station, which provides maybe the only break in her day. Peres is married and blessed with four lovely children who she refers to as \u201cmy heartbeat.\u201d Her primary sources of income are milk selling, poultry farming, and some personal business that she does to supplement her meager income. Deciding to practice poultry farming for Peres was not difficult. \u201cI was brought up with chickens raised by my grandfather and grandmother,\u201d Peres said. \u201cIt is in my blood.\u201d For the past ten years, Peres has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and she wants to increase her poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. She is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high. With your loan, Peres is going to make more income that will enable her to take care of her family's expenses. As the times keep getting harder, Peres is doing all she can do to ensure that her family's basic needs are met. Peres believes that ending poverty begins with empowering women so that they can control their own destiny."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":573.43,"image":{"id":1745727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

The community of Ongeng  collects their drinking water from Kamenya Kwandiku pond because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Ongeng\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Ongeng, 20 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Carolyne has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 4 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community namely Saline, Hellen, Jocinter, and Evans who are also part of this group loan.\n\nOngeng community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Carolyne believes that the dispenser will help them treat water leading to a reduction of water-borne diseases. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Carolyne\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1748697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T19:30:06Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jocinter ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":74,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-15T01:34:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":802159,"name":"Maria Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria de 51 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su grupo familiar, ella posee una peque\u00f1a tienda ubicada en su lugar de residencia desde hace varios a\u00f1os, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos del hogar, ella esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de m\u00e1s sopas, huevos, granos b\u00e1sicos, refrescos, golosinas, pan dulce, etc. y as\u00ed poder tener mejores ingresos para una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Maria, 51, lives in her own house with her family.

She is a young farmer practicing mixed farming. For the past 10 years, her primary source of income has been milk, maize, and a variety of crops she plants. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to Mary's heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she earns profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit. Therefore, Mary requested a loan, which she will use to build a modern dairy unit. A dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of exposure to harsh weather conditions. Mary believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

He is a loving husband, father and grandfather to beautiful grandchildren. He is married. Abdugappor has been earning a living his whole life by providing house repair services to people. He inherited this trade from his father and grandfather. He raised his children, married them off and now thinks that he needs to make his contribution to raising his grandchildren. The grown children help their parents. Abdugappor's work is mainly seasonal, and he does house repairs either in the spring or summer time, and has a break during the winter because people primarily do repairs during warm times of year. With the onset of cold weather, his work orders decreased and he now has an opportunity to repair his own house. To be prepared for the winter cold, he wants to repair his house roof, so that it would not leak during the winter, and his family would be warm. He needs money to buy the necessary materials for repairs that will solve his problem. Because this is not his first time obtaining a loan from \"Arvand\", he came to Arvand for help and advice. He hopes that obtaining this loan from us will allow him to complete repairs in-time, despite the fact that cold weather has arrived."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1743486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

","en":"Gupron is 48 years old. He is married and has three children. He has a secondary education. He and his wife raise the children and try to provide them with education, so that they could find decent and well-paid jobs in the future. This is not Gupron's first time obtaining a loan from \"Arvand\" and he has a good credit history. Gupron is happy with the service at \"Arvand\" and finds it convenient to obtain a loan right there.

Su elaboraci\u00f3n a grandes rasgos es sencilla; consiste en picar primero la carne, la cual una vez mezclada con las especias, que deben estar bien picadas,  se amasa y va incorporando un an\u00eds seco y que le da su sabor especial; se termina el proceso embutiendo la carne en las mismas tripas del cerdo y atando las ristras con un hilo de algod\u00f3n. \u201cla receta viene de mi familia, es un negocio de larga trayectoria y ahora quiero ampliarlo\u2026\u201d comenta. Su sue\u00f1o es producir a gran escala y proveer a mercados y supermercados sus productos.

She has a business making and selling artisan chorizo. She is enterprising, active, responsible, patient, hardworking, and a good mother. Her business is in the southern part of the city, which is an area characterized by growing commerce in all areas, as well as a warm, tropical and humid climate with a constant temperature of between 21-30 degrees Celsius all year.\r\n\r\nAna has tanned skin and is of medium height with long black hair. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her older relatives. For her business, she uses Spanish. In the photo, she is first on the right with green pants and a blue shirt. She lives with her four children. The three older children are studying at school and the youngest is still under her care. They live in their own house with running water and electricity. Due to her desire to succeed, she started a communal bank of people to apply for a loan and grow their business, which include making fabric, selling fish, construction services, selling empanadas, selling cosmetics, selling seasonal clothing and sewing with a machine. \r\n\r\nHer business is making and selling artisan chorizo. Using traditional methods to make chorizo gives it the special flavor which comes from making meat products at home. The quality of the product is determined by the quality of the meat used in making it. The process is generally simple and consists of chopping the meat, mixing it with spices which should be well chopped, kneading it, and adding dry anise which gives it its special flavor. The process ends by packing the meat into pig intestines and tying the strings with cotton thread. She says, \"The recipe comes from my family, it is a business with a long trajectory and now I want to expand it...\" Her dream is to produce her products on a large scale and to supply them to markets and supermarkets. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to expand her business by buying tables, chairs, and a chef's cart to sell her products. This is her first sequence of loans with the institution in the eight years she has had her business activity. This is why Ana is applying for a loan to buy tables, chairs, and a chef's cart to sell her artisan chorizo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1738689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs, and a chef's cart to sell her chorizo.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cupertino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vda De Justini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilbert ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1853.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1831.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1858.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1884.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1911.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1938.52},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1966.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1994.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2022.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2051.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2080.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2107.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":274.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1082.57,"local_amount":7427.87,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7480.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157394},{"amount":561.09,"local_amount":3849.83,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3876.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554301},{"amount":577.18,"local_amount":3960.2,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3988.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226840},{"amount":593.72,"local_amount":4073.73,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4102.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214018},{"amount":610.44,"local_amount":4188.37,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4217.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564148}],"funded_date":"2014-12-03T22:04:08Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:28:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Volz","image":1623268}},{"id":807195,"name":"Gjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gjon a 56-year-old villager from northern Albania who wants to repair a damaged stable for his animals, and he needs your help for this.\r\n\r\nGjon is married, and has three children; the middle daughter goes to university for geography\/history and the youngest one, a 17-year-old, is in high school.
