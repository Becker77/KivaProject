Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In August 2014, eight active women from Namigaon village located in the Titilagarh block of Balangir district, one of the poorest districts of India, stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their family by their contribution. They formed a group named Mahalaxmi to avail credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing businesses Mithila is one of the members who is standing with her hand raised in the photo. She is 32 years old and living with her husband, one son who is eight years old and one daughter who is six years old. Mithila hails from a traditional cloth weaving community. Being a member of a weaver family, she has been involved in this work from her childhood. Since her marriage, she has been running a cloth weaving unit with her husband. Presently, she has one handoom for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader in a village of 20 kms away.  80 to 100 pieces are prepared from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Mithila does the initial processing of the thread to make it ready for weaving and after that, her husband fits it to the handloom and weaves the sari. They only weave saris because of the demand for them in the market. Her family works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves one piece of sari on each handloom. Mithila sells her product to the local traders on a weekly basis. She earns a monthly income of Rs 6,000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. So with the present loan, she wants to buy another handloom weaving machine and thread\/yarn in bulk. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs of her raw material. Mithila wishes to grow her business and save enough to start a cloth store in her village. The other members of this group are also doing small enterprises for which they will take a loan and expand their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1745898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing another handloom weaving machine and thread\/yarn in bulk for more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"NAMIGAON, TITILAGARH, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-12-02T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-16T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hemalata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jashobanti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kula Bati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mithila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prajnasini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sairendri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sushila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":96000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":96000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-08T20:24:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":802177,"name":"Maria Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria de 55 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposo y su nieta, se dedica a la venta de tortillas,  ella quiere mejorar su vivienda colocando piso, techo y construir una pared en el lugar que muestra la fotograf\u00eda, pero no tiene de suficiente capital, por esa raz\u00f3n solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de piso cer\u00e1mico, cemento, laminas, polines, ladrillos, hierro y pago de mano de obra para que el y su familia puedan vivir seguros y c\u00f3modos.","en":"Maria, who is 55 years old, lives in her own house with her husband and their granddaughter.

She is a lovely mother of five single children.  For the last 20 years, she has been involved in agri-business. By owning a farmland, she grows rice and sells the crops to the local dealers, and sometimes she sells directly to customers at the market. She is able to generate a decent earning to support her family.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her agri-business seems to be down this season. The crops that she has harvested are insufficient either for sale or household use.

She is a native of the small city of Tursunzoda, which is named in honor of the famous writer and national hero of the Republic of Tajikistan, Mirzo Tursunzoda.  Mohiston is married and she has three children.  Her husband is currently working abroad, so Mohiston raises her children alone.  Mohiston stays home, takes care of the household, but she also finds the time to take orders and sew women's clothes.

He is 37 years old, and is requesting this new loan to make a new investment in the cultivation of carrots.  He's taken loans with other institutions, but they have not given him the same benefits that he is getting with ADICLA, such as the form of the payments, low monthly interest rates, and payment of principal at maturity.  These are benefits that help us to dream of having a better future for our children.  \r\n\r\nGilberto will use this second loan to buy carrot seeds and organic and chemical fertilizers so that he can start cultivating more products to later sell in the market in his community.  This way, he can obtain more earnings to support his family and give them suitable living conditions.  \r\n\r\nThe difference that a loan makes is mainly that one can guarantee his harvest with the supplies and with the general management of his crops.  This way, farmers can obtain better quality products.  This is what happened to Gilberto through the loans that he was granted before; he was able to obtain better harvests.\r\n\r\nOne of Gilberto's goals is to build a house for his son so that he can have suitable living conditions, and he also wants to provide his son with an education so that he can become a professional in life.

is age 29.  She is a mother of three children and lives in Lahore, Pakistan.  Her husband has been running a general store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits, etc.  He manages his household necessities from his own store, and his relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with an even tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town, and that is the reason his business runs well. Due to good relations his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Tahira requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stock of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc. Tahira hopes that her husband will utilize the loan in a positive way.  This amount will help him to cope with the demands of the family. Tahira thanks Kiva and field partner BRAC

He has been feeding the whole family, through the generated income from this vegetable shop. <br \/><br \/>Nowadays, the needs of his family suddenly increased, and he does not have other sources of income to cope with these needs. So he decided to expand his current business. He wants to increase his stock on a daily basis, so that he can maximize sales of the vegetables.

He earns a minimum of 600 PHP net income a day.\r\n\r\nTo help him maintain his business, he is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP, to buy additional raw ingredients such as pork, fish, chicken and seasonings that are needed for his cooking.  He is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on his investment, and the financial help that will be given him, for it will surely help cover their daily living expense, and for the school needs of his child.\r\n\r\nViolito dreams to grow his business, to improve the quality of their lives, and secure the education of their child.

When asked, Mohammed spoke of his ambition to use the additional income to educate his children, eventually hoping to ensure other members of his community are lifted out of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1627560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for child school fees and uniforms; eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-03T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-17T15:40:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohammed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":15498,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":15498}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-04T07:47:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":802176,"name":"D\u00fao Santa Fe Oca\u00f1a Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao Santa fe Oca\u00f1a El encargado de este grupo es el se\u00f1or Emilio quien se dedica a la siembra y venta de flores, como gladiolas, claveles, rosas de primera, segunda y algunas hiervas.

Ruth is dark-skinned, short-statured and has long black hair. Her native language is Quechua, which is spoken a lot in the region. She also speaks Spanish. She lives with her two daughters who go two school in a house owned by her grandmother. The house is made of bricks and has potable water and electricity. \r\n\r\nHer job is tailoring of women's clothing, such as braziers, pajamas, panties, uniforms, wedding dresses and more. She began her business because her siblings make a living as tailors and they taught her everything they know about the business. Currently, she sells her clothing wholesale and she needs an overlock sewing machine to sew rounded edges.  \"I started out because my siblings taught me the trade, later I bought an industrial sewing machine and now I need an over...\", she says. \r\n\r\nRuth's dream is to have her own house.

The Nandihills area is very populated, so demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable.  She stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, so she is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and extend her poultry market to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1746582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Esther is a mother of two who has overcome this challenge and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary source of income has been selling eggs, maize and milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. \r\n\r\nEsther, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is for the older generation. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early-riser and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. \r\n\r\nEsther is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand.

She lives in the village of Thiba in the Kerugoya area of Kenya, where she is a farmer. For the past five years, Salome has been actively involved in mixed farming, and because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and fuel wood, in addition to household chores, childcare, and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a setback for Salome who has been earning great profits in farming.\r\n\r\nKerugoya is one of the places that has favorable conditions for horticulture farming - good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Salome has always wanted to diversify and start horticulture farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds to start the business off the ground. She requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to start horticulture farming. She joined Juhudi Kilimo because it supports young and enterprising farmers. With the loan, she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers, and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market hence making more money. This loan will improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1746609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

Meet Irene, a 36-year-old mother who is so humble, honest, and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Irene is a mother of two lovely children that she really adores so much, and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs.\r\n \r\nIrene hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya. Irene never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Irene started farming and has been doing farming for the past three years. Through those years she has gathered so much experience, and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. \r\n\r\nIrene practices mixed farming on her farm, and through the profits she has managed to take care of her family's needs and also give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. \r\n\r\nIrene is a woman who is very enterprising, and she is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Irene wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Irene make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Irene hopes that through the loan she will improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nIrene's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. \r\n\r\nIrene is not a selfish woman, and will also want to impact positively on society; that is why she will employ people to work for her on her horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":333.49,"image":{"id":1746626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-03T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-17T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.77,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.05,"local_amount":6671.43,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6762.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264712},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":3123.37,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3165.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459371},{"amount":67.17,"local_amount":6121.12,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6204.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.69,"payment_id":681377805},{"amount":68.81,"local_amount":6502.96,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6591.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.35,"payment_id":711505787},{"amount":78.55,"local_amount":7224.89,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7323.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.73,"payment_id":752110818}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T01:07:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":807747,"name":"Ngumbi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngumbi is 76 years old, married, and together with his spouse they have been blessed with 10 children.

All members of this group belong to the Schedule Caste, which is supposed to be the most underdeveloped community in India. The people of this community are socially, educationally, and economically deprived. <br \/><br \/>Nuapada district is a most backward district with more rural habitation. This group was started in October 2014 with a purpose to raise the income level of their families. <br \/><br \/>Jajoti is one of the members, and is standing with her hand raised in the photo. She is 26 years old, living with her husband and one son, aged three years. Jajoti is maintaining her family by running a bike-repair garage with the help of her husband at the road point of Khariar town, which is 10 km from her village. <br \/><br \/>In 2011, her husband started this workshop. She has employed one youth in the garage and is paying him 2,000 INR per month. She earns a monthly income of 7,000 INR from her garage. But, this amount is not at all sufficient to manage the family expenses, garage expenses, and to plan for the future development.

Meet Esther, a farmer who practices agriculture with a difference, combining youthful energy and enthusiasm with knowledge attained through agricultural training and business studies to develop her agriculture business.\r\n\r\nEsther has been practicing farming for the last five years on her small plot, where she does mixed farming. She enjoys farming so much, and every day she wakes up to go to the farm and improve her life. Through farming, she has been able to take care of her large family and provide them with their basic needs.\r\n\r\nHaving the traits of a go-getter, Esther has always dreamed big.

Damaris is a hard-working small-holder farmer in Nyamira, which is a small rural town in the banana-growing region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nFor the last 15 years of her life, Damaris has been doing mixed farming. This has worked out well for her since she has been able to provide a decent living for her four children. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops. \r\n\r\nDamaris is seeking a loan to construct a dairy shed. This will provide shelter for her favorite animal, named Maritati. The thing she enjoys most about dairy farming is selling milk. However, in order for a dairy cow to be more productive, the farmer needs to be good at dairy management. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help Damaris construct a cowshed that will help very much with dairy management.

is an entrepreneur operating on a 140-acre piece of land in the Nkubu region of Kenya. She had been married for 30 years when her husband passed on, leaving behind four children for her to look after. \r\n\r\nHe also left behind a significant piece of land that Ruth is making use of to practise mixed-farming. She keeps three dairy cows, 20 head of poultry, and over 600 trees. \r\n\r\nAt this point of her life, she is forced to work tirelessly to meet the family's growing needs. For example, her highest annual expense on her children's education alone is over USD $3,400 (one in high school and two on campus).  To keep providing adequately for her family, she decided to think outside the box and come up with a good business plan with favorable return on investment. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan of KES 300,000 to start an agrovet business. Her vision is for the business to be a leading enterprise in its category in the Nkubu area, offering farm inputs and animal feeds at affordable prices. She is anticipating many customers, as there is little competition in the area.\r\n\r\nShe has already invested some of her own savings to get the business started. She plans to use your loan investment to purchase more items to stock the agrovet. Through the income she projects from the agrovet, she will be able to pay school fees and meet other needs of his family without much straining. \r\n\r\nRuth is a great client to Juhudi Kilimo; she has a perfect credit risk score. She has successfully serviced her previous loan (the same amount as she is seeking today). \r\n\r\nA single lending from you to Ruth is a big demonstration of your vote of confidence in the future of a great woman with a strong mental fortitude of putting her family first and overcoming all other obstacles in her way to better life.
