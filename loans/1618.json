Yusuf Madakin-Daji, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to expand his farmland, and hopes to become the most profitable farmer in his community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1635054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-03T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-17T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusuf Madakin-Daji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":18123,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":18123}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-10T22:50:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":807719,"name":"Ruziboy","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0439  \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435 58 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0423 \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u044f \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0443\u0442  \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \n\u0423 \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u044f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0443\u0445\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u043c. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u044e. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0434\u044f\u043c  \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041e\u0442 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0420\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0410\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442.\n\n","en":"Ruziboy is a very hardworking 59-year-old man.

The town is known for its historical and cultural importance. In this picturesque municipality, ten women come together as part of the Flor de Azucena Atitl\u00e1n, or Atitl\u00e1n Flower Trust Bank. The group is made up of passionate, exuberant businesswomen who take pride in their Kakchiquel Mayan traditions while making use of modern conveniences to run their businesses and improve their lives.\r\n\r\nAndrea is one of the members of the Trust Bank. Andrea and her husband, a mechanic in Santiago, have six children. As a child, this hardworking individual attended school for six years, but was forced to abandon her studies due to a lack of resources. Andrea now owns a hardware store, which she has operated for five years. Thanks in part to the income of her business, all of six her children have attended school up to university level and one is currently a teacher. As she currently doesn\u00b4t have any employees, she operates the store by herself. However, with the new loan she plans to hire an employee to help her with merchandise and customer service. So, Andrea is applying for a loan. She also plans to diversify the tools and products she carries in her store. \r\n\r\nDuring their monthly meetings, the women receive informal education on diverse topics such as health and wellness, business management and strategies to improve their sales in order to improve their self-esteem and run their businesses effectively. This month, before receiving their new disbursement of Kiva loans, the women discuss the details of the loan. They all agree to pay on time and to support each other in their business ventures. \r\n\r\nThe members of the Atitl\u00e1n Flower Trust Bank are thankful for the generosity of Kiva investors. With the help of people worldwide, the women are able to work towards a brighter future for themselves, their families and the community of Santiago

is Marichu, 33, resident of Batasan Hills, Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Resty, a bus conductor, and they have one child who is at elementary level. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to augment their income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs and to send her child to school. \r\n\r\nMarichu has operated a general store for four years already. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells pre-paid loads to mobile subscribers of different telecommunication companies for added income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items such as sacks of rice, peanut butter, canned goods, soda and other grocery stuff. She is positive that it will boost her income as she expands her business. Her earnings are their source to meet their daily expenses and to send her child to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\r\n\r\nMarichu hopes to maintain and grow her business so she they could have a better life. She strives hard to give her child the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1747067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery items such as rice, peanut butter, and hot dogs to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-03T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-17T22:50:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marichu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134466},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5390.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757236},{"amount":90,"local_amount":3999.99,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200374},{"amount":90,"local_amount":4000.04,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186657}],"funded_date":"2014-12-03T23:42:40Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":808071,"name":"Meaalofa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meaalofa is a 48-year-old, married woman with five children.

He operates a motorcycle and bicycle repair shop located in a very busy area on the southwest of the city of Barranquilla.  His main clients are people from the neighborhood, car drivers or motorcycle owners who work in the transportation business and employees who use these type of vehicles. He works 11 hours a day from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.  \r\nHe buys the motorcycle and bicycle replacement parts cash at specialized wholesale warehouses. His business has good cash flow given that the clients pay cash at the time of service. He wants to improve his business so he's requesting his first loan from Kiva through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy a cylinder boring machine with which to increase the quality of his services. \r\nJes\u00fas has a 5 year old son and two daughters of 3 and 10 years of age whom he wants to give the opportunity to study and strive for a better future. His goal for the business is to increase his work capacity and he prepares everyday for that purpose so that he can obtain the success that he envisions.

His family has always worked in this business and so following this tradition led him to learn these skills. He sells the handicrafts from his outlet which is situated in the middle of the city of Barranquilla, a place which is very busy due to commerce. His main customers are visitors and passers-by in the area, as well as buyers who visit him there. He works from 8am to 6pm.\r\n\r\nMiguel does his sales on a cash basis and also uses cash to make his purchases in the stores which are located in the same area. For this reason the amount he produces and has for sale is lower than the sales he would like. Currently he is applying for a Kiva loan. This is the first loan he is applying to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and he will use it to buy stones and carved beads for bracelets, so he can offer new designs in his range and make his business more attractive.\r\n\r\nMiguel is 56 years old and has 2 daughters aged 30 and 28.

Foundation, to purchase primary materials like flour and inputs such as sugar, lard, milk products, etc. With these, he will increase production of cheese and butter breads, lines of production that move easily, generating larger and immediate profits due to their high consumption. \r\n\r\nAdalberto's goal further along is to have a shop, a commercial point where he could offer more products that

My father is Sri, and my mother is Boiman. I am the 3rd of 5 children. My father works as a laborer, and my mother as a housewife. I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters. My first brother is married. One of my sisters recently graduated vocational school, and is still looking for a job in town. My other siblings are still in school. They go to school by bicycle, while I am sometimes driven to school by my father. Other times I hitchhike with my classmates.\r\n\r\nAlthough my father's occupation is laborer, he does not always have work. Sometimes he does whatever is legal in order to provide for the family. My father works when he can, while my mother looks after the household. Sometimes my father gets 50,000 per day from his work, but the money is divided up for our daily needs. My pocket money every day is just 3.000, and even then I often do not have breakfast because I can't afford to buy it. I sincerely hope that this Kiva loan will help ease the burden on my family. \r\n\r\nI am determined to help my parents after graduation, and I want to make them happy. That is a glimpse of my family's economy. Thanks for your attention and thank you for Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1747720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

Mairamkan is a leader of the \"Jashtyk\" group that, besides her, consists of 2 more people. In order to further develop her business, Mairamkan requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy seeds, fertilizers and plastic for farming needs and to be able to grow ecologically clean vegetables and fruits.

Meet Jane. This borrower is blessed with good looks, sensitivity, and a great deal of courage. She lives in the Nyamira area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills carpeted in manicured tea plantations and banana farming. \r\n\r\nJane is a mother of 10 children and she has been in the agriculture business for 20 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and tea. Jane has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, the rising costs of farming inputs, such as for fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Jane remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nJane is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Jane will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her is timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better quality products and more yields. This loan will support Jane\u2019s economic activity and will change her family\u2019s living standards indirectly."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":291.02,"image":{"id":1747809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-04T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-18T17:50:05Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":4837.15,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5090.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824375},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":4671.1,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4915.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264716},{"amount":56.34,"local_amount":4828.88,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5081.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459376},{"amount":58.18,"local_amount":5142.23,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5411.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.81,"payment_id":696587465},{"amount":61.28,"local_amount":5465.02,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5751.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.48,"payment_id":731022587}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T00:22:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":808461,"name":"Marcosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcosa is a single woman.

Kenya.  Stella owns a 2-acre farm. On the farm, she practices mixed farming. This mother of five keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. She has 10 years of experience in farming. \r\n\r\nStella is seeking a loan to expand her farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output.  Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Stella. \r\n\r\nThrough a group of 10 members called Mwendatu, Stella has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household.

Today, she sells milk, tea, eggs, maize, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of her immense knowledge of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow. Although she earns a profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit. She requested a loan, which she will use to build a modern dairy unit. With the loan, she will have an easier time milking and feeding her cow. A good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax. It can also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions. Pamela believes that with this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition, because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain under-served by financial institutions. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers.<br \/><br \/>Meet Nelly, an ever-smiling young farmer from Kapsowar County, in Kenya. She has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is a proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business, in order to make ends meet. Nelly passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow.<br \/><br \/>Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best-quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Nelly is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow, which will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With the loan, she will buy a dairy cow that can produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand.<br \/><br \/>Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, Nelly attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her to save more money, to repay the loan fully, and to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1747898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-04T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-18T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4973.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6262.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6445.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.27,"local_amount":9626.15,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":9855.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262633},{"amount":58.87,"local_amount":5185.99,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5309.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264720},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":5129.22,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5251.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600952},{"amount":63.36,"local_amount":5581.62,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5714.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459380},{"amount":473.89,"local_amount":42752.02,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":43772.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.39,"payment_id":681377810}],"funded_date":"2014-12-29T16:42:58Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":808536,"name":"Pricilla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pricilla is a widowed mother of three children; one of them attends school and the others do not because they are adults.

Serkizhan has a secondary education and has an extensive work experience. She previously worked as a salesperson, sorter and daycare teacher. Now she is retired and involved in animal husbandry and farming, growing beans on 2.33 hectares of owned land. Her farm also contains 1 cow, 1 bull and 15 sheep. She sells ecologically-clean milk and wheat to local residents. Her products are in high demand. Serkizhan's monthly business profit is about 5,000 som (KGS), which is not sufficient for a decent life, despite her additional pension income. This is why Serkizhan decided to request a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a dairy cow. Serkizhan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her business, which will help her improve her family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1746661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a dairy cow in order to increase her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ozgorush village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-12-04T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-18T21:00:05Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Serkizhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3088},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3144},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3235},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3400},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3427},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3543},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3628},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3744},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3841},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.14},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.79},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.14,"local_amount":3088,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3175.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595436666},{"amount":56.14,"local_amount":3144,"processed_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3232.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751658},{"amount":57.77,"local_amount":3235,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3326.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799376},{"amount":60.26,"local_amount":3400,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3495.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":636161521},{"amount":61.2,"local_amount":3427,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3523.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513916},{"amount":63.27,"local_amount":3543,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3642.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995686},{"amount":64.79,"local_amount":3628,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3730.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291076},{"amount":66.86,"local_amount":3744,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3849.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500311},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":7791,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8010.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.87,"payment_id":711411260}],"funded_date":"2014-12-06T01:38:42Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T13:03:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":808562,"name":"Purity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Purity is a married woman with one child, who attends school.

She first began by doing her daughters' hair and in that way learned to improve her abilities.  \r\n\r\nHer neighbors and others recognized the quality of her work and began to become her principle customers, and have helped her increase her income.  Today she works daily from 8am to 6pm, buying with cash from specialized stores that offer the best prices.  Currently she is applying for a Kiva loan, which she will use to buy hair dyers and a curling iron, in order to increase her services in the holiday season and to provide more dynamism all year around.  This will allow her to increase her income and benefit her family, which is made up of her husband and her four children between the ages of 4 and 12 years old.
