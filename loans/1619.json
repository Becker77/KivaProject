She is a real fighter of a woman who has dedicated a large part of her life to caring for her five children. Her primary sources of income are milk, vegetables and farming. Peris hails from Nyamira, Kenya, an area that enjoys favorable weather patterns that boost crop production in the area. Peris, being someone who is very ambitious and someone who always takes advantage of positive things, would like to capitalize on the good weather patterns experienced in the region and boost her farming. Being a hardworking mother, Peris has always ensured putting food on the table for her family. She also ensures she is able to take her children to school. Peris detests living in conditions of poverty and she has a plan to improve her standard of living. This is why she is seeking a loan of 41,600 KES in order to be able to purchase a dairy cow. This will help in producing milk and manure to be used on her farm. Milk from the cow will be sold to the local market and this means improved cash flow. The improved cash flow means that profits will be higher and she can comfortably take care of her family and take her kids to school. Through your loan, Peris will be empowered economically and will be able to improve her standard of living and those of people living within the area. Peris is very comfortable with the repayment plan and the monthly installments."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":393.26,"image":{"id":1747941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-04T21:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-18T21:50:06Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2944.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3118.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3209.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.71},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3499.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3601.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3707.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3815.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3927.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4041.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.36,"local_amount":6600.17,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6805.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824385},{"amount":72.69,"local_amount":6365.94,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6563.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264721},{"amount":76.39,"local_amount":6690.08,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6897.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459381},{"amount":80.29,"local_amount":7242,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7467.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.4,"payment_id":696587469},{"amount":82.88,"local_amount":7542.96,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7777.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.25,"payment_id":731022591}],"funded_date":"2014-12-05T12:46:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":808593,"name":"Tima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tima is a married mother of three children, all of whom attend school.

honest, and dedicated farmer. \r\n\r\nShe is based in Keera, a remote village in Nyamira. It is harsh living because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married, and, together with her husband, she has three lovely children. \r\n\r\nRoseline is a tough woman with tough skin, and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling. Her primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nThe Nyamira area has conditions that favor dairy farming. Roseline has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow, but the lack of capital has prevented her. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy another dairy cow. The dairy cow she intends to buy is not just an ordinary cow. It\u2019s a breed that produces between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. With this cow, she will produce more milk, which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Nyamira area is high, but the supply is low. So through this loan, Roseline is going to reap more and comfortably meet the demand. \r\n\r\nHer increased income will allow Roseline to provide a secure future for her school-going children by paying their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success. \r\n\r\nHer vision is to keep even more dairy cows so that she will be able to build a biogas digester, which would help her to save more energy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1747955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality exotic breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-04T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-18T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.59,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roseline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.91,"local_amount":6747.37,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6854.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824387},{"amount":68.58,"local_amount":6095.87,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6192.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264722},{"amount":61.25,"local_amount":5444.25,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5530.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459382},{"amount":33.99,"local_amount":3111.63,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3161.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.02,"payment_id":696587470},{"amount":27.31,"local_amount":2575.19,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2616.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.66,"payment_id":711505794},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":3562.87,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.51,"payment_id":731022592},{"amount":135.8,"local_amount":12462.82,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12660.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.4,"payment_id":752110823}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T20:21:05Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frederick Andrews","image":null}},{"id":808612,"name":"Mejumaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mejumaa is married and has two children, both attending school.

children. She is a youthful 32-year-old woman and a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nyamira, in the Nyanza region of Kenya. Roseline has been able to provide nutritious food for her family and is always ready to get what her family needs.  \r\n<p>\r\nWorking in the field is one of the most difficult jobs today because of the amount of effort needed to make progress; however, Roseline has done well despite the weather or the circumstances surrounding her. For the past fourteen years her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage and tomatoes and keeping dairy cows. She also runs a posho mill as a side business to supplement the meager income she earns from farming. \r\n<p>\r\nRoseline lives in a remote village that has poor feeder roads, so it is hard for her to get her produce to market quickly and efficiently.  Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. But because of her distance from the market, she has suffered many losses.\r\n<p>\r\nThis challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. So she has mobilized other woman in her village to join Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a 180,000 KES loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike, which will enable her to quickly transport more goods to market. She also intends to employ someone to drive the motorbike and help her in farm work.\r\n<p>\r\nThe benefits of this loan will be astronomical in that Roseline will seldom suffer losses due to delays in delivery. More fresh produce to market will mean an increase in her income. \r\n<p>\r\nFinding a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Roseline is relieved to know that Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva are there to help women make a change for themselves and others in the community. Through such institutions women can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. \r\n<p>\r\nRoseline looks forward to improving her living conditions and assuring her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future. Through this loan she is going to achieve these dreams.

Meet Margaret, a mother of seven who has defied the notion among her friends that farming is an old-fashioned way of earning a living. Margaret is a hardworking farmer from Igare Village in the Kisii area of Kenya. She is a committed wife. She has been doing mixed farming for the last 10 years and her main income sources are milk, eggs and crops. She is also engaged in other personal businesses. Margaret enjoys dairy farming, especially milking cows. She is contented with the farming way of life. Her ambition is to generate more income and take better care of the people who she looks after. Her main challenge is ensuring the proper health status of her animals. She says this takes a lot of commitment and attention. Margaret is requesting a loan to purchase an additional dairy cow. Dairy cows, over the years, have provided her a means of being self-sufficient. Now, with your loan, Margaret will get more dairy products from her cows, which will bring her extra income to keep up with her rising family expenses.

In addition she also does farming, which earns her another source of livelihood. She faces a major challenge of seasonality, especially during the rainy season when it becomes difficult to operate. She dreams of establishing a retail shop and a caf\u00e9 in the business.\r\n\r\nWith the loan that she is requesting of 50,000 KES, she wants to purchase stock of wheat flour, cooking fat oil, salt and sugar. She decided to join Yehu to access loans to boost her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1734867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

So, Khatuna plans to purchase a stock of cosmetics and perfumes and sell them in her free time, in her community. She will buy products at wholesale prices, and will sell them with price mark-ups. The new business initiative will give her a chance to tackle the financial difficulties and increase her monthly income. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the future, she will be capable of expanding her business that covers almost all of her customers' needs.

Their main clients are neighbors and friends, to whom they offer beer and food from their home, both individually and in bulk. \r\n\r\nThey are currently applying for a CrediKiva as their first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which they will use to buy drinks, as they believe it is necessary to boost their inventory so that they can offer better prices. They have to buy from providers in cash, so they need working capital. This is a benefit, since sales are also made in cash so it will allow them to easily recover their investment. Carlos runs the business every day from 8am-6pm; he is 65 years old and has two sons, 33 and 26, and two daughters, 40 and 38.

The 65-year-old mother of two is a small-holder farmer based in Cheptungei village, found in the North Rift region of Kenya. The secondary-educated entrepreneur runs a mixed-farm, where she keeps two fairly productive dairy cows that produce milk for both consumption and sale. \r\n\r\nAnna started farming in 1995. She farms on a 2-acre piece of land that belongs to her husband, whose professional activities have little to do with agriculture. She was doing it for subsistence, but recently switched it to commercial produce. \r\n\r\nThe income she made from this transition greatly improved her income status and enabled her to afford her children a better education at standard private schools. Anna has one employee to help her run the farm when she is attending her day job or doing her side job, which involves selling second-hand clothes for extra income. \r\n\r\nAnna is seeking a loan to purchase animal feed. She places more premiums on animal health and nutrition in her dairy business than on other factors. Animal feed has a lot to do with the proper composition of the animal products she sells to her customers. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking this loan to ensure that her animals have the proper feed composition that the animals require. \r\n\r\nThe returns from this investment will enable Anna to pay for her children's education expenses.

She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in rentals every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her improve her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan to buy computer accessories such as a printer, mouse and keypad and also to pay for the maintenance of her computers. It is important that all her computers are all working efficiently to ensure good service to her customers. Her income from her Internet Shop is a big help to support family\u2019s basic needs.\r\n\r\nAdora aims to buy more personal computers to grow her business. She wants her child to finish college and save for her old age. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Kapsowar area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nJane believes that farming is learned through experience, and little by little, she has been perfecting her techniques and abilities in this field. She is a mother of four school-going children whom she truly loves and greatly adores.

Jane passionately loves dairy farming and she has even nicknamed one of her cows. Since she has excess dairy food and enough space on her land, Jane has always wanted to buy another dairy cow, but the challenge that she has been facing is lack of finances. That is why Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Jane to turn their dreams into reality. \r\n\r\nJane believes that the loan will help her to satisfy the milk demand in her area and, through the accumulated profits, she will be able to realize her dream of developing her business into a large enterprise. Many women in Kenya are responsible for not only producing food, but also feeding their family.

She started pursuing her passion in the year 2008. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Kipsaiya, a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. She is a proud mother of two, lovely children. For the past six years she has been making a small living by practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income.<br \/><br \/>Catherine passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing capital to grow her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan, and she used it to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back, fully. She also benefited from training, and the impact of the first loan must not be underestimated.<br \/><br \/>Now Catherine is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, and Kiva lenders, to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The animal she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow capable of producing between 15 and 20 liters of milk, per day. A liter of milk costs 50 KES; this means the cow will be making 11 USD worth of milk, per day. From this loan, the life of Catherine will permanently change, and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children. She will also assure her aging parents of a secure future. Catherine waits for your kindness. Her farm will be maintained and go from strength to strength, with your help!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":511.33,"image":{"id":1748112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-05T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-19T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4832.01},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6262.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6445.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":130.93,"local_amount":11534.6,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":11823.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264727},{"amount":119.84,"local_amount":10557.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10821.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459387},{"amount":121.8,"local_amount":11050.72,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11327.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.64,"payment_id":696587475},{"amount":130.02,"local_amount":11903.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12201,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.1,"payment_id":731022596}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T10:22:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":808746,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanne is 42 years old.

entirely. Viola is a smallholder mixed-farmer based in Kapsowar, a remote village in Kenya. She is a mother of two lovely children and has been practicing mixed farming for the last 10 years. To earn a decent living, she sells eggs, milk, and greens and engages in numerous small personal businesses, including transportation. Only recently, she started seeing how she could make more money through sheep farming. In the past, she saw raising sheep as just a hobby. She wants to sell sheep meat and wool but assumes that the quantity she produces will not make economic sense. She needs to purchase more sheep. However, her biggest challenge today is limited funds to expand her business. Viola is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 from Kiva lenders, via Juhudi Kilimo, to purchase a quality breed of sheep. Future proceeds from the commercialization of her sheep farm are already committed to pay for her children's education. In the long run, she is confident that her efforts will translate into a better quality of life for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":315.51,"image":{"id":1748136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a good quality breed of sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-05T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-19T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.02,"local_amount":5315.98,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5600.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824395},{"amount":59.55,"local_amount":5103.9,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5376.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264728},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":2532.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2667.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459388},{"amount":62.07,"local_amount":5441.66,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5732.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.42,"payment_id":681377815},{"amount":64.28,"local_amount":5845.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6158.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.92,"payment_id":711505796},{"amount":31.68,"local_amount":2803.59,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2953.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.03,"payment_id":752110826}],"funded_date":"2014-12-09T16:35:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":808771,"name":"Kenga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kenga is a married woman with four children, all of whom attend school.

Tsisana and her son didn't have any source of income and were living in poverty until she opened a grocery store and started her own business. She found a place in a good location of town involved in trading business. \r\n\r\nBecause of her poor living conditions and lack of financial opportunities, Tsisana requested support from local financial institutions. Her loan application was rejected several times because of the family's poor living conditions. Tsisana requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Her tenacity and perseverance have allowed her to pull through, overcoming different obstacles that have arisen in her life. She is a mother of five from Nyamira, a remote town in the Nyanza province of Kenya. She has spent the past ten years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet. Alice is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her animals. She is so close with her animals that she has nicknamed one of them \u201cKipara,\u201d meaning no feathers on the head. \r\n\r\nAlice wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan of KES 30,000, which she will use to buy additional poultry. With your loan, Alice will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money. Alice is very concerned about her children\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay their school fees.

However, she has always had the strength to overcome it and get ahead with her children. She is a 53-year-old mother who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Miruka, a remote village in the Nyamira area of Kenya. She is happily married and has four children who depend on her for their basic needs. \r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years, Alice has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her primary sources of income are milk selling, egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Although she loves dairy farming, she passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d Alice sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. Because of her high-quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound and the demand has been overwhelming. \r\n\r\nTo be able to meet the demand, Alice is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry.

durante varios minutos debido a la falta de transporte. Los habitantes lavan su ropa y transportan agua a sus hogares desde el r\u00edo m\u00e1s cercano. \n\nEl grupo \u201cEl Casco\u201d est\u00e1 integrado por tres mujeres las cuales comparten un vinculo familiar, Do\u00f1a Concepci\u00f3n y Do\u00f1a Paula son hermanas y Floriberta es hija de esta \u00faltima. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron pues muy cerca del lugar donde se re\u00fanen hay una ex hacienda con un letrero que dice \u201cEl Casco\u201d.\n\nFloriberta prefieren que la llamen Flor, tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad y es muy amable, respetuosa, responsable pero sobretodo muy trabajadora, platica que vive con su mam\u00e1 ya que a\u00fan no se ha casado ni tiene hijos.\n\nFlor siempre quiso tener un negocio as\u00ed que hace 2 a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 a vender algunos dulces aprovechando que muy cerca de su casa hay una escuela. Cierto d\u00eda platicando con un vecino, \u00e9l le habl\u00f3 de VisionFund, le agrado la forma de trabajo de la instituci\u00f3n y cuando le dieron su primer pr\u00e9stamo compr\u00f3 productos de abarrotes y as\u00ed abri\u00f3 su propia tienda en casa. Sin embargo, al crecer el negocio y tener cada vez mas mercanc\u00eda, Flor tuvo que trasladarlo a la casa de su hermana, ya que es un lugar m\u00e1s amplio y se encuentra cerca de la parada principal de autobuses.\n\nFlor debe salir de casa muy temprano para abrir el negocio justo a las siete de la ma\u00f1ana ya que los clientes compran desde esa hora los productos necesarios para preparar el desayuno de sus ni\u00f1os \u201cEstoy ubicada en una buena zona y mis clientes est\u00e1n contentos con mi servicio\u201d. Flor necesita hacer una nueva inversi\u00f3n y comprar alimentos enlatados, az\u00facar, leche, pan, huevo, refrescos, jugos, detergentes, etc. para incrementar las ganancias y seguir ayudando con los gastos de su hogar. Generalmente ella compra los art\u00edculos en los supermercados del municipio porque logra conseguir algunos descuentos. \n\nFlor cumpli\u00f3 su sue\u00f1o de tener un negocio propio, pero sabe que aun puede mejorar: necesita un refrigerador m\u00e1s grande para los l\u00e1cteos y una b\u00e1scula porque la que se usa actualmente es prestada. Adem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda ofrecer productos de limpieza como cepillos, escobas, j\u00edcaras, etc. Espera lograr todo lo que tiene en mente con ayuda de los pr\u00e9stamos de VisionFund y KIVA.  \n\nPaula y Concepci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n seguras de hacer crecer el n\u00famero de sus borregos y mejorar su calidad de vida con un poco de ayuda y su mayor esfuerzo.\n\n*La foto fue tomada en el municipio donde viven las integrantes, se pueden apreciar los arcos y una parte de la iglesia, Flor es quien viste un abrigo de color rosa.\n","en":"To get to the community where the \"El Casco\" group is located, you have to walk several miles because there's no transportation.  The inhabitants  wash their clothing and get water to their houses from the nearest river.  \r\n\r\nThe \"El Casco\" group is made up of three women who share a familial link.  Concepci\u00f3n and Paula are sisters, and Floriberta is Paula's daughter.  They chose the group's name because very near where they meet there's a former ranch with a sign that reads \"El Casco.\"\r\n\r\nThey prefer to call Floriberta Flor.  She's 32, very friendly, respectful, and responsible, but above all very hardworking.   She says she lives with her mother because she's not married yet and doesn't have kids.\r\n\r\nFlor always wanted to have her own business, so two years ago she started selling candy, taking advantage of the fact that there's a school right near her house.  One day, as she was chatting with a neighbor, he told her about VisionFund.  She liked how the institution worked and when they gave her her first loan, she bought grocery products and opened up her own store in her house.  However, as the business grew and had more merchandise, Flor had to move to her sister's house, which is much larger and located near the main bus station. \r\n\r\nFlor has to leave her house very early to open the store at 7AM sharp, because at that hour clients buy the products they need to make breakfast for their children.  \"I'm located in a good area and my clients are happy with my service.\" Flor needs to make a new investment in the purchase of canned goods, sugar, milk, bread, eggs, soft drinks, juices, detergents, etc., to increase profit and keep helping out with household expenses.  She generally buys her products in the town supermarkets because she can get some discounts.\r\n\r\nFlor realized her dream of having her own business, but she knows it could be even better.  She needs a bigger refrigerator for the dairy and a scale because the one she has is rented.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Rahilla can now store her maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% higher than the market price at harvest. \r\n\r\nWhen asked, Rahilla  spoke of her  ambition to use the additional income to educate her children, eventually hoping to ensure her children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1639322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for children's school fees and uniforms, eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-05T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-19T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahilla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":17055,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":17055}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-05T17:14:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":803178,"name":"Maria Fernanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fernanda es una se\u00f1ora casada, tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad y sus 3  hijos tienen 3 a\u00f1os, 7 a\u00f1os y 3 meses, el esposo de Fernanda se dedica  atrabajar en el jornal y en la agricultura, ella se dedica a la crianza de animales, el cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para comprar chonchos ya que comenta que de aqu\u00ed le queda ingresos para apoyar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar y sobre todo para lo que necesiten sus hijos para ir a la escuela.","en":"Fernanda is a married woman.

She is requesting a new loan that she will use to purchase thread to dye with natural colorants (local plants, tree bark, corn husks). Her ultimate goal is to have enough income so that her children can complete the highest level of education and enter a profession.\r\n\r\nThe educational components of the monthly meetings of the Trust Bank have helped Telma and her friends. With the information that they receive through role-playing, games and drawings, the women learn about self-esteem and empowerment. The ladies learn to become effective business women with new information about business administration, budgeting, accounting, marketing and customer service. They also learn about common diseases, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants.

A friend suggested that she buy merchandise from catalogs and resell the merchandise for a profit.  She liked the idea and started a business buying and selling clothing and leather goods.  Betzy's main customers are her co-workers at a company where she herself now works and she says that seeing them every day makes collections easy.  She now buys the merchandise she sells, for cash, from stores in Barranquilla, Medell\u00edn, and Maicao.  Betzy is applying to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan that she will use to buy shoes, jeans and sportswear.  The investment will allow her to broaden the range of merchandise she sells and, in turn, increase her earnings.  For the future, Betzy hopes to buy a house for her, her 14-year old daughter and 4-year old son.

Her customers are largely drawn from family, friends and neighbors so collecting payment for sales is easy, she says.  She buys the merchandise for cash.

The group includes women who live in the same village. Their relations are marked by a spirit of solidarity and mutual help. The banc vilalgeois is on its 15th loan cycle, and thus most women have a long  experience as vendors, which is their main business activity. They also do farming on rain-fed land.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sona (the one standing on the left raising her hand) is our star borrower. She is married and has four children: one daughter and four sons. She is one of the founding members of the banc villageois. She is very energetic and works selling honey, palm oil and other products. She stocks up wholesale in Guinea Bissau in order to resell retail in the capital city of Senegal.\r\n\r\nWith her loan, she plans to buy 20 jugs of honey (20 liters\/21 quarts each) and 15 jugs of palm oil. \r\nThanks to her revenue, she plans to help her husband provide for family needs: food, schools fees, and healthcare expenses for their children. She also plans to bolster her savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1747195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is where Albina, who is 63 and married, lives. She had eight children from this relationship, one of whom passed away; the other seven are now adults, though one daughter still lives at home. Her husband no longer works due to health problems. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Albina is a very persistent woman who has always liked working to earn a living. She works in the commercial sector, selling clothing and shoes via catalog. Her sales method is door-to-door. She also recently started selling snacks on weekends, which has been successful. She works making her rounds three days a week, and also works every day from home. She sells her products on credit to her customers and collects the money every week. She has been getting ahead by doing this work for eight years. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to purchase supplies to prepare food, as well as to buy clothing and shoes because she has several orders. She is a founding member of the Communal Bank, which she likes because the loans help her to get ahead. Her dream is to keep moving forward.
