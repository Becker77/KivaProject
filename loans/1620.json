indigenous populations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SM2xd2GyDH8&feature=youtu.be\">watch this video<\/a>\n\nIn the Pur\u00e9pecha language, the phrase \u201cpukuri ambakiti\u201d means \u201cgood pine, pine resin tapper\u201d. This is also the name of a group of resin tappers in the indigenous community of Cher\u00e1n that is nestled in the heart of the mountains of Tarasco. This is the birthplace of the indigenous people who are of the Pur\u00e9pecha race, which is situated in the State of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. The representative for this group is Rosal\u00edo, who is also part of the Communal Council. \n\nRosal\u00edo is married and his wife is a homemaker. They have four children. His oldest child is 25 years old and the youngest is 16 years old. Pine resin has had a positive impact on his life. This business benefits his family by providing a 60% profit. Thanks to this industry, there is more business movement in the community, which has facilitated the trading of products among the resin tappers. This loan will be used and applied to the natural resources in the forestry industry. In other words, the entire planting process includes preparation, fencing, maintenance, and harvesting. This loan will also provide adequate support and care to the land that is currently producing resin. In addition, this will strengthen his business and allow him to devote himself entirely to the forest. His future plans include leaving the next generation everything that he had when he was younger so that they can enjoy the beautiful forest. His dream and that of his family is to rebuild what they had in the forest. \n\nThe one thing that he is most proud of is the work he has done. He feels fortunate to have the opportunity to walk and work in close contact with nature. Rosal\u00edo feels very proud to be part of a community that has attracted interest from people from other parts of the world who are concerned about the environment and making it productive. He would like to tell people who are lending to this project of planting commercial pine trees that the production of resin takes a bit of time, but once it starts generating income, the benefits can be reaped for more than 50 years. \n\nIn his opinion, Rosal\u00edo believes resin production can support the environment for more than 70 years and can continue to do so for many more years. He thinks that if we are beneficiaries of nature, then we have the obligation to preserve it. The challenges and obstacles are the same ones being faced by the community, so the inhabitants understand that they can live in the forest and have a productive pine resin business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":41700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1696884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Flexible Credit Study","Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"to buy and plant resin producing pine trees.

He runs a Zoona mobile money transfers shop in his hometown of Chipata.  He is married and has six children. He has employed two of them to work with him.\r\n\r\nJoseph has been running his mobile money transfers shop for almost two years. He says his business is the safest and cheapest way in which people can move their monies from one place to another. He is very pleased with his business because he has seen it grow in transaction value. He believes he has been able to stay in business because he is financially disciplined. Joseph accessed his first Kiva loan back in 2013. This loan was instrumental to his business as it gave him the capital he needed to serve his customers.\r\n\r\nJoseph says his biggest challenge is that he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his growing number of customers. He sometimes has to keep customers waiting while he goes around looking for money. This slows down business, as he has to turn away customers and lose out on valuable commissions. He is, therefore, requesting a Kiva loan so that he can grow his capital base and serve customers with larger amounts to transfer. \r\n \r\nJoseph is hopeful that once the Kiva loan comes in, he will be able to increase his working capital and make more profit so that he can continue to grow his business. He will use the anticipated profits to purchase a new computer to make his transactions even quicker than using his mobile phone. \r\n\r\nIn this photo, Joseph poses at his shop in Chipata.\r\n\r\nJoseph says this loan will go a long way in boosting his business. He thanks the Kiva lenders for the help to date.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1748181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to have more working capital to grow his mobile money business to service more customers in his community who need financial services","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chipata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-12-06T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-20T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T00:31:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":809210,"name":"Bonafe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2010, Bonafe learned about Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative and the financial assistance it gives start-ups.

She saw that he felt a strong fascination for electronic devices because from the time he was very young he liked to play with these types of things. \u201cI would take them apart, analyze their components and put them back together again\u201d. She suggested that he take a technical course in the repair and maintenance of electronic appliances. That is what Ricardo did, and today he has a business that he started in 1994. In it, he offers repair and maintenance services. His main customers are his neighbors, relatives, friends and people who are referred to him. He offers them his service for payment up front and he even offers them payment plans. He purchases his appliance replacement parts and components in specialized stores and pays for them up front. That is why now he is asking for a Kiva loan. It is the first loan he has taken out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy replacement parts for televisions, integrated circuits, and electrical resistors. This investment will guarantee that he can offer his services in a timely manner. Ricardo is 47 years old and has had his business for a long time. His goal for the future is to continue expanding it and making it capable to be up to date. At the family level, he wants to continue helping his siblings and parents, although his main challenge is to work a lot more so he can save. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1742623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy replacement parts for televisions, integrated circuits, and electrical resistors.

Loice is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticulture farming. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Loice is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change.

She is a 29-year-old smallholder farmer based in Kitale, which is a small rural town in Kenya. Mary and her husband are blessed to have five children. \r\n\r\nMary has been a mixed farmer for more than four years. She keeps poultry for eggs, dairy cows and grows maize and vegetables for sale. She also holds a day job and engages in small businesses on the side whenever an opportunity crosses her path. \r\n\r\nDespite the rapid fluctuation of prices in the market, Mary is very passionate and optimistic about the future of horticultural farming in Kenya. \r\n\r\nMary is seeking a loan to expand her horticultural farm. This move is quite a big deal for her. With your loan, Mary seeks to continue growing different varieties of crops but on a greater scale. The demand for vegetables and other greens in Kitale and other parts of the country is very high. Income from this venture will negate the high farming expenses she has to deal with currently. In the long run, with increased income, she will finally be able to satisfy her family\u2019s basic needs.

She is contented with the farming way of life. <br \/><br \/>Clare is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her children and family of a decent meal. The Kitale area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. <br \/><br \/>Being a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Clare feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her.

Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. \r\n\r\nSeliphen, however, is taking this a step further. She is seeking a loan to start crop farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes. The demand for vegetables and other greens is always high. Income from this venture will cover her current high farming expenses.

She's known as Mary in her community.  She's 33 years old and has lived in a common-law relationship with Jaime, who works in Mexico City as a helper in a vegetable stall.  Together they have formed a family with two children, who are currently in elementary school.\r\n\r\nJaime and Mary opened a small grocery store together six years ago.  They worked hard to save money to buy some sweets.  The business grew little by little, and they're selling more groceries all the time.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago they became familiar with VisionFund, for which they're very grateful because they continue to see improvements in the store.  Recently Mary started selling vegetables on the recommendation of her customers.  That way she earns more, and people who live nearby can get everything they need easily without having to spend money on transportation into town.  Mary always tries to find the best prices to benefit her customers as well: \"I love to serve them, and even more so because they're my neighbors and I've known them for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Mary would like to have a refrigerator, but she knows her consumption of electricity would go up too much.  Although this prevents Mary from selling dairy products, cold cuts, cold soft drinks, and so on, it doesn't keep her from continuing to grow.  Her store is located near an elementary school and a lot of mothers buy their children's lunches or other products they need to make lunch.\r\n\r\nMary needs to buy more merchandise to stock her store so she can be prepared for the end-of-year season, which is a good opportunity to increase her profits.  She's going to buy boxes of milk, soft drinks, cold cuts, dairy products, canned goods, and a few vegetables.\r\n\r\nMary's dream is to be able to have a stationery store.  It would be a good business for her because there's a school very close to her house.  With her profits she would be able to pay for her daughters' school expenses, because she wants to see them become professionals.\r\n\r\nJust as Mary has goals in life, so do the member of the group.  They're enterprising mothers who always do what they can to improve their children's quality of life.  Each one of them has a business and also needs a loan to invest.  Mar\u00eda Elena and Magdalena, for example, will also invest in their grocery stores, while Constantina, Mar\u00eda Juana, and Angelina with invest in raising their sheep.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the municipal garden.

In that area there are many greenhouses known as \"naves\" where families grow a lot of vegetables and legumes. In order to arrive at the community one has to walk kilometers because public transportation is sparse. The members of the group are Elsa, Gregoria, Pascuala who will invest in raising pigs, Alfredo in sheep, Cirilio in candy, Juan Carlos in a grocery store. They are very content and thankful to VisionFund and Kiva for the loan to invest in their businesses.<br \/><br \/>Berenice is also a member. She is an enthusiastic, friendly 21 year old mother of two children , one of whom attends school. She is known as Bere in her community. Bere and her husband Valent\u00edn began to plant crops 4 years ago, and they work long hours on their farm. They begin to work when the first rays of the sun lights their land. They prefer to take advantage of the day to tend to their vegetables. \"My greenhouse was made possible thanks to a government project\". Bere has taken advantage of this resource, and works to maintain her crops in spite of not having received any training with regard to the work. But with time they have found better techniques to obtain better results. She shares that in order to have better quality products, the land should be worked and one needs to known the right moment to fertilize the plants. Bere has a variety of vegetables that need fertilizer this month and she needs a loan to buy bundles of fertilizer. Bere is very happy growing her vegetables but what she enjoys the most is going out and selling to her neighbors. Every afternoon in her little cart she takes carrots, cilantro, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, radishes, spinach, etc. and fortunately the people always buy in good quantities because they enjoy the flavor and quality of her vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Bere is very excited with her business and she is saving her money so that she can finish improving her home as she is always thinking of her children so that they have what they need.

Jaime gets along well with his neighbors and has a good reputation, both personally and commercially, in the area. \r\n\r\nJaime has been growing coffee for 20 years and now makes his living with a coffee crop planted on 2 hectares [about 5 acres]. He has a lot of experience in coffee growing and grows a variety of coffee called Catimor that is disease-resistant. His current crop is 4 years old and in its 3rd year of production. Jaime's fields are located in the El Arenal community, also in Santo Tomas district. In addition to coffee, Jaime also grows other basic food crops and raises small animals like pigs, chickens, and guinea pigs, as well as cattle. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in maintaining and taking care of Jaime's coffee crop, which is currently in the flowering stage [the stage before the coffee \"cherries\" or beans are formed]. This will help him assure a good production for the 2015 season, which will in turn produce greater sales for him and bring in extra income that he can use to improve life for himself and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1541931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"maintain and take care of his coffee crop, currently in the flowering stage, to assure good production for the 2015 season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santo Tom\u00e1s - Cutervo - Cajamarca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2014-12-06T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-20T16:10:08Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.1,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1011.9,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3070.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":38.1,"payment_id":752074361}],"funded_date":"2015-01-13T09:30:15Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T14:59:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

Ella cuenta que antes de formar una familia con Adrian, ambos ya se dedicaba a la compra y venta de verduras, pero cuando comenzaron a vivir juntos ella pens\u00f3 que si sembraban las verduras, sus ganancias ser\u00edan mayores. Ahora tienen un peque\u00f1o invernadero donde cultivan nopal, cilantro, zanahorias, r\u00e1banos, espinacas, epazote, ect. y por lo general, todo el a\u00f1o tiene verduras y legumbres, los momentos en que no llegan a tener cosecha, se ven obligados a comprar. La pareja trabaja los domingos, lunes y martes, d\u00edas en los que salen de casa a las 4 am para llegar a la central de abastos con su mercanc\u00eda, para vender a las personas que buscan la verdura m\u00e1s fresca. En el mismo lugar es donde suelen comprar verduras en mayores cantidades a otras personas para poder revender. \u201cMientras mi esposo est\u00e1 en el puesto a m\u00ed me gusta caminar entre la gente porque as\u00ed vendo m\u00e1s\u201d. Finalmente la jornada en la central de abastos termina a las 6 pm, pero los d\u00edas que llega a sobrar un poco de verdura, recorren las calles de su comunidad para regresar a su casa sin mercanc\u00eda para que no pierda su frescura. \n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Tere es tener m\u00e1s espacio para sembrar m\u00e1s y dejar de comprar a otras personas en especial en las temporadas m\u00e1s importantes en las que sabe que puede mejorar sus ganancias, como el fin de a\u00f1o. Ahora precisamente necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar las legumbres que le faltan, aprovechar la buena temporada y as\u00ed poder terminar su casa de dos pisos. Poco a poco comenzar\u00e1 a ahorrar para pagar un terreno cerca de su casa e incrementar la cosecha.\n\nTere y los integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con VisionFund Y KIVA porque podr\u00e1n invertir en sus negocios.

The money will help us with our businesses,\u201d says this group that is made up of three people who live in a community that celebrates San Antonio de Pauda on June 13th. There is a very special procession, horse races, fireworks, and traditional food such as tacos, mole, tamale, and the local drink called pulque made from the agave plant.\r\n\r\nOne group member is 23-year old Mar\u00eda Teresa whose nickname is Tere. She has lived with her partner Adri\u00e1n for a year, and they have a young daughter who does not yet attend school. Even before getting together, Mar\u00eda and Adri\u00e1n were buying and selling vegetables. Then when they began living together, Mar\u00eda thought that if they grew the vegetables themselves, their income would be greater.\r\n\r\nNow they have a small greenhouse where they grow prickly pear, cilantro, carrots, radishes, spinach, herb tea etc. Generally they have vegetables to sell throughout the year, but when they have no produce they are obliged to buy it.\r\n\r\nThe couple works on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays leaving the house at 4am to get to the central market with their produce. They then sell it to people who seek the freshest vegetables.  In the same place they can buy produce in large quantities and resell it.\r\nWhile Adri\u00e1n stays at their stall, Mar\u00eda walks around amongst the people so she can sell more.\r\n\r\nThe day\u2019s work ends at 6pm but when they have vegetables left over, they sell the produce in the streets of their community so they don\u2019t return home with vegetables that have lost their freshness.\r\n\r\nTere\u2019s dream is to have more land on which to grow more vegetables so they can stop buying them from other people, especially at busy times, like the end of the year, when they can earn more money. Now she needs a loan to buy the vegetables they need, take advantage of the season, and finish building their two-storey home. Gradually she will start to saving up to buy some land near their home and grow more vegetables.\r\n\r\nTere and the other members of the group are very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva for financial help with their businesses. Santos sells Christmas ornaments, Juana jewellery, and Antonio clothing.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken on the steps of the local municipal bandstand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1742668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SanAntonioEnchisi,Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-06T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-20T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":31.13,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":560,"local_amount":7600,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":7637.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349923},{"amount":560,"local_amount":7600,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7637.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980637},{"amount":542.42,"local_amount":7600,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7637.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.58,"payment_id":624423790},{"amount":550.51,"local_amount":7600,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7637.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.49,"payment_id":636769123},{"amount":555.94,"local_amount":7600,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7637.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.06,"payment_id":649763907}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T13:50:53Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":809412,"name":"Julius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julius is a fifty-four-year-old married man with five children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.

Their farm will become a cleaner place to live since the piles of waste will be input in the biodigester, reducing the presence of flies and contamination of watersheds. <br \/><br \/>This loan represents 20% of the total cost of the biodigester; the remaining part is covered by a government subsidy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1749453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to purchase a 6-cubic-meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Aculco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2014-12-06T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-20T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4927,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4927}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":821,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T15:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":874.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595313293},{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":821,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":874.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610703917},{"amount":249.41,"local_amount":3285,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3497.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.61,"payment_id":665216379}],"funded_date":"2014-12-10T04:56:26Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T15:27:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Bradshaw","image":1722852}},{"id":809437,"name":"Barrio 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poverty in Guatemala is widespread and deeply entrenched. About half of the population lives in rural areas of the country that accounts for a large majority of the country\u2019s economically impoverished. Eight women, who live in the western highland town of San Marcos La Laguna, on the shores of Lake Atitlan, are committed to eliminating poverty and empowering themselves. They joined together this past March to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cBarrio 3\u201d meaning \u201cNeighborhood 3\u201d. The ladies have already received a loan from Friendship Bridge funded by KIVA investors and have successfully paid back the entire loan. The eight women and a new member of the Trust Bank are requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge that they hope will be funded by KIVA investors.\r\n\r\nWe previously reported on Juana who used her loan to purchase materials to sustain her backpack business. She makes these backpacks in various sizes and colors. She has just begun her second loan cycle. Another member of the Trust Bank, Maria Guadalupe, was elected Treasurer for this loan cycle. She is a  31-year-old single woman who works hard to meet the needs of her family. Maria Guadalupe is a weaver and embroiderer and creates beautiful traditional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d, and hand-made napkins. She wants to take advantage of special events like graduations and holiday events as business will increase. Maria Guadalupe requests a new loan to purchase a quantity of thread in various colors and textures, needles, and other necessary supplies. She wants KIVA investors to know that she is very appreciative of their support. As a single business woman, she would have great difficulty securing a loan else where.\r\n\r\nThank you, KIVA investors, for your kindness and generosity. We shall provide a follow-up in the very near future of the nine women in the \u201cBarrio 3\u201d Trust Bank."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":1749200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She also grows corn in the field behind her home. \r\n\r\nShe decided to invest in a biodigester in order to save money and take advantage of her animals' manure.  A biodigester is like a mechanical stomach. It is fed with organic material, which is decomposed by bacteria in an oxygen-free environment.  The purpose is to produce a renewable energy called biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) and other material that is mainly used as fertilizer.\r\n\r\nShe used to spend a large part of her income on wood and LP gas to supply her home and farm with energy.

Do\u00f1a Eva comenta que el buen trato a los clientes y el saz\u00f3n de la comida que prepara han hecho que todos ellos regresen acompa\u00f1ados de amigos o compa\u00f1eros de trabajo quienes a su vez recomiendan su cocina econ\u00f3mica. Eva levanta las cortinas del negocio de domingo a lunes de 8 am a 6 pm debido a que las personas acuden incluso a buscar comida para la cena. \n\nQuiz\u00e1 el reto m\u00e1s grande al que se enfrent\u00f3 Eva fue su temor a que el peque\u00f1o restaurante no funcionara, pero hasta hace un mes Do\u00f1a Eva s\u00f3lo contaba con un empleado y con el apoyo de Diego para hacer entregas de comida a domicilio y de comprar los insumos faltantes. Apenas hace unos d\u00edas, Eva tuvo que contratar a otra persona para ayudarle con el trabajo de la cocina. \n\nSin embargo, la cocina no es la \u00fanica fuente de ingresos de Eva. Desde hace 6 a\u00f1os tambi\u00e9n vende zapatos y ropa por cat\u00e1logo y sus clientes principales son docentes, trabajadores del ayuntamiento y de los ingenios debido a que ellos tienen un ingreso m\u00e1s estable el pago por su mercanc\u00eda es seguro.  \n\nActualmente Eva necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para mejorar su cocina, necesita comprar m\u00e1s ingredientes como aceite, arroz, queso, huevos, leche, chocolate en polvo, vainilla, canela, az\u00facar, jamaica, refrescos y gas para cocinar debido a que son los insumos que m\u00e1s utiliza. \n\n\u201cGracias a VisionFund  por la gran oportunidad que nos brinda al otorgarnos pr\u00e9stamos\u201d coment\u00f3 Do\u00f1a Eva. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada afuera de la cocina econ\u00f3mica, Eva viste blusa blanca y pantal\u00f3n de mezclilla y est\u00e1 parada delante de Beatriz quien viste blusa color rosa.\n","en":"\"Las Rosas\" (\"The Roses\") is the name that the members decided to give to their group, which was formed in order to be clients of VisionFund and invest their loans in each of their businesses. The community where the group is located is a producer of sugar cane, and the harvest season began recently and will last for six months.\r\n\r\nThe name of the group came from the liking that the borrowers have for roses. The members are:  Eva -- home-style restaurant, selling footwear and clothing by catalog; Paola -- selling cosmetics; Beatriz -- selling tacos; Tomasa -- selling cosmetics; Areli -- selling bed linens; and Nancy -- selling soft drinks.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Eva is a great woman. She has two sons. One is named Diego; he is an adult and helps her in the food business, which she opened five months ago. Rodrigo is 8 years old. Do\u00f1a Eva comments that her good treatment of her customers and the flavor of the food that she prepares has made everyone come back, accompanied by friends and work companions. who in turn recommend her home-style restaurant. Eva raises the curtains of the business from Monday to Sunday from 8 am to 6 pm, since people even come to her to seek food for dinner.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest challenge that Eva faced was her fear that the little restaurant would not succeed, but even a month ago, Do\u00f1a Eva only had one employee and help from Diego to make home deliveries and purchase missing ingredients. Just a few days ago, Eva had to hire another person to help her with the kitchen work.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, cooking is not Eva's only source of income. For six months, she has also sold shoes and clothing by catalog, and her principal customers are teachers. city workers, and mill workers, since they have a a more stable income, and payment for their merchandise is reliable.\r\n\r\nNow Eva needs a loan to improve her restaurant. She needs to buy more ingredients such as oil, rice, cheese, eggs, milk, powdered chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, fruit beverages, soft drinks and gas for cooking, since they are the supplies that she uses most.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to the VisionFund for the great opportunity that it offers us by granting us loans, \" commented Do\u00f1a Eva.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken outside the home-style restaurant. Eva is wearing a blue blouse and denim pants, and she is standing in front of Beatriz, who is wearing a rose-colored blouse.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":1739630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to
