She has a daughter who is 3 years old, and her business is the production of quilts.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, independent, active, responsible, and hard-working. She performs her business in the \u2018Pura Pura\u2019 zone, an area that is characterized by being the lung of the city as well as naturally connecting neighboring cities and towns, such as El Alto, La Paz, Zongo, and Chacaltaya through a variety of routes. It is an industrial type of neighborhood because there are a variety of industries in textiles, soft drinks, plastic, etc. It has a cold and dry climate during the whole year.\r\n\r\nAmalia has a dark complexion, short stature, and long, black hair that is tied back. Her mother tongue is Aymara and she speaks Spanish because of her business. She lives her life along with her 3-year-old son. They live in their own family home, which has electricity, potable water, and a sewage system. \r\n\r\nHer business is the production of patchwork quilts, which is an artisanal technique that consists of the union of small bits of cloth, which as a result gives very colorful surfaces which they employ for different jobs, especially bedspreads and quilts. \u201cMy business began as a way to reuse some different-colored cloth that we had. We then continued to perfect the technique, and now we work with wholesale and individual orders...\u201d she comments. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase and diversify her business with the creation of new products. She wishes to make an investment by means of the purchase of works materials wholesale, such as: thread, white cloth, 12.5 cm squares of red and blue cloth, rulers, various cutters, scissors, and pencils. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in 10 years that she has been performing this activity.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Amalia is requesting a loan for the purchase of work materials for the production of quilts and to fill her wholesale customers\u2019 orders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1742802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Patchwork","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase work materials for the production of quilts and to fill her wholesale customers' orders.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-07T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-21T02:10:01Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":511.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":598.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":617.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":662.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":649.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":692.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":699.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":722.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":749.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":760.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":802.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":817.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":841.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":874.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.52},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.37},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":634.15,"local_amount":4373.43,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4381.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157401},{"amount":815.85,"local_amount":5626.57,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5637.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554321}],"funded_date":"2014-12-07T15:23:55Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":809626,"name":"Richelieu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richelieu is a 42-year-old man from Concepcion, Iloilo.

30-year-old married man and a father of three children. Since childhood, he has been used to hard work on a field, helping his parents at home, taking care of livestock, and growing and harvesting vegetables and fruits. His parents did not have money to provide him with a college education, and this is why Nirmahmad continued to be involved in animal husbandry after getting married. He currently has 5 cows and 10 sheep. Nirmahmad is requesting this loan to buy livestock feed and increase livestock headcount. At the present time, he does not have the necessary sum of money, and this is why he came to MDO Arvand for financial support.

She was born and raised in a rural area and has been used to hard work on a field since her childhood. Her parents did not have money to provide their children with college education, and this is why Farzonai continued to be involved in animal husbandry after getting married. Now she takes care of livestock on her plot of land. She works day and night, during the cold and heat in order to feed her children so that they would not know needs.

He strings a new bracelet, sitting outside before the morning sun intensifies. It is a rare moment of leisure around the village of Kachibora, but even at rest Edwins's mind is burdened with the hardships of life in the Kitale area of Kenya.<br \/><br \/>Edwin is a mixed small-scale farmer and has been practicing agribusiness for the past nine years and has never looked back. For a living, Edwin sells milk and food products from his farm into the local market. He makes extra money with a small personal business. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products, and he really feels satisfied.<br \/><br \/>Although Edwin has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. Edwin is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kitale and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Edwin does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people, and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint.<br \/><br \/>With this loan, Edwin is confident that his income will increase, and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Edwin will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm. Through this loan, he will assure his large family of a secure future and improved living

Even with savannah plains and little human activity, there exists a farm that stands tall, a farm with over four high-pedigreed Freshian cows, producing over 40 litres of milk. It\u2019s quite an outstanding feat, considering the harsh terrain and other handicaps, like the lack of electricity from the national grid, and also because of being dependent on traditional methods of harvesting water. <br \/><br \/>Kiva lenders, meet Thomas, the man credited with the success story of the farm. He is a youthful 47-year-old farmer who is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience, despite personal challenges and his passion to support his four children as a primary caregiver. <br \/><br \/>The living conditions in the Kapsowar area are very tough, and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Thomas has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Thomas started practicing mixed farming and has been doing this for the past ten years. Thomas\u2019 sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. <br \/><br \/>The Kapsowar area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Thomas is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. <br \/><br \/>Thomas is very determined to succeed, and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his children. Thomas\u2019 dream is to provide a secure future for his children through paying tuition fees for them. Through your loan, you will help him realize his dream.<br \/><br \/>By lending today, you can improve Thomas\u2019 lifestyle and farming

Meet Edwin, a youthful 40-year-old budah (father), and a wise farmer who neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Edwin is happily married and together with his wife, blessed with four lovely children. \r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years he has been involved in mixed farming and his primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, and tomatoes and also, he keeps dairy cows. Edwin has been able to provide nutritious food for his family. Although he has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, he is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made him give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c he said. He mobilized other marginalized farmers in his village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring farmers like him. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Edwin is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting his produce to the market has been a challenge, hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Edwin is going to achieve his dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for men in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Edwin feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out marginalized farmers, so that they can gain respect and equality among their rich counterparts. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Edwin will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market.  He will also increase his sales volume, because he will be able to transport more goods to the market increasing his income level. Edwin is a farmer who is making a change for himself and for others in the community, because he intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Edwin will improve his living conditions and assure his children of a secure future. Please help Edwin, so that he can transport product timely to the market!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":386.24,"image":{"id":1750062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

This is the sad story of Kenneth, a youthful 27-year-old wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. He farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Eldoret, in the northern Rift Valley region of Kenya. Kenneth always says, \u201cI eat from my sweat.\u201d \r\n\r\nHe is based in Kosyin, a rural village. He has two children and has been practicing farming for the past five years, and has never looked back. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. Most of the small holder farmers in Kosyin village own approximately one acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Kenneth has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. Kosyin village is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition; this has hampered Kenneth from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Kenneth sells vegetables, milk and tomatoes which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price. \r\n\r\nKenneth is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely manner, and overcome the challenge of facing losses. Through the loan he will be able to do timely delivery which means he will not suffer losses; this will translate into an immediate increase in profits. Kenneth plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan fully and invest in a solid foundation for his family moving

They all live in the same village, and there is good rapport among the group members.\r\n\r\nMrs. Korka (the one seated on the far right raising her hand) is the star borrower.

She buys and resells staple products (such as soap, sugar, oil and tea) in order to resell them in her village.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan she would like to buy two bags of sugar at 20,000 West African francs each, 10 boxes of tea, some soap and various other first necessity products. The revenues will  allow her to bolster her savings as well as help her husband better manage everyday expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1747141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":" buy two bags of sugar, 10 boxes of tea, some soap and various other staple products.

With this talent in her hands, she decided in 2012 to start a business making indigenous-style shoulder bags, peyones (textiles that are placed over a horse saddle) and women's bags, which she sells to her friends and relatives who are located in a neighborhood of the municipality of Barranquilla. She works eight hours every day, is very committed to filling their orders and also to have a stock of products to offer to her customers. She offers them a payment facility and a wide range of models and colors in her designs which reflect the Caribbean culture. She makes her purchases in cash, so she is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she has gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to purchase raw material in bulk for her products: wool, synthetic yarn, and accessories. With this investment, Noralbis will increase her production and with this, she hopes to get representative sales since we are entering the holiday season in which her customers have more buying power and which can produce more purchases. Being a mother of two sons, ages 3 and 6, and a daughter, age 9, her family goal in the long term is to renovate her home to offer a better quality of life to her children, and she also dreams of opening a retail location where she can exhibit her products.

be young and starting a family is a challenge for many people in the Nandihills area of Kenya.  \r\n\r\nHello world, meet an inspirational smallholder farmer by the name of Samuel.  Born in the Nandi region of Kenya, Samwel has grown up to be a very hardworking and enterprising farmer.  His upbringing was not easy but at least he managed to finish his primary education. He is currently running a 4-acre mixed farm in Kilibwoni village with the unwavering contribution of his dear wife.  He keeps poultry, sheep and dairy cattle that give him eggs, meat and milk to sell. \r\n\r\nSamwel is seeking a loan to purchase land. Since 2000, when he ventured into farming, he has been relying on his parents farm to run the agribusiness, and still will continue to do so.  However, the business has grown and all the space is totally utilized.  With the loan investment, he will acquire additional land to facilitate the growth of his business. \r\n\r\nHis financial discipline led him to be appointed the treasurer of Kamaran Group (made up of farmers who save together and use the savings to access and guarantee loans of each member).  Returns from the investment will go toward loan repayment, setting up the new land and food for his family.  He will also use the money to meet all the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nSupport this hardworking man with a

His business is located in the \u201cVilla F\u00e1tima\u201d zone, an area known for the sale of coca leaf from the Yungas region. The coca leaf has always had a significant importance as a religious symbol within Andean spiritual beliefs. It is because of this that the (Spanish) Inquisition, during its removal of idolatry, prohibited coca leaf.   \r\n\r\nGrover is dark-skinned and short statured. His maternal language is Aymar\u00e1, which is spoken where he lives, but he speaks Spanish for business. He lives with his parents who make a living through farming \u2013 and with his brothers that work. They all live in a house made of adobe that has running water and electricity. \r\n\r\nHis business is the sale of the coca leaf. It contains proteins, vitamins and minerals that not only make it an excellent, nutritious option but also a way to cure various diseases. The coca leaf is a product that is consumed by chewing through beverages or teas prepared with coca extract.  \r\n\r\nThe nutritional values of the coca leaf are: containing alkaloids that produce stimulation in the body; possessing a large quantity of protein and vitamins, which give the body energy; having a high content of minerals such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorous, iron and zinc. It is rich in flavonoids and antioxidants that prevent the body from the onset of disease. The plant is not addictive and provides various health benefits. \r\n\r\nIts recommended use is for: relieving altitude sickness, preventing cardiovascular diseases, protecting against cavities, combating colon cancer, preventing obesity, eliminating depression, treating respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis, regulating blood pressure, curing stomach problems and controlling diabetes, among other things. \r\n\r\n\u201cI began this work because of the coca leaf\u2019s good characteristics and because its consumption is very popular and always in demand, so my business is thriving,\u201d Grover says. His dream is to improve his family\u2019s quality of life, and he wants to make an investment in his business by buying wholesale coca leaves to supply his customers at this time. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in five years that has been done for this work.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Grover is asking for a loan in order to purchase wholesale coca leaves to supply his seasonal customers.
