","en":"Dina is a resident of a neighborhood located in the southeast of Barranquilla. Beginning when she was a very young girl, she worked with her mother in a restaurant on their property. Many years later her mother decided to close it, however, Dina spent many years devoted to that activity. Currently, Dina can be found selling shirts, pants and leather items which is a better choice for work and leads to a better quality of life because being in charge of a restaurant requires more dedication and time which is very valuable to her and which she could not otherwise spend with her family. Her primary customers are her friends from her spouse's work, her neighbors and her friends who find it simple to purchase from her. DIna offers her products from 10:00am to 4:00pm every day. She completes her purchases from wholesalers located in the center of the city of Barranquilla in cash. Because of this situation she is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will invest the loan in the purchase of clothing and footwear with the goal of taking advantage of the December holidays. Likewise, she will also make adjustments to her sales site to make it have a more striking appearance. Dina desires that her children receive their college diplomas and she continues to help them get ahead so they can continue to progress. Because of this situation her greatest challenge is to continuously work with commitment and dedication. \r\n\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":532.19,"image":{"id":1743886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to purchase clothing and footwear that is suitable for her location.

He grew up in a village, and since childhood he helped his parents in the house and in the field, taking care of the livestock and gathering the harvest. His parents did not have enough money to give him higher education. Therefore Soli continued working with livestock breeding after getting married.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Soli has his own plot on land, on which he takes care of the livestock. He has five rams. He fattens them and then sells them. Soli works tirelessly in order to provide his children with a bright future and to have the opportunity to raise them and give them a good education. \r\n\r\nSoli takes a loan in order to purchase a ram and increase the number of livestock. He does not have the necessary amount himself. Therefore he turned to \"MDO Arvand\" for financial support.

","en":"In the community where the \u201cFamilia Cedros\u201d [Cedros Family] group is found, recently a corn harvest has started. Corn is the most important crop of the region, and is the fundamental nourishment for Mexican families all year. Having a good harvest requires a lot of work, effort, and dedication \u2013 but above all, a lot of money. The residents know that all of this investment is worth it, because in the future they will have the opportunity to enjoy the corn cobs, esquites [a Mexican snack made of corn, mayonnaise, chiles, and other ingredients], corn gorditas [a small Mexican cake made with corn flour, and stuffed with cheese and other ingredients], tamales, and traditional tortillas, made by hand by the housewives. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are Isidora, Ver\u00f3nica, and Reynarely, who share a family bond: Isidora is Ver\u00f3nica\u2019s mom, and Reynarely is Isidora\u2019s daughter-in-law. All three are very hardworking women, and they currently need a loan to be able to invest in their businesses \u2013 Isidora in her little sheep, Ver\u00f3nica in plastic household products, and Reynarely in fabrics and needlework.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica, or Vero, her nickname, is very talkative and friendly. She is the mother of two children (the 5-year-old girl is already in school). She lives in a domestic partnership with Rub\u00e9n, who works in the construction of houses. Three years ago, Vero was invited to sell plastic household products. This is how she came to know this industry, although she didn\u2019t feel very comfortable with the distributor. A little while later, she changed to a different business, which now sends the products to her residence, allows her to pay for the products in installments, and also gives her catalogs to market the products. She says, \u201cI love to work this way. The payments are very accessible and I feel very content working in this manner.\u201d Currently, Vero needs to invest in buying more plastic products to fill her customers\u2019 requests. \r\n\r\nVero takes advantage of all of the meeting places to leave her catalogs and sell her products. The loan from VisionFund will help her even more, considering that the end-of-year season is an excellent time to sell and make good earnings. Vero dreams of increasing her level of sales in the business. To succeed in this, she needs to form a group of 8 sellers. She will work to succeed in this goal because she knows that, this way, she will be able to help her husband with the household expenses, and will be able to make some renovations to her home.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the garden of the municipality where the members live. In the back, one can see the fountain, which is the center of the garden. Vero is the first one on the left-hand side, and she has her youngest son in her arms."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3075,"image":{"id":1742639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more plastic products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Concepci\u00f3n chico, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-08T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-22T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":35.06,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reynarely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isidora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":9740.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10184.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10724.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":11350.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":713.16},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":745.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":713.18,"local_amount":9741,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9749.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349927},{"amount":745.7,"local_amount":10185.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10193.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980641},{"amount":762.29,"local_amount":10724.21,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10733.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.88,"payment_id":624423794},{"amount":818.77,"local_amount":11349.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11359.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.18,"payment_id":636769127}],"funded_date":"2014-12-08T16:59:24Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cristina Bleicher","image":1721919}},{"id":810243,"name":"Juliana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliana, 60 years old, lives in Liloy, Zambo.

Now I understand, it was just a dream of a small girl, but my parents tell me to dream big and never give up on them.

My dream became my goal and I planned to realize my goal. At first I started learning English by myself, because we didn\u2019t have an English teacher in our rural school. In summer, while my classmates were having a holiday and fun, I was taking English courses in Bishkek, far from my home. Secondly, the big obstacle was my family\u2019s financial situation. We were short of money and I could get financial support in case I entered AUCA and received high scores. I did it and now have a chance to apply for a Kiva loan. \r\n\r\nMy mother is a teacher in our rural school and my father is a farmer. We grow fruits and vegetables, have livestock to implement meat and sell it at the market. My father\u2019s income is not stable as it depends on climate conditions and the richness of the harvest. Our family\u2019s income is mostly spent for my grandfather\u2019s treatments; he has a permanent paralysis of his legs and gets treatments every 3 months. The remaining money is enough just for daily necessities. I know it\u2019s hard for my parents to afford my education at AUCA. So, why do I study at AUCA and make my family\u2019s life harder? Just because I want my dreams to come true in order to be able to dream in the future and believe in their implementations.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1748566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

My parents want to give me all the opportunities they can, but the reality of our situation is that they will never be able to pay for the type of education I dream of: the type of education, which changes your life when you work hard. Because of my family\u2019s situation and my strong desire to better myself, I am applying for a Kiva loan.\r\n\r\nMy family lives in Aral, a small village in the Talas region of Kyrgyzstan. We are four people in it: my father, my mother, my brother and me. Both my parents receive a pension due to their health problems, but this money is not enough even for their own medicine. After finishing the high school, my brother didn\u2019t go to the university because of the same problem and works as a construction worker in Bishkek. It is almost impossible to find a job in our village, and even harder without a higher education. Thus, now my brother is the only person in our family, who does his best to support it. I understand that his work will not last in construction and I have to rely on myself, do my steps to the brighter future.\r\n\r\nLast year I was a lucky student at New Generation Academy of AUCA, who won the full scholarship, received stipend and lived in dorm for free. This chance gave me a belief that if I study and try not being afraid, I can achieve my goals through education, what may redeem the position of my family. \r\n\r\nThrough Kiva loan, I would be able

Yenis started with an 'estadero' (where people drink liquor and dance) which caused a lot of physical exhaustion from the grueling schedule that is required in this business format. For the above reasons she decided to start a fast food stall and restaurant which has been operating since 2012 and has achieved the expected results.\r\n\r\nThe main customers are the employees of nearby businesses in the sector and passers-site who wish to try these delicious dishes prepared with love and dedication by Yenis.  The menu is varied meals.  She prepares lunches and fast foods like hot dogs, sandwiches, and roasted corn.  She works two shifts depending on the days of the week; Monday to Wednesday, she is open from 7 am to 3 pm and Thursday to Sunday she is open from  3 pm to 1 am.\r\n\r\nAll sales are canceled in cash, which for her loyal customers, also gives ease of payment.

She sells vegetables on foot in various markets in the southern part of the city, like those in La Costanera, San Miguel and Achuamni. These markets are held once a week and the sellers come together in an area where they offer their products in the street, in trucks or on foot.

Her dream is to have a bigger business and she wants to invest in a vehicle to transport her vegetables to the markets, because it's very hard to do that and take care of her kids. This is the third cycle of loans with the institution in the 20 years she has been in business.

Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. In 2008, the couple started working on a run-down farm. Today, they are making money off the poultry and dairy animals they raise and also the maize and vegetables they grow. Patrick has further invested in transportation services to reduce their transportation costs and make money offering the service to other farmers. \r\n\r\nPatrick loves to dairy farm, especially since it was always a life goal of his to be a farmer. His wife understands this and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm's success to date happen. Patrick is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya. However, not all are good producers of milk. In fact, very few are. Cattle aside, the tastes and preferences of milk in the market is really growing in diversity in Kenya. Drinking milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass, we now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. Today, milk consumers are spoiled for choice. In the market, we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as soy, almond, rice and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like Patrick to pick these shifts in the market and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that their product qualities adapt to the changes in consumer preference. \r\n\r\nPurchasing a pedigree cow goes to show how Patrick is keen on controlling lameness levels in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average and the milk quality is second to none in the market. He anticipates that feeding will be his highest cost of milk production. This, to him, is accepted because to get cows that milk well and remain healthy, they have to be fed properly.\r\n\r\nYour loan will make a significant difference to Patrick's farm profitability. The couple will make use of the returns from this investment to pay for the loan, pay for their children\u2019s education and the rest will be reinvested in the business. It has always been their ambition to share their passion about farming with their children.

He is 25 years of age, a hard worker and always says, \u201cI eat from my sweat.\u201d He is based in Pioneer, a rural village in Eldoret, and has no children. He has been practicing farming for the past two years and has never looked back. \r\n\r\nHis primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. Most of the small-holder farmers in Pioneer village own approximately half an acre per household, and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Thomas has been practicing mixed farming and he enjoys the income he gets, but he has been facing challenges delivering his products to the market. \r\n\r\nPioneer village is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition; this has hampered Thomas from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Thomas sells vegetables, milk and tomatoes, which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price. Thomas is seeking a loan to buy another motorbike that will help him deliver his products to the market in a timely way so that he can overcome the challenge of facing losses. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan he will deliver the products on time to the market and this means he will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. Thomas plans to employ someone who will help him on the farm and deliver products to his large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan fully and invest in a solid foundation for his family to come.\r\n \r\nThomas says that his greatest desire is to continue fighting to generate financial stability and to provide his parents and siblings with better living conditions and well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1750590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy another motorbike to be used in delivering his products to the market on time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-08T03:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-22T03:40:05Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Annie Wazer","image":null}},{"id":805468,"name":"Rosario Del Pilar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosario tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada y tiene 7 hijos mismos de los cuales 5 aun viven en su casa, y son 3 los que asisten al colegio, Rosario es una se\u00f1ora colombiana que ya vive 10 a\u00f1os en Ecuador y comenta que se encuentra mas tranquila que en su pa\u00eds natal, ya que en Ecuador si hay donde trabajar y sobre todo el pago por su trabajo es justo, el cr\u00e9dito lo va a invertir en la compra de  chanchos y de ah\u00ed se apoya en los gastos diarios de sus hijos, su esposo es jornalero y la aspiraci\u00f3n de Rosario es mejorar su negocio y comprar chanchas paridoras ya que comenta que este negocio es rentable debido a que se puede vender las cr\u00edas.\n\n","en":"Rosario is 44 years old.

I live with my grandparents and my mother. Grandparents are pensioners at the age and my mother is at home due to her health condition. She gets a small compensation because of it. Before, my mother used to be a hairstylist and worked in one of the beauty salons in Bishkek. One day she felt ill, had five operations, and then stayed at home. I know that all her hopes rely on me.\r\n\r\nWhile studying at school I did all my best to grasp knowledge. I was responsible and interested in taking part in various school activities like competitions, Olympiads, contests, and festivals. I managed to succeed in \u201cReciting\u201d devoted to A.S.Pushkin, Olympiad in English, and contest in Russian grammar named \u201cGramotei,\u201d and took a leading part in 8th All-School City Festival in Ethnography.

He started to raise pigs five years ago, and at the end of the year, he will sell more than 50 pigs. So far, he has about 30 pigs to raise and they will be sold in the near future. He pays for the whole family's daily costs with the money he earns via raising pigs.\r\n \r\nLast year, the cost of raising pigs increased, and his parents are getting older and cannot make a living for themselves. In order to improve their living environment and standards, besides raising pigs, Wei hunted for another job as a chef in a restaurant. \r\n\r\nWei requested 20,000 from MicroCred.

The group has 8 members and is directed by a governing board on which Se\u00f1ora Heydi sits as treasurer. The members of the group undertake a diverse range of work: macram\u00e9 blanket making, running a general store, vegetable buying, and the sale of cocoa, food, joists and beams, and traditional Andean skirts. \r\n\r\nThis loan will benefit a group of small business owners of which Se\u00f1ora Heydi is a member. She has indicated that this is her first time working with Pro Mujer, and that she was invited to join by a promoter of Pro Mujer who came to visit her in her home. At the moment, she has a business which produces and sells beams and joists for construction. She tells us that she learned this business from her parents, as when she was a girl she helped out with the family business. Now that she has a family of her own, she has decided to start her own business. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to increase her capital, buying cement at wholesale, which she plans to purchase from wholesalers in El Alto (a city neighbouring El Paz). After preparing it for sale, she will sell it in the markets of her community. This type of work allows her to make a better income to help her family, since she is single and lives with her parents. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answered that she likes the training courses that they offer.

Her business is the sale of natural health products. She is a good mother, enterprising, responsible, generous, kind, patient and hard-working.   Julia's business is in the  \"July 16th\" area, which is known for its well-attended market which takes place on Thursdays and Sundays, where one can find everything from a sewing needle to a tractor for plowing.  The climate is cold and dry with an average temperature between 2 and 18 degrees Centigrade in the course of day.\r\n  \r\nJulia has brown skin and is short in stature.  She dresses in traditional style wearing a hat, shawl and multi-layered skirt.\r\n Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1, and she speaks Spanish through general knowledge and for business purposes.  She spends her life with her husband who earns a living in interprovincial trnsportation as a salaried chaufffeur, and with her children.

Her products include a milkshake which is like a  main meal because it has lots of protein, but  best of all  helps to make one well outside and inside.  Among the items she sells are ones for cancer treatment, for colds, and for many illnesses because of providing complete nutrition.  All this must be watched over by an authorized distributor.\r\n  \r\n\"My business is selling natural products to relieve every kind of problem; they are guaranteed because the customers return to buy them from me again and again,\" she comments.  Julia's dream is to have a store as her fixed place of sale and she wants to make an investment in her business by buying natural health products wholesale, to fulfill her customer's needs and take advantage of the end of the year sales.  Julia has been in business for seven years, and this is the first loan she has sought with this institution.

To be able to save money for her semester fees, Maysa used to take all of her classes three days a week and stay at home for the rest of the week. By doing that, she saved a little bit of transportation expenses. She also convinced her mom to start a small business at home selling snacks and some basic food items to make some money that she saved to pay for her university fees.\r\n \r\nHer plan after graduation is to find a job in one of the schools and to get a higher degree in the same field.

The elder son of Dulani is taking pharmacist training in a private institution, and the other son and daughter are continuing their studies in local schools. <br \/><br \/>Dulani hails from a poor family. For the last ten years, she has been running a general grocery shop along with vegetable vending. She earns a monthly income of Rs. 5,000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family, business, and educational expenses. Dulani wants to grow her business to earn more income. <br \/><br \/>To give a secure life to her children, she has also admitted her elder son for a pharmacist training course in a private institution. So, the present loan will be used to purchase study materials and pay the tuition fees. She has also planned to use a part of the loan for purchasing lentils for her general store. <br \/><br \/>Dulani hopes to give better education to her other son and daughter and construct a good house for her family. <br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are doing stone chopping, vegetable cultivation, and broom businesses for their livelihoods."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1750689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase study materials and pay for tuition fees for her son.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"RISIGAON, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-12-08T16:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-22T16:00:08Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahalya    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dropadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dulani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dusila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Labanga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Menaka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasmita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shasi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":152000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":152000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T04:42:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":810419,"name":"Aisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aisha is a freshman at the American University of Central Asia, in the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication.

She works hard to augment their income to support and meet the family's daily personal and household needs and to send her child to school. \r\n\r\nRemedios has operated a variety store for a number of years already. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Remedios earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of PHP 1,200 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, Remedios is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan which she will use to buy grocery items, such as sacks of rice, cookies, noodles, pasta, soda, and other grocery items. She expects an increase in sales since Christmas is fast-approaching. Her earnings is the income source to meet the family's daily expenses and to send her children to school. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given to her. She is wishing everyone a blessed Christmas!\r\n\r\nRemedios aims to grow her business and hopes to own a big grocery store someday. She strives to hard to give her children the best education and prays for a quiet and happy life. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

an agricultural institute, but she is an accomplished farmer from the Kapsowar area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. She is happily married and, together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with one child. For the past 15 years Salina has been involved in mixed farming, sheep farming, and goat farming and because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. \r\n\r\nSalina has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices have been going up in the recent past, so Salina, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will get not only milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. \r\n\r\nSalina said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural-based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Salina hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products.

She is married to Remy, a tricycle driver, and has three children who are in college, high school and elementary school. She and her husband manage their household and they both work hard to provide for their family and support their children's education.\r\n\r\nChristina has been selling fish for a number of years already. She buys fish from a wholesaler at a local fish port early in the morning and sells it by the kilo at the town market. Many patrons prefer her product since they are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also has a tricycle, which her husband drives to provide transport service for additional income. She earns a minimum of 1,300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue and expand her business she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan, which she will use it to buy more barrels of fish. She will also use part of the loan for the maintenance of her tricycle unit. \r\n\r\nCoron, Palawan is one of the best island in the Philippines. It not only offers the best beaches in the world but also offers the freshest supply of fish. Her earnings in her fish stall are a great help in meeting the family's everyday needs and for the schooling of her children. Christina hopes for her business to flourish so she can help her children achieve their dreams. She aims to send her children to the best schools until college. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1750672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Rift valley. He and his lovely 28-year-old wife own a small piece of land. They have been blessed with three lovely  children. \r\n\r\nThey have raised dairy cattle and grow vegetables for 10 years. Their main income sources are selling milk and crops. They recently ventured into a farm-produce-motorcycle-transportation business. \r\n\r\n David is seeking a  40,000 KES loan to grow his horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, as  evidenced  by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to afford David access to a loan facility that will aid him to grow his horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, David\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":370.5,"image":{"id":1750725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand his  farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-08T17:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-22T17:20:06Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":6168.12,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6269.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824437},{"amount":69.89,"local_amount":6212.3,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6314.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264748},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":6463.77,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6570.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459407},{"amount":74.76,"local_amount":6839.64,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6952.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.19,"payment_id":696587493},{"amount":78.52,"local_amount":7248.45,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7367.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.03,"payment_id":731022615}],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T11:13:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":810440,"name":"Hernanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hernanita is a 28-year-old married woman with four children.\r\n\r\nShe has earned a living growing  rice for 7 years.

He works at a butcher shop and buys meat from his neighbors for resale. He is also involved in animal husbandry to provide an additional source of income for his family. He started his business 17 years ago and today has 4 cows and a stock of 700 bales of hay.

widow and has 3 children. Uulkan has a secondary education. She is retired and, to provide the primary income for her family, has been involved in farming and animal husbandry since 1999. Thanks to Uulkan's persistence, drive and hard work, today she has 2 cows and 0.60 hectares of land, where she grows cotton. The monthly business income amounts to about 4,000 som (KGS). Uulkan also receives a pension, but this money is not enough for a decent life, and this is why Uulkan, in anticipation of spring field work, requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy seeds, fertilizers and livestock. Uulkan intends to improve her family's well-being and direct the earnings from the loan toward developing her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1752304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy livestock, seeds and fertilizers in order to increase her income and improve her family's well-being","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nooken district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-12-08T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-22T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uulkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50393.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500329}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T19:52:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":810511,"name":"Olia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olia is 46 years old.

The decision was made the growing needs of their family which her husband could no longer support alone. Her husband works as a construction worker and receives a very meager salary for a hard-days work. \n\nIn 2013, she came across SEED and availed a first loan amounting to PhP 5,000. She used it for additional capital to her eatery business serving breakfast items to customers. From the additional capital, she earned PhP 700 daily which doubled her earnings. Gaining more customers, on her her second loan, Evelyn was able to open a small retail store. As this was a new endeavor, Evelyn encountered problems with customers taking credit and not paying back on time.  This however did not hamper her operations. Instead, she went on with the retail store business and discussed with customers taking credit the need to pay her back in time for her to be able to replenish her stocks and continue to provide credit to them. To date, her eatery and retail store business are still running well, having learned fully from the lessons of giving credit to customers.\n\nOn her third loan now, Evelyn wants to capitalize in electronic mobile phone load to add up to her eatery and retail store business. She will be the first one to open that kind of business in the area so she expects that this will be a great help to increase her income. Mobile phone is common place in the area and Evelyn was able to establish that customers need to walk at least 15 minutes towards the main road in order to access or buy this service. \n\nEvelyn values studying the business landscape in the area where she lives and run her business. She is also decisive in resolving whatever concerns she face in her business. Due to these, Evelyn was able to diversify her business and therefore also improve her family's condition of living. Before, Evelyn's household did not have had no electricity nor water connections of their own. They merely relied on neighbors selling out electricity and water on a sub-meter basis. However, with the earnings from her businesses, Evelyn was able to apply and acquire their own electric and water meters. \n\nEvelyn dreams of having her kids finish college and attain a better life than what they have now. She is certain that with the continuous improvements in her businesses this dream will ultimately come true."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1752103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
