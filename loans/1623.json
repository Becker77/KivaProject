The above picture presents to you Everlyne, who lives in the Nandihills area of Kenya, also known as the Home of Champions because it produces so many elite runners who have broken so many world records. \r\n\r\nEverlyne is the mother of two lovely angel-looking boys and has been doing farming for the past ten years. Through dairy farming and poultry keeping, she has been able to produce milk and eggs. Everlyne is a very dedicated farmer who has a never-say-die attitude and enjoys every bit of farming because, through farming, she is able to take care of her family\u2019s needs and wants.  Everlyne also runs the only posho mill in her village. Although she experiences challenges in farming, her attitude keeps her going. Enjoying what she does, she has even nicknamed her cow. \r\n\r\nEverlyne is seeking a 50,000 KES loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used to cut hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forages. This assists the animal in digestion and prevents the animal from rejecting any part of the food. With the loan, she would be able to increase her milk productivity and also increase her income levels, hence reducing the poverty level that is currently facing her. Everlyne\u2019s biggest dream is to get out of this poverty level, and this loan will be a stepping stone toward improving the living standards of her family and increasing her income level."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1750923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy a chaffcutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-08T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-22T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.65,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.29,"local_amount":7938.53,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8248.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824441},{"amount":89.93,"local_amount":7820.39,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8125.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264750},{"amount":42.54,"local_amount":3699.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3843.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459408},{"amount":92.88,"local_amount":8257.61,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8579.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.08,"payment_id":681377827},{"amount":241.71,"local_amount":22284.37,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":23154.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.57,"payment_id":711505811}],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T14:33:13Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":810597,"name":"Kazungu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kazungu is a married mother of three children, all of whom attend school.

But it is much more than an economic activity. Farmers like Joan are stewards of Kenya\u2019s countryside and provide the citizens with the option of buying locally-produced food. \r\n\r\nJoan started farming in 2007 after the country suffered post-election violence. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his 1 acre, she has grown the business dramatically. She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines and motorcycles, to help her run the farm. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops such as maize. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in a sector that feeds the population. \r\n\r\nJoan is seeking a loan to purchase more land. Her operations are growing consistently, eating up the available space.

This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I am from the warm and beautiful country of El Salvador. Surrounded by mountains, it is a privileged place in the shadow of the Cerro Miramundo with the coolness of the Cerro el Pital. Tourists interested in handicrafts visit our area in the Department of Chalatenango. My designs are created with great care and delicacy. Before they are finished, they pass through the hands of designers, carpenters, painters, varnishers and packers. For the most part, these people combine their craft work with their domestic chores. This lets them take care of their families while earning an income, which permits a better quality of life for the family and community.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your support through this microcredit. It means I'll be able to stock up on raw materials and have constant work to do.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Maria's hand-painted pinewood carvings on the NOVICA site:\r\n\r\n<a

He does his work in the \"Cruce Villa Adela\" zone, a strategic location characterized by connecting the various zones of the city through all sorts of transportation, where the people gather to get transportation to their homes, with a cold and dry climate with an average temperature of 2-12 degrees centigrade during the day, all year, at an average altitude of 3800 meters above sea level. \r\n\r\nWilmer is tanned, short, has short black hair, his native language is Aymar\u00e1 and he speaks Spanish. He has his life in his mother's house, with his partner and their small baby. They live in their own house, made of brick and cement, and which has drinking water, electricity and gas services. His business is a body shop and paint shop for cars. His beginnings were as an assistant to his father who works in the same field, and currently he is in charge of painting stripes, flattening out dents, fixing vehicles damaged in an accident, changing the color, etc. The tools that he uses most are screwdrivers, bodywork hammer, ball peen hammer, mallet, hammer file, body file, nylon hammer, wood hammer, rubber mallet, chisels or cold chisels, punches and nail pullers, impact driver, sandpaper, and others. \"Tell me what color your car is and I will tell you what it is like, and what it says about you, and what colors are safest...It's clear: the color of your car paint job is very important...\" he says. His dream is to have a shop known for its good work and he needs to make an investment in his business by purchasing a compressor, which helps to increase the pressure, to spread and spray the paint over the car's surface. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the year that he has been doing this work independently. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Wilmer asks for a loan to purchase a compressor to paint cars and, with the profits, to care for his family.

Tecolutla is one of the closest beach to Mexico City and much of its economy is based on attracting people from the city. Joel is a fisherman with a variable salary who gets better paid for the fish in the peak seasons.  Ernestina is married and contributes to the household by cooking for fisherman and tourists. Her income depends as well on the season and reputation. She believes that if she is able to use a blender for her cooking, light the wooden table where she serves her customers at night, and put some music with a small radio, her sales would increase. She already have a small solar system they purchased through ERES Energ\u00eda a year ago, and previously had a large solar panel that was a gift from a far away relative. This solar panel did not have the necessary components to work as a whole. She learned about ERES Energ\u00eda's new rescue program and decided she wanted to purchase a maintenance plan, battery, charge controller and LED to get her Solar Home System working. Her alternative is to use a fuel-oil power plant to fulfill their energy needs but it was not only very expensive (35% of their income), but noisy and polluting. The repaired solar system will allow Ernestina to save money spent in energy per month, while reducing the noise and pollutants.

Despite her hardships, Marilyn has taken on the responsibility of raising her fianc\u00e9s two teenage children, helping her own son through school as well as supporting her niece and nephew after the passing of her sister. Marilyn is trying to make her home as safe and energy efficient as possible for her family by replacing the gas water heater currently installed in her home. Due to the heavy water usage of Marilyn\u2019s large family, the cost of gas for the water heater is significant. She is hoping to not only reduce the monthly utility cost,  but also provide a safer living environment by installing a much more efficient solar water heater. \n\nMarilyn will use this loan to finance a safer, more efficient, solar water heater for her home. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1278.75,"image":{"id":1731066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for a safer, more efficient, solar water heater for her home.

(pictured right) is a married woman who has suffered a few setbacks in recent years. Zamarys\u2019 husband, Michael (pictured left), unfortunately became disabled and was deemed unable to work; therefore, she became the main provider for the household. It has been difficult for Michael to obtain disability, and during this time the couple was faced with the choice of giving up their home or losing their car. The couple decided to turn in their car and shift expenses to save their home. Zamarys has since found employment that better supports the household until her husband can recover. Living on one paycheck does not allow any out of pocket funds to make necessary repairs to their home, such as replacing an old water heater that is no longer repairable. Zamarys has little credit history as she normally does not borrow funds. \n\nIn order to lower the cost of their energy bill, Zamarys will use her KIVA loan to not only buy a new solar water heater to replace their old unserviceable unit, but to also help rebuild her credit.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1008.37,"image":{"id":1735275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Even with savannah plains and little human activity, there exists a farm that stands tall, a farm with over two high-pedigreed Freshian cows, producing over 20 litres of milk. It\u2019s quite an outstanding feat, considering the harsh terrain and other handicaps, like the lack of electricity from the national grid, and also because of being dependent on traditional methods of harvesting water. \r\n\r\nKiva lenders, meet Mathew, the man credited with the success story of the farm. He is a loving husband with two children ,and has been farming for the past 10 years. Mathew passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that he knows his cows, each individually, because he works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. He and his wife have even named one of them \u201cBirirmet.\u201d \r\n\r\nBecause he loves the cows, he runs his operation by four simple rules that have kept him and his herd happy. The rules are: breed them well, feed them well, clean them well and milk them well. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that he engages in to make ends meet. The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve. He is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo serves poor smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to the farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like dairy cows, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. \r\n\r\nThrough this loan from Kiva lenders, Mathew will buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income, and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan, and will also go toward the education of his children. \r\n\r\nHe will also benefit from the cow manure, which will be used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan, he will also be able to build a bio-gas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. This loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions. Mathew waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":396.21,"image":{"id":1751302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a good quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T03:50:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.55,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mathew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40330,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2854.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2937.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3023.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3202.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3296.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3392.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3491.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3593.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3699.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3807.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3918.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.2,"local_amount":6919.19,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6975.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824447},{"amount":74.11,"local_amount":6641.84,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6695.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264752},{"amount":76.7,"local_amount":6873.58,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6929.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459410},{"amount":79.08,"local_amount":7294.94,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":7354.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.32,"payment_id":696587496},{"amount":83.57,"local_amount":7779.36,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7842.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.23,"payment_id":731022617}],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T03:21:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":806319,"name":"Juan Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan de 64 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene 5 hijos ya mayores y que le apoyan en sus gastos, su esposa es ama de casa. \u00c9l es agricultor y tiene mucha experiencia en el \u00e1rea, cultiva granos b\u00e1sicos principalmente ma\u00edz y frijol. \n\nSolicita el pr\u00e9stamo para cubrir los gastos para cosechar, esta pr\u00f3ximo el tiempo en que tiene que sacar su cultivo y prepararlo para guardarlo o venderlo.

She cooks the corn, yucca and potatoes, each separately, grinds it and acquires different types of dough which she fills with varying ingredients.  Preparation of the banana is different since it is not ground but sauteed in hot oil, then flattened and stuffed.  The finished products are typical foods of the Colombian Caribbean region and known as \"fritos\" (fried foods).  Each one has its own name: beef, chicken or cheese patties, sweet egg cakes, beef, chicken or mixed meet stuffed potatoes with hard boiled eggs, banana fritters and croquettes.\r\n\r\nLiliney bought the business from its previous owner who was badly in debt and sold the business in 2012.  Since then she has been obtaining satisfactory results.  Both her sales and purchases are conducted in cash, and she does her shopping in neighboring areas where she lives in Barranquilla.  She is requesting a CrediKiva loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to buy ingredients for her products such as eggs, wheat flour, potatoes, corn, oil, salt, sauces, knapkins and other items.  \r\n\r\nLiliney has three children and wants to continue educating them and giving them a better future.

She sells in the streets as many vendors do. With the loan she is requesting from you, she will stock up on such items and also winter clothing.

She can increase her profits if she takes on more orders of sari falls, blouses, petticoats, and dresses \u2013 garments favored by the local women who are her customers. To achieve this, she needs a better sewing machine and more materials. It will take her a long time to gather the capital needed to invest in these purchases, and local banks do not cater to borrowers like Mayaben. \r\n\r\nTo raise the microfinance she needs, under the guidance of the non-profit Prayas, Mayaben has formed a self-help group with Vanita, Laxmiben, Gitaben, and Valbai, also local women entrepreneurs with similar aspirations. Together, through Prayas\u2019 partner Milaap, they hope to crowdfund Rs. 100,000 to fund their small scale businesses. Like Mayaben, Vanita will invest in scaling up her tailoring microenterprise. Laxmiben sells cloth and garments; she will use the loan to boost her inventory of high-demand items like dresses, dress materials, scarves, curtains, and t-shirts. Gitaben runs what is locally known as a \u201ccutlery\u201d business, selling accessories like bangles, hair pins, rubber bands, etc. The loan will help her stock up on more such items and sell greater quantities. Valbai, who sells vegetables, will purchase eggplants, potatoes, tomatoes, and okra in bulk at better rates; these vegetables are in high demand locally and fetch better prices. \r\n\r\nThe investments these five women make using this loan will increase their incomes by over 50%. They will be able to re-invest in growing their businesses further, and will also increase their savings. Your timely loan will help put them in a position to guarantee that their children receive an education. They will repay your loan within 12 monthly installments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1726799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

She works hard to supplement her husband\u2019s income, and diligently saves, so they can be financially stable and have a guaranteed income source as they age. \r\n\r\nHowever, their savings of four thousand rupees a month (~$68) will not be sufficient to meet their needs in their old age, given the rising cost of living and healthcare.

She plans to buy greater quantities of betel leaves and seasonings at better rates; this will improve her profit margins and also help her cater to more customers, increasing her income. \r\n\r\nShe does not, however, possess the finances necessary to invest in this growth. Local banks do not provide microfinance to small rural entrepreneurs like Narmadaben, as she comes from a socio-economically backward family, and lacks the collateral for a loan. So Narmadaben formed a group with four other local women entrepreneurs in a similar situation. Deviben sells toys, and Kamlaben and Badliben sell vegetables \u2013 all three middle-aged women share the same goals as Narmadaben. The fourth member Hiraben runs a petty shop, and her goal is to save and send her two teen-aged children to college. Together, these women seek to crowdfund the Rs. 75,000 necessary to grow their businesses. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Deviben will be able to add new toys to her stock. Kamlaben and Badliben will buy vegetables that bring a higher profit, like tomatoes, okra, potatoes, bananas, and chilies. Hiraben will add utensils to the items she sells out of her small petty shop. These investments made using your loan will help increase their profits by an average of 50%.

She started her own tailoring microenterprise so she could provide her children a better education than the primary schooling she has had. She has two teenaged children, and supports her family of five with the income she earns by sewing clothes like dresses, shirts, and putting together falls and interlocks on saris. Her small business brings in Rs. 5700 a month (~$95), and she diligently saves most of this, running her home supported by the income her husband brings in. \r\n\r\nAware that these savings will be insufficient, she is working to increase her tailoring business\u2019s earning potential. To improve her productivity and take on more customers, she wants to buy a new and better sewing machine. She expects this will bring in extra business worth Rs. 8000 a month (~$130). \r\n\r\nTo put this plan into action, Bimlaben needs access to funds. Banks do not cater to rural small business owners like her. So, under the guidance of the non-profit Prayas and Milaap, she has formed a group with Shilpaben, Kakuben, Linaben, and Kaliben, who run petty shops and a provisional store respectively. With this loan, Shilpaben and Kakuben will add products like garlic, chips, and snacks to their inventory. Kaliben will start selling in her provisional store products like Vaseline, sugar, oil, ghee (clarified butter), and incense. These items have a higher unit cost and have a high consumption rate, which will boost their profits.\r\n\r\nTogether with her group, Bimlaben hopes to crowdfund the microfinance they need to develop their respective businesses. They seek a loan amounting to Rs. 35,000. Your loan will empower Bimlaben and her group to increase their incomes by up to 50%. \r\n\r\nBimlaben, like her group members, will use this significant boost in her savings to educate her children, invest in the further growth of her microenterprise, and repay your loan in 12 monthly installments."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":527.09,"image":{"id":1726812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

rural Surendranagar in Gujarat, India. Together with Sooltanben, Faridaben, Sushilaben, and Hasinaben, she seeks to crowdfund an enterprise loan of Rs. 100,000, which they plan to repay in 12 monthly installments. They need this microfinance to fund the small scale businesses that they run, so they can invest in serving more customers and increasing profits. \r\n\r\nJituben buys clothes in bulk and resells them at retail prices to local customers. The income and savings she currently makes are insufficient to fulfill her goals of achieving financial stability and improving the living standard for her family. So she will use her share of the enterprise loan to stock up on more popular items like dresses, jeans, stoles, saris, and leggings. Buying in bulk gets her better rates and also reduces the trips she has to make for sourcing her inventory. Saving on these business costs will improve her profit margins. With a larger inventory, she will cater to more customers and increase her revenue. \r\n\r\nAmong the other group members, Sooltanben and Faridaben also buy and resell clothes. They too will use the loan to stock up on the popular dresses, jeans, stoles, saris, and leggings. Sushilaben polishes diamonds, playing a role in the flourishing local diamond trade. She will use the loan to buy a special cutting machine, which will improve her productivity and income. Hasinaben is engaged in the local cottage industry of tie-dying, locally known as \u201cbandhani\u201d. She will use the loan to buy more cloth, so she can make and sell these fashionable, in-demand bandhani saris and dresses to more customers. \r\n\r\nThese investments will lead to a growth of around 50% in their incomes. Your loan will help empower this group of 5 women to grow their businesses and achieve their goals of securing financial stability and uplifting their families. With their savings, Sooltanben, Sushilaben, and Faridaben will also be able to guarantee enough savings so their children can access a good

His upbringing was challenging and he never went to college so that he could secure a formal job, but he did not surrender to that and has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. \r\n\r\nThrough farming, he has been able to take care of his family. His main source of income has been milk, eggs and crop farming, and through these ventures, he has supported his family because he is the only breadwinner. Paul passionately loves farming and has even nicknamed one of his animals \u201cBrown,\u201d which is an English word depicting the color of the cow. \r\n\r\nPaul stated that the most enjoyable bit about farming is \u201cit gives me personal fulfillment and feeds my family.\" Although he has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious man. He has been facing challenges transporting his produce from the farm to the market. That is why he is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. \r\n\r\nThe Nandihills area is a rural town and roads are very poor and transporting goods for Paul has always been a \u201cnightmare.\u201d He has been suffering losses because goods reach the market when they are not fresh, hence fetching a low price. Vegetables and milk are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and through the loan, he will be able to achieve his dream. \r\n\r\nHe plans to employ someone who will be helping him in farm work and transporting the produce to the market, hence affecting the society positively through creation of employment. Increased profits from the loan will allow him to repay the loan fully and permanently change his living conditions and assure his aging parents of a secure future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1751363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to transport goods to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.84,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.9,"local_amount":10211.95,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10291.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824454},{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":5058.93,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5098.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262648},{"amount":55.75,"local_amount":4998.23,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5036.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264756},{"amount":55.97,"local_amount":5018.43,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5057.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600970},{"amount":59.99,"local_amount":5378.09,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5419.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459414},{"amount":58.87,"local_amount":5396.24,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5438.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.32,"payment_id":681377832},{"amount":120.45,"local_amount":11449.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":11538.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.26,"payment_id":711505815},{"amount":187.8,"local_amount":17488.61,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":17624.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.26,"payment_id":731022621}],"funded_date":"2015-01-23T13:22:18Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":810868,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon is a 45-year-old married woman with seven children from Ormoc, Leyte.

He is 40 years of age and very passionate and diligent about farming. \r\n\r\nHe is considered to be a pacesetter when it comes to farming in his village of Koibarak in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Having done mixed farming for the past five years, he has gained a lot of experience, and he offers free extension services to young upcoming farmers. \r\n\r\nHe is happily married and is blessed with four lovely school-going children. \r\n\r\nPhilip enjoys generating income from selling milk, his harvest, and produce from his farm. He finds dairy farming very fulfilling, but the main challenge he faces is not being able to properly feed his dairy cows. He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan, he will be able to cut hay into small pieces before mixing it with other forage to feed his cattle.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I am in need of financial assistance in order to pay my tuition fee at AUCA because I have a low-income family. We have a big family of eight: my parents, my grandmother, my three sisters, my brother, and me. My parents don\u2019t have a permanent job, just under-working.  My grandmother is retired and gets a pension, which is the only stable income for our family. It is 98 dollars per month. My elder sister is a student at another university, so it became hard for my family to support two students at the same time. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my sister and I work as a housemaids in the summer. Of course, we can\u2019t save much money in 3 months, but it helps us to buy some school stuff and clothes. I understand that AUCA is too expensive a university for me, but now I live and breathe with AUCA.\r\n\r\nLast year I was fortunate in winning a donor\u2019s full scholarship to study at the New Generation Academy of AUCA. We got familiar with the AUCA teaching system and learnt languages, math, computer skills, etc. During that year I have so adapted to the AUCA family that I can\u2019t imagine myself out of it. I have a lot of friends from different countries who are also eager to learn something new every day.\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow me to study hard and focus just on my studies. Meanwhile, this scholarship will support me to do more community service and explore my potential in assisting the needs of my family.

suffering from poverty and malnutrition. Most of the people make their livelihood by working as laborers in the agricultural fields belonging to farmers in neighboring and more distant villages. \r\n\r\nMichael is a father of two who has been practicing farming on a small inherited piece of land for the past six years. To afford a decent and comfortable life for his children, he has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from his farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, he has been engaging in other small personal businesses. \r\n\r\nThe Nandihills area has a high demand for poultry products. Like many farmers from his region, Michael finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and he stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d His biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. \r\n\r\nHe lacks funds to increase his poultry farming, so he is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being from a marginalized community, he finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, he feels relieved knowing that his dream will be achieved, and he will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to his neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary man, he intends to accumulate more profits and expand his poultry business to other markets. This will increase his income and improve his living conditions. The extra income he will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan, permanently changing his living conditions, and securing the future of his school-going children.\r\n\r\nHelp this aspiring man achieve his dreams!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":294.13,"image":{"id":1751415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.22,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Post-disbursed"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":4854.17,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5111.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824457},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":4898.97,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5158.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264758},{"amount":56.47,"local_amount":4840.66,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5096.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459416},{"amount":58.17,"local_amount":5137.4,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5409.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.77,"payment_id":696587501},{"amount":61.49,"local_amount":5480.21,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5770.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.45,"payment_id":731022623}],"funded_date":"2015-01-22T11:31:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":810908,"name":"Savoeurng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Residing in Kampong Cham province, Savoeurng is 31 years old.

He has been practicing agricultural business for the past ten years and has never looked back. \r\n\r\nFor a living, Abraham sells milk and food products from his farm at the local market. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied. Although Abraham has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. \r\n\r\nAbraham is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Nandi Hills and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Abraham does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abraham is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat on the local market and other major markets in Kenya.

He is the fourth born in a family of seven. He is a proud emerging entrepreneur running his own mobile money transfer business. His business provides financial services to people in his community. He operates his business in Mazabuka, Zambia.\r\n\r\nLawrence used his first Kiva loan to start running his Zoona mobile money transfer business. The loan helped him to purchase a trading booth, which he uses to serve his customers\u2019 money sending needs. He also bought a mobile phone, which he uses to facilitate his transactions. Lawrence is now able to support his siblings. He sends half of his profits to help out with their needs; the other half is what he uses for his basic needs. This is not easy as he is not making much profit and he struggles to provide for everybody\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nLawrence is now applying for a second Kiva loan, which he plans to use to finance his business by adding to his working capital float. This is the money that he uses to serve customers on a daily basis. Currently Lawrence is operating his business with a minimum capital of $950 USD. This is not enough to serve customers who need to transact larger amounts of money. This loan will help Lawrence to fulfill some of his customers\u2019 transactions. This then helps to increase his commissions, which he depends on for his income. He is hopeful that this loan will help him grow his business, as he will be able to serve more customers. Lawrence currently works alone at his trading booth.  He hopes to employ youth from his community as his business grows.\r\n\r\nLawrence\u2019s dream is to become a successful businessman and reach out to more rural areas where people do not have access to banking services. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1646582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"To provide essential transaction cash needed for him to grow his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Mazabuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T15:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T15:30:15Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T00:31:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":807481,"name":"God's Grace School","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Uganda!

Agriculture in Kenya continues to dominate Kenya\u2019s economy, and is also the largest contributor to Kenya\u2019s gross domestic product. Philip, 34, started farming approximately six years ago, and although he began farming as a hobby, it eventually became his career. His half-acre of land located in the Nandihills area of Kenya houses poultry and dairy cows. Philip passionately loves poultry farming. The Nandihills area is populated, and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Philip' biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. Poultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and you don\u2019t need to be a large scale farmer to benefit from it. Through the loan, Philip will be able to sell eggs, meat, and poultry feathers to the already existing market. The demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in his area. Philip has been facing challenges accessing finances, but he feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Philip chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loans is low, and is on a reducing basis. Philip underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Through the loan, Philip's income will increase and his life will permanently change, leading to better living conditions for his family and a positive impact to the

She hopes that she can earn more income to upgrade her lifestyle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1751431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more pork to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Prey Chhor district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T15:40:06Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokhorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mao","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tara","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":227000},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":203000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-21T10:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595344425},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-24T10:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611977203},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T11:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624988131},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T14:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636489381},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649756571},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665245796},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T17:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681552511},{"amount":56.75,"local_amount":227000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T17:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":231369.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696757908},{"amount":221,"local_amount":884000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":901017,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711690879}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T21:02:50Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T19:21:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":810921,"name":"Selina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selina is 24 years old. She is friendly and hardworking. She operates a Zoona mobile money-transfer business, providing financial services to people in her mining town of Chingola. \r\n\r\nSelina has been running her business for four months now. She started running her own business after accessing a loan from Kiva. The loan helped her with her setup costs. She was able to purchase a small trading booth, which she now uses to serve customers. She also bought a mobile phone, which she uses to make her transactions. Selina is very grateful, she says without the loan from Kiva she would not have been able to start running her own business because she did not have enough cash to purchase a trading booth and a phone.\r\n\r\nSelina takes pride in her Zoona business and strives to create an atmosphere that is welcoming to her customers and keeps them coming back. She enjoys the responsibility of running a successful small business. Selina\u2019s challenge is that she operates her business with a minimum capital of $1000. This is not enough to service customers who want to transact larger amounts of money. This saddens her because she then loses out on profits. She has requested a Kiva loan to help her grow her business by increasing the funds that she uses to transact with her customers. This will help Selina earn more profits. \r\n\r\nSelina\u2019s biggest dream is to go to college and study Business Administration. She is hopeful that once her business grows and becomes profitable, she can go back to school.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1653122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"To grow her business by increasing the funds that she uses to transact with her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T15:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T15:40:07Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-11T19:58:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Lennon","image":1707241}},{"id":811549,"name":"Sheryigit","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":" \u0428\u0435\u0440\u0439\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0442  \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f 1968 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0432 \u043a\u0438\u0448\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0435  \u041d\u0438\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0418\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d \u0421\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043b \u0441\u0430\u043c. \u041e\u043d \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0438  \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0414\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434  \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043e\u043c-\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c.\n\u0412 \u0434\u0435\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u00ab\u0421\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0438\u043b\u043e\u00bb \u043e\u043d \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 2,0 \u0433\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438,  \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 0,5 \u0433\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 1,0 \u0433\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 , 0,5 \u0433\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b.\n \u041e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.\n\u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443 \u041c\u0414\u041e \u0410\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0434.\n","en":"Sheryigit was born in 1968 to a family of carpenters in Nidjani village, near the city Istaravshan in the Sogdiisky region.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. If Kamwana 3 community had a way to treat their water, they could improve the health of their community, keeping children at school and parents at work.\n\nThis is why Bonking is requesting a loan for a chlorine dispenser on behalf of his community.

He is not only representing his community on Kiva, but also volunteers his time to educate the people in  Kamwana 3 village on the importance of safe water, and how to use the chlorine dispenser when they come to fetch water at their local water point. There are also 4 other volunteer promoters from this community, namely: Peter, Mary, Paul, and Pamela who are also part of this loan. The loan will be used for the installation of the dispensers and the initial supplies of chlorine. Bonking wants to be a promoter because he believes that the chlorine will help his community to consume safe water.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits.

He owns a Zoona mobile money transfers shop in Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. He comes from a family of six and has a three-year-old son. Caesar describes his business as the service of sending and receiving money. He is very proud of the fact that he has been able to start his business from scratch. \r\n\r\nBefore Caesar started his own business, he was an apprentice at a legal firm performing duties of a legal clerk. This gave Caesar confidence in himself and helped him to push through with his dream of opening his own business.  He enjoys running his business because he sees the impact it has on the community. People do not have to use their transport money to go into the central business area to access financial services. He also likes that it is a decent way to earn a living.\r\n\r\nCaesar is requesting a Kiva loan to purchase the small trading booth that he currently uses to operate his business. The trading booth costs 1,000 USD and he will use the rest of the money from this loan to increase his float (the working capital that he uses to serve his customers).

Benjamin has seen his business grow very steadily and is very happy with the progress. This will be his third loan from Kiva. His first loan helped him serve more customers by increasing his capital and he successfully repaid this loan. Benjamin then suffered a misfortune when his shop caught fire. He got a second loan to help him rebuild his business after the loss. This loan helped him get back on his feet and he was able to serve his customers and has since repaid this loan. Benjamin thanks Kiva lenders for their help. \r\n\r\nBenjamin has some day-to-day challenges that he encounters. He sometimes lacks adequate float (the working capital that he uses to serve his customers) to sustain huge money transfer transactions. Benjamin then has to turn customers away, which results in fewer commissions being earned. He has also wanted to grow his business by opening up more outlets within the region, but due to lack of capital, this has not been done. \r\n\r\nBenjamin is requesting a loan to open up another outlet to reach out to distant communities and increase his daily float to facilitate bigger payments. His loan will increase his revenue and help support his family financially.

She is 28 years old. She lives in the J. Rumy district. This district was recently renamed after the great Persian writer, Jalohiddini Rumy. Mayya is married. She wants to start her own, stable business. Mayya decided to start an animal husbandry business because Tajikistan's climate is quite suitable for this type of business and favorably contributes to the healthy livestock growth.

She has received and paid back 3 large loans, which helped her open more outlets and employ more young people from her community. Having access to the Kiva loans has also given Angela an adequate float of working capital in order to service her customers efficiently.

She is passionate about empowering young women to keep them from vices like prostitution, which is rife in the mining town of Solwezi.\r\n\r\nNow that Angela has successfully paid back her three previous loans, she is requesting a new loan to continue growing her mobile money business. With this loan, she will be able to serve more customers in a community that needs financial services.

He has been practicing agricultural business for the past nine years and has never looked back. For a living, David sells milk and food products from his farm at the local market. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied. \r\n\r\nAlthough David has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. David is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Nandi Hills and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. \r\n\r\nDavid does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. With this loan, David is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, David will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm. Through this loan, he will assure his large family of a secure future and improved living conditions.\r\n\r\nDavid dreams of having a sustainable poultry business in the future with a good flow of customers, and of generating work.

I applied to AUCA and learned about the Kiva loan, which surprised me, and I understood that it is my fortune.\r\n\r\nMy English teacher, Valeria, was my inspiration at school. She is an alumna of AUCA and wanted us to enter it. She used to tell us that AUCA offers a dual degree with Bard College, [and] opens doors for talented students from around the world with the passion to learn and transform the world. I loved to take her classes and my life changed 100%. She taught us not only the grammar and punctuation of English, but we used to discuss the difficult topics like DNA, international terrorism, education in Europe and America, global population increasing and so on. \r\n\r\nThanks to her classes I have improved my English. I even participated in English Olympiads and took good places, what assured me [to] never give up my dream: AUCA. \r\n\r\nI studied hard and successfully passed AUCA entrance exams. My mother was glad for my achievements, but worried about my tuition fee. As we are three people in my family- my mother, my sister and me - my mother is the only breadwinner in it. She worked full years without vacations, just to support us and give a good education. Unfortunately, several months ago she lost her job, which made my family\u2019s financial situation worse. \r\n\r\nI hope Kiva lenders will review my situation and will give me a chance to be the best student of AUCA.\""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1751527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

years old, a widow and a mother of 3 children. all of whom are grown and independent. Gulbara has a secondary education and has been involved in animal husbandry for 14 years. Having started with 10,000 som (KGS), today, thanks to her hard work, Gulbara has 4 cows and 18 sheep. Her monthly income amounts up to 15,000 som (KGS), but this money is not enough for a decent life and supporting a family. Because the animal husbandry business provides the sole source of income for Gulbara's family, she requested a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy 2 dairy cows with calves in order to further develop her business. Gulbara plans to invest the earnings from the loan into increasing her livestock headcount and saving money for her son's

He was doing only half an acre of maize crop per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for survival. Eliud kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2011, when he switched to tomato farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for him. \r\n\r\nToday, Eliud is a full-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. He has already fully serviced other asset-based loans from Juhudi Kilimo! Through the loans, he has acquired high quality dairy cows, irrigation kits and poultry.\r\n\r\nTo capitalize more on returns from the booming tomato farming, Eliud is seeking a loan of KES 70,000 to build a greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Eliud conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. \r\n\r\nYour lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Eliud\u2019s goal, which is to expand the greenhouse.

Joseah is arguably among the most successful clients of Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. \r\n\r\nAgriculture is his family's occupation and also the primary source of income for his family. Joseah owns half an acre of land in the village and cultivates tea and maize. He has always been proud to call himself a farmer and, now, he is even more proud to call himself a dairy farmer. \r\n\r\nJoseah is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge he has of farming, he commands a lot of respect from other farmers in his village. Dairy farming is close to his heart and, every day, he wakes up to milk his cow and that makes him very proud. \r\n\r\nAlthough he makes profits through selling milk, Joseah lacks a proper dairy unit and he is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan, he will have an easier time milking his cow and also feeding it. \r\n\r\nA good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Joseah believes that, through this loan, his living conditions will change because he is going to have an increase in milk production. He will save money that he used to spend on treating his cows because he lacked a good dairy unit.\r\n\r\nJoseah's only objective is to progress and care for his family, which is what lifts his fighting and vigorous spirit.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1751560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":811012,"name":"Harriet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harriet lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Sebastian is seeking a KES 10,000 loan to purchase farm implements. These tools will make the work on his farm move much faster and easier. Tending to his tree nursery involves a lot of digging, uprooting, planting and packaging. There are various tools in the market that are handy for a man in his line of work.

Like other Babban Gona members, Abdulmunmuni is looking to earn a better income to provide more food and clothing for his family, and he hopes to become the most profitable farmer in his community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1639495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn at low prices after harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T18:10:06Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdulmunmuni ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":16915,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":16915}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-12T18:44:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}}]}
