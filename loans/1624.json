She is married and has three children, ages 12, 25 and 30. Her business is selling traditional food. She is a good mother, honest, generous, understanding, patient, responsible and hardworking. She has her business in the area of  \u2018villa el Carmen, an area characterized by the bus station with buses going North of the region. The weather is cold and dry, with temperatures of 8-16 degrees Celsius during the whole year. Simona is dark skinned, short, and has long black braided hair. She wears traditional dress (hat, shawl and skirt). Her native language is Aymara, and she speaks Spanish for commerce. She spends her life together with her 3 children, who are independent. She is separated from her husband. They live in a rented house that has drinking water and electricity. Her business is selling traditional food such as: plato pace\u00f1o (dish from La Paz), made of corn, cheese, lima beans and potatoes; aji de papa lisa (potatoes, rice and chili, aji); Anticucho (grilled beef heart); Chairo (dry potato soup); fricase (spicy pork soup), and others. She started her business by observing that in her neighborhood there was no place to eat. She saw that they were building a bus terminal, and this is how she started her business. Little by little her food was running out and each day she needed to prepare more. \"My set customers like how I cook and the food ran out quickly because I do not have a place to store the food\", she comments. Her dream is to broaden and diversify her business in order to satisfy her customers better. She wants to invest in her business by buying a freezer in order to have fresh food ingredients to prepare the daily food. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in 10 years that she has been working in this job. These are the reasons why Simona is requesting a loan in order to buy a freezer to have fresh ingredients to cook in larger amounts.

","en":"This elderly resident of the Dangara region is called Ozoda. She is 59 years old and the mother of three children. Her sons are 32 and 26 years old, and her daughter is 24. Ozoda's husband is already retired, and her sons have gone to Russia as migrant workers. \r\n\r\nOzada is engaged in a popular activity - sewing. 10 years ago, she started her sewing business, which she continues tirelessly to this day. Ozoda takes orders for sewing women's national dresses.

loan from Friendship Bridge, last April, which was funded by KIVA lenders. They report that the loan was of great benefit to them in sustaining and expanding their small businesses. They are requesting a new loan, to continue the trend.<br \/><br \/>The President of the Trust Bank is Abida, who is 35 years old and has a track record of effective leadership. She married when she was only 17 years old and has four children, three of whom are enrolled in school.  Abida has two businesses, textile production and the sale of chicken. She is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase more chickens to fatten up, as well as the materials she needs to create more traditional textiles. She is determined to increase sales and generate more income.<br \/><br \/>Abida and her friends in the Trust Bank benefit from the educational component of the Friendship Bridge \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program. Each month at their Trust Bank meetings, a Loan Officer from the organization shares practical information with the ladies, often in their own indigenous language. Subjects covered include business management practices including accounting, marketing, budgeting, and customer service.

Her business is selling clothing and cosmetics. She is enterprising, independent, consistent, responsible, and hardworking good mother. She does her business in the \u201cPlan 3000\u201d zone, an area characterized by a flood that razed everything in its path 31 years ago. The flood was the reason for creating a citadel which is the economic epicenter of the city. People from the Ayoreas ethnicity and miners from the west relocated and mix in this multicultural and multiethnic environment. The area is tropical and humid with an ambient temperature of around 30 degrees Celsius throughout the year.\n\nMassie is of dark complexion. She is tall, has long black hair, and her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed. She also speaks Spanish. She wears the black blouse. Her life has given her two children. The oldest studies in school and the youngest is in her care. They live in a rented house with electricity and water. The need to provide for her family led her to begin this banking group of entrepreneurs who sell soft drinks, books, fruit, tomatoes, clothing, fish, and provide construction services. They borrow to prosper in their businesses. \n\nHer business is selling clothing and cosmetics at a fixed stall that she has in the market. The clothing range is seasonal with pants, sweatshirts, blouses, shirts, and more. She sells cosmetics brands like Yanbal, L\u2019Oreal, Avon, and more. She has some on display and sells others by catalog. She wants to buy wholesale merchandise for her business to prepare for this year\u2019s holidays. This is their first sequence of loans from the institution in her 20 years of doing this work. \n\nIt is for these reasons that Massiel is requesting a loan to purchase wholesale clothing and cosmetics to be ready for the yearend sales.

Her business is located in the \"Villa Fatima\" zone, a place characterized by informal trade and by public transportation that reaches the northern populations of the city. The climate there is cold with winds from the mountains that are 3600 meters (11,800 feet) above sea level. \n\nLilian is of dark complexion with dark eyes, long dark hair, average height with a robust physique. Her mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1 which she uses rarely. She uses Spanish for business. She shares her life with her three children; the two eldest ones are in school and she cares for the youngest one. \n\nLilian works at making sheets, comforters, bedspreads, pillow cases, etc. to sell at wholesale. She does this work at home with her family. Her customers order at wholesale and then resell the items at retail and they contribute ideas such as types of fabrics, themes for children's day, Christmas and other seasons, etc. \"I have been doing this work since I was young. In the beginning I made women's clothing until I found my market niche (sheets) and I ran with it...\" she states. \n\nHer dream is to open a store where she can sell her products. She wants to buy fabrics at wholesale so she can satisfy her year-end orders. This is her second loan cycle with the institution in the six years that she has been doing this work. This is why she is asking for a loan - to buy fabric at wholesale so she can satisfy her year-end orders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1735395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric at wholesale so she can satisfy her year-end orders for sheets and comforters.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T22:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T22:10:16Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":427.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":466.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":513.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":519.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":563.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":566.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":597.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":603.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":659.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":673.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":700.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":708.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.59},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.43},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":130.93,"local_amount":894.17,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":904.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157387},{"amount":894.07,"local_amount":6105.83,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6177.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554287}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T03:27:31Z","paid_date":"2015-02-17T11:40:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"marcia margolis","image":null}},{"id":811164,"name":"Aisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aisha lives in Kampala, Uganda.

It is one of just a few towns in the country with absolutely no illiteracy. The population is very enthusiastic and hard-working and strives to move ahead in their lives.\nSeven women have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cTriunfadoras Visitecas\u201d meaning \u201cThe Victorious Women of Visitecas\u201d. They strive to create a higher standard of living and a more prosperous future for their children and the community at large. The women have requested a loan from Friendship Bridge and are hopeful that it will be funded by KIVA investors.\nThe President of the Trust Bank is Do\u00f1a Alida who studied to be a teacher. She is 42 years of age with two children. One of her children is in elementary school and the other, who is a teenager, is attending middle school. Do\u00f1a Alida is thrilled about this and highly motivated to create additional income so that her children can study in a university in the future. She understands the importance of formal education. Last year, Do\u00f1a Alida opened a business selling delicious fruit sorbets. She is requesting a loan to buy fruit, flavoriings and supplies to improve the quality of her iced treats. Do\u00f1a Alida also raises chickens and will use some of her funds to buy feed for them.\nDuring their monthly meetings, the ladies in the \u201cTriunfadoras Visitecas\u201d Trust Bank learn that they do have a voice, through games, drawings and role playing; the women learn how to more effectively care for their children with new information about nutrition, health and hygiene. They gather information about effective business practices like formulating effective business plans, budgeting, accounting, marketing and customer service. They feel more empowered and informed and this greatly raises their self-esteem. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. Quite simply, it works.\nIt is nearly impossible for an impoverished woman to secure a loan in a banking institution. In funding these loans, KIVA investors, partnering with Friendship Bridge, provide a most valuable opportunity to these women. Thank you, KIVA investors!\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":1734938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for the fruit sorbet she sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Maria Visitacion, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arelys Zulema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Gertrudis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2015-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2015-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3524.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595161402},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1762.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610557926},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1762.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231066},{"amount":330.36,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2517.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636216796},{"amount":297.32,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649566997},{"amount":148.66,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665049153},{"amount":148.66,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681347012}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T11:37:26Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T13:46:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":811197,"name":"Rose's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose, pictured above, has been a farmer for 14 years, and is now proud to represent her group of 10 farmers in Kakamega South District.

Highlands of Guatemala. Eight K\u2019iche Maya ladies, who live in this village, have formed The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Margaritas de Barranche.\u201d \n\nOne of the youngest members of the group is Patricia, who is less than 20 years old and only has five years of education. She was forced to abandon her education due to the poverty of her family. A couple of years ago, Patricia began her own family and now has two children. Her children are the motivation for her daily hard work. In order to earn income to sustain her family, she and her husband sell jackets (ponchos) and dusters. On a daily basis, her husband sells their goods walking about the village, while Patricia sells on market days in the plaza of a nearby village. This husband and wife team work hard in order to create beneficial conditions where their children can be healthy and get an education. Patricia is requesting a new loan in order to purchase merchandise to increase sales of jackets (ponchos) and dusters. \n\nThe ladies of the \u201cMargaritas de Barranche\u201d Trust Bank participate in educational sessions at their monthly meetings.

She started out as a beautician and later started incorporating sales of various products (personal care products, cosmetics and foodstuffs), taking advantage of the captive audience she has built up.  Her current goal is to increase her number of clients and expand the infrastructure of her salon, though her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital to achieve her goal in a timely way.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which will be the first time she finances with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy supplies for her salon and assorted merchandise.  With this investment, her business will improve as she will expand what she offers to the public and she will buy in cash to get discounts applied to the prices.  This will benefit her clients, which will mean her Kiva loan is a success.

As the head of the family, Suwarno realizes he needs extra income to save for his children\u2019s education.  \r\n\r\nAbout one and a half years ago, Suwarno met a Ruma field staff that made him decide to start a business of selling mobile phone airtime credits and serving utility bill payments to his surrounding community. Suwarno now has become a successful agent, since his customers are people in peri-urban areas who are in need of access to such services. \r\n\r\nAs the business runs, Suwarno hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile airtime and bill payment transactions, especially on the weekends. In the near future, Suwarno plans to add more products from Ruma to the things he serves, such as e-commerce for low-income communities.

He is independent, a good father, patient, entrepreneurial, responsible and hard-working.  He has his business in the south of the city, a place where once per year thousands of people come to sell their arts and crafts in a fair called \"la Alasita\" where all types of different miniature goods are offered with the idea that the miniature good materializes and becomes a reality (the belief is that you buy dreams so that they can become a reality, for example; a miniature car materializes one year later to become a real car).  The area has a warm tropical climate with a constant 30 degrees Celsius temperature throughout the whole year.\r\n\r\nBenjamin is of dark complexion, has short black hair, is quite short, his mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed but he also speaks Spanish due to the culture and for his business. He shares his live with his partner who makes a living selling empanadas and also lives with his son who will be starting school soon.\r\n\r\nHe has his own business fixing and painting automobiles.  He mainly does auto body repair for cars which have been damaged due to accidents or impacts which have caused both esthetical or structural damage.  In order to do his work he must first clean the area of the car with soap and water.  Then he must sand the area which needs to be painted with a disc sander to about 12.5 centimeters on both sides of the damaged area.  Finally, he applies 3 coats of newspaper to the damaged area to then spray the sanded area with 5 coats of automotive paint.

Her husband drives the tricycle that carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines especially in the provinces like Palawan, tricycle is a common means of transportation.

Homa Bay County is located in south-western Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity of the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflowers, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts (peanuts) and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although bee-keeping has not traditionally been practised in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits.\r\n\r\nMoses is married and has 13 children. He runs a small business selling fish and also does farming with his wife. They have now been farming for 10 years and are currently growing maize, sorghum, beans, groundnuts and sunflowers. Moses is excited about bee-keeping as it will earn him some income from the sale of honey and provide him with honey for food and medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is Moses' first loan with Honey Care and he plans to use the proceeds from his beehives to invest in his business and pay his children's school fees.

He is happily married and, together with his beautiful wife, he is blessed with two children. \n\nFor the past 10 years, he has been involved in mixed farming and because of the immense knowledge he has in farming, farmers from his village and neighboring villages come to his home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, tea, and some personal businesses he engages in to make extra income. \n\nHillary sells cereals to his neighbors and to the local market and makes additional money. Although his work is not without challenges, he says, he is regarded as the best cereal seller in his village. \n\nHe has been unable to meet the market demand which has resulted in a loss of tenders. One of his neighbors ordered 100 bags of maize that he was unable to supply. He is seeking a loan to buy more cereals so that he can satisfy the demand. He intends to buy different variety of cereals such as millet, rice, sorghum and maize. \n\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that supports small-scale farmers, Hillary is confident that this loan will permanently change his life. Increased profits from cereal selling will allow him to afford his highest monthly expenses; to pay for farm-related comforts and the ability to channel a surplus amount to his children's education.

He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience, despite personal challenges, and his passion to support his two children as a primary caregiver. \r\n\r\nThe living conditions in the Eldoret area are very tough, and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Hillary has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Hillary started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past ten years. Hillary's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that he faces, is delivering to the market on time. \r\n\r\nThe Eldoret area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Hillary is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. \r\n\r\nHillary is very determined to succeed and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans that through accumulated profits, he will be able to provide a secure future for himself and also for his children. \r\n\r\nHillary's dream is to provide a secure future for his children through paying tuition fees for them. Through your loan, you will help him realize his dream."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1744854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-09T23:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-23T23:50:09Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":806457,"name":"Jose Filadelfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y no tiene hijos, estudi\u00f3 hasta 6\u00b0 grado de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica y dejo sus estudios por no tener la capacidad econ\u00f3mica para pagarlos.

fibras para lavar y entregar sus pedidos a tiempo. Otras personas tambi\u00e9n compran las piezas elaboradas y salen a revenderlas a otras comunidades. Actualmente ya existen m\u00e1s tiendas encargadas de distribuir los art\u00edculos de jarcer\u00eda, lo que beneficia a los peque\u00f1os comerciantes de la localidad.\n\nDo\u00f1a Gregoria es una mujer muy trabajadora, tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad y es viuda, tuvo 6 hijos que ya son independientes, aunque uno de sus nietos vive en su casa y es ella quien solventa los gastos de su educaci\u00f3n preparatoria.\n\nPor m\u00e1s de 32 a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a atender su tienda de abarrotes, platica que la inici\u00f3 porque su casa estaba muy cerca de una escuela primaria, \u201cmis hijos en ese entonces eran muy peque\u00f1os, todos se encontraban estudiando y con el sueldo de mi esposo no alcazaba para solventar todos los gastos\". As\u00ed que el negocio represent\u00f3 una buena alternativa porque no hab\u00eda ning\u00fan tipo de competencia entonces y las ventas eran muy buenas. En un principio Gregoria vend\u00eda \u00fanicamente l\u00e1pices, libretas y dulces para los estudiantes.

Con base en mucho esfuerzo y con sus ganancias construy\u00f3 un local donde ahora cabe mejor la mercanc\u00eda que ofrece. Gregoria se siente muy orgullosa porque gracias a su negocio pudo dar estudios a sus hijos y tiene la oportunidad de apoyar a su nieto.

","en":"In a community of the state of Mexico, a large percentage of the population is involved in the business of buying and selling household and cleaning products. In the past there was only one store where people could fill their orders on time and obtain the metal mesh used to create scrubbing fibers. Other people also purchase prefabricated pieces and go out to resell them in other areas. Nowadays there are more stores which distribute household and cleaning products, which benefits the salespeople in the community.\r\n\r\nGregoria is a very hardworking woman. She is 58 years old and is a widow. She has six children who now live independently, though one of her grandchildren lives with her and Gregoria is responsible for paying for his education. \r\n\r\nShe has owned her grocery store for over 32 years. She says that she started this business because her house was very close to a primary school. She says \"my children were very young, all of them were in school and we couldn't cover all of our expenses on my husband's salary alone\". The business offered a good alternative option because she didn't need any kind of special qualifications to run it, and she had very good sales. In the beginning Gregoria only sold pencils, books and sweets for the students. Then, bit-by-bit, she began integrating new products such as sodas and a few grocery items. Through a lot of effort, she built a store, which now houses all of her merchandise better.\r\n\r\nGregoria currently needs to purchase additional merchandise such as milk, eggs, bread, sugar and sweets to restock her store.\r\n\r\nAlthough more stores have opened up in the community over time, this does not worry Gregoria. Not even the woman who sells sweets just outside of her store worries Gregoria. She says \"I think that the sun comes out for everybody, and we all have the right to pursue our own wellbeing\". Her only priority is to ensure that her grandson is able to become a professional.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are Moises and Filiberta, who use their loans to purchase cleaning supply products; Aurora with her grocery store; Lilia and Angel who are metalworkers; Ofelia who raises sheep; and David who has a taxi.\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years, Gregoria and her fellow group members have requested a loan from VisionFund to invest in their businesses. They are very grateful to the support they have received because their businesses have evolved.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Gregoria is wearing a purple sweater."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6600,"image":{"id":1744980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase merchandise such as milk, eggs, bread, sugar and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Emilio Portes Gil, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-10T03:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-24T03:50:04Z","loan_amount":6600,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":58.43,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moises","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filiberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":11250},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2475,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":33857.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349929},{"amount":1650,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":22571.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980643},{"amount":1603.08,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":22571.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":46.92,"payment_id":624423796},{"amount":813.49,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11285.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.51,"payment_id":636769129}],"funded_date":"2014-12-10T19:16:17Z","paid_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kati Mayfield","image":470169}},{"id":811302,"name":"Hala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hala is a 28-year-old married woman from Yatta, a village near Hebron city.

Her husband earns a living by farming.\r\n\r\nJocelyn requested a loan for 20,000 PHP, which she will use to buy additional stocks such as soap, beverages, canned goods, and soft drinks. With the improved stock she will be able to attract more consumers to shop and purchase, resulting in a higher income. Jocelyn hopes she can manage her current business so she can support the needs of her growing

To earn some extra money for her family, Erkingul has farmed crops and livestock for the past 30 years, and currently has one cow, one bull calf and eight sheep on her farm as well as 8.0 hectares of land for growing barley as a cash crop.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, her business brings in around 12,000 som per month, which is fundamental in paying for her family's food and other daily necessities.  To further develop her business, Erkingul has requested a loan of 150,000 som from Bai Tushum Bank to buy two dairy cows and bull calves each.
