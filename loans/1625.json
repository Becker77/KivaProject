He is married and has five children, ages 50, 48, 46, 44 and 40 years old respectively. All of Abraham's children are independent adults with their own homes. Abraham has only a first grade education as his family did not have enough money to pay for his studies. Abraham's wife is a housewife; the couple has one grandchild living with them.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age, Abraham learned to make rooftiles, bricks and adobe bricks and he now has 45 years experience in this work. Abraham decided to work in this trade as he earns very good profits, and because it is a family business. Abraham works at home and supports one son and one grandson with this work.

married, and the mother of three children. She has a high school education and earns supplemental income for her family through raising livestock and planting crops, which she started five years ago. Thanks to her dedication and hard work, she currently has two cows, as well as 0.4 hectares of shared land and 5.0 hectares of rented land, where she grows rice.

It began with displaying a small amount of viands to their neighbors until she opened a small space for the eatery. To generate more income, Gloria joined Paglaum Cooperative, which helped her in the capitalization of her sari-sari (small grocery) store in March of 2012. She became a MIGS member, which is why she has received loans several times already. Now, she has applied for a 20,000 PHP loan to buy merchandise for her sari-sari store and to pay for additional raw ingredients for her eatery business.

My dreams are to find my own place in society, to have my own happy family, to be a successful businessman.  As I am the only son and future supporter of my parents, I want to be a responsible,  smart and  well-educated person.\r\n\r\nMy family lives in Tokmok, a small town in the Chuy region of Kyrgyzstan.  My parents decided to live there because it was costly to raise two children in Bishkek.  My parents are vendors at the market, so they are effected by the retail season, the shipment of goods, frequent closures of the borders with neighboring countries and so on.  You never know how much you will earn in any month or year.  My sister is a student at another university.  She studies Korean language. \r\n\r\nI value every dollar my parents invested in me and I appreciate their hard work to make our life comfortable, but I can\u2019t give up my study at AUCA.  I have no doubts that AUCA will help me reach my future goals, as I imagine it, with honesty and integrity.  Critical thinking and academic freedom are what I love most about AUCA.\r\n\r\nIt is for the above mentioned reasons that I am asking for a loan to pay for my tuition fees so that I can graduate from the university.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1749670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He is a hard-working man and is honest and faithful to what he does and what he says. Cyrus is interested in many farming activities. Currently, he is doing dairy farming, maize farming, and horticulture. He has spent the last 10 years in agriculture and loves it. His main sources of income are milk and maize. He makes extra money on the side through a boda boda (motorcycle) business. He is very appreciative of the fact that farming has earned sustainable returns. This enables him to enjoy profits and expand. Cyrus is seeking a loan to purchase a chaff cutter, which is a mechanical device that he will use in cutting straw or hay into small pieces before being mixed together with other forage to feed his cows. Cyrus has been having problems feeding his cows and most of the time his cows refuse to eat but through this loan, the chaff cutter will aid the animal's digestion and prevent the cows from rejecting any part of the food. Through proper feeding, his cows will produce more milk and hence increase his income. Cyrus believes the key to increased milk production is proper health.

agricultural institute, but she is an accomplished farmer from Kapsowar area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. She is happily married and, together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with one child. \n\nFor the past five years Caroline has been involved in dairy farming. And because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. Caroline has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality breed of sheep. Sheep farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and wool prices in the recent past have been going up, so Caroline, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of sheep that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get wool and meat from the sheep but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her wool and meat will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big wool processing firms. \n\nCaroline said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agricultural based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going child."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1748175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-10T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-24T18:30:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.39,"local_amount":4479.27,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4562.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824403},{"amount":60.57,"local_amount":5383.76,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5484.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600958},{"amount":64.76,"local_amount":5912.23,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6022.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.75,"payment_id":696587480},{"amount":46.17,"local_amount":4224.74,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4303.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.36,"payment_id":752110830}],"funded_date":"2014-12-10T20:39:50Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:23:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":811926,"name":"Ndeye Kadiatou's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le banc villageois est cr\u00e9\u00e9 en juin 2009.

This investment will be recovered in the short term because his sales are generated on a cash basis, benefiting cash flow and reinvestment in the purchase of drinks. \r\n\r\nHermes has a goal of getting married and form a family, and for his business his long-term plan is to build a second floor to increase the business\u2019s capacity. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1745890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"purchase a cooler with the capacity to hold 1000 bottles, and make adjustments to his business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2014-12-10T19:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-24T19:10:01Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermes Dario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72190},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":118356},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":121906},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125564},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":129330},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133210},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137207},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":141323},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145563},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":149929},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":154427},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":159060},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":163832},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":168747},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":173809},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":179024},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":184394},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":189926},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":195624},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":201493},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":207537},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":213764},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":220176},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":313609}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.05},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.39},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.28},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.48},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.19},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.99},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.87},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Luisa Islas","image":null}},{"id":809784,"name":"Okari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Okari had no savings, pension or income with which to support his five children, siblings and elderly mother after dropping out of school because of a lack of tuition fees and facing a lack of employment. \r\n\r\nSeeing little future in their impoverished village in the Nyanza area of Kenya, he and his wife Lucy moved their family to the more prosperous town of Kitale, hoping to make a go of farming and create a better life for their family. \r\n\r\nIn Kitale, Okari decided that he would be independent and contribute to his community by starting poultry farming.

Some time back, Okari joined the Ekebara self-help group, composed of mostly marginalized farmers who could not secure loans from formal financial institutions. The group secured loans from Juhudi Kilimo through a group-based guarantee mechanism. \r\n\r\nAfter being successfully registered into the company, group members went through training on basic financial and business skills. Group members are a source of encouragement and empowerment for each other.\r\n\r\nOkari has applied for a loan of 180,000 Kenyan shillings to purchase more poultry.

Meet Phylis, a mother of four from Koibarak, a rural village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. Phylis has been involved in farming for 10 years! Her primary income sources are milk, maize, eggs and other personal businesses she engages in to make ends meet. \n\nFrom her experience, dairy farming is not only profitable but also enjoyable: all the animals on her farm are referred to by names.

Introducing you to Robert. Robert is a 35-year-old honest, hard-working and ever-smiling father of four adorable children. He hails from Litein in Kenya, a tea-growing area where the staple food is \u201cMursik,\u201d a mouth-watering delicacy prepared from milk. Robert has been involved in farming for the past 15 years and he owns dairy cows that produce milk for sale. Besides his dairy cows, he also keeps poultry and when you visit his farm you will witness tea growing as well as a variety of vegetables. Robert has a passion for dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of his cows \u201cSeroy\u201d (from a person's name); but all is not well for this humble man. He is facing the challenge of the lack of a proper dairy unit which is why he is seeking funds to construct a proper dairy unit. With your loan, he will be able to better manage his dairy farm and create more value. A better dairy unit will assist Robert to save more money because his cows will never be sick and this will also boost his dairy's milk production. Through building a dairy unit with the loan, Robert will be able to collect the cows' by-products, namely, cow dung and urine which can be sold or better yet used on his farm. With a dairy unit, he will be able to better feed his animals and collect by-products such as dung to generate biogas fuel, make organic fertilizer and plaster his mud hut. The money that he will earn from the dairy unit will be reinvested back into the business to create growth.

She is 42 years old and has been married for 23 years to Gregorio, who works in home construction.  Together they formed a family with 6 children, 3 of whom still depend on them.<br \/><br \/>Nine years ago, Hilaria heard about VisionFund and decided to apply for her first loan to raise and fatten lambs.  But in reality, she already has 20 years of experience, because in the community where she lives, it is a very easy activity to do.  The lambs rarely get sick, and there is not much need to buy food, because they take advantage of the fields to feed them.<br \/><br \/>Starting very early, Hilaria sweeps her animals' pen.  At noon she takes them out to pasture and leaves them tied up while she takes advantage of the time to clean her house.  Once the sun starts to set, she puts them back in the pen.<br \/><br \/>Hilaria loves to raise her little lambs, because from a young age, her parents involved her in the care of the animals they had at home.  Now she has seven lambs, which will be ready to sell in December.  Her earnings will help her cover household expenses and her children's education, but then she will not have enough left to re-invest in small animals.  That is why she is applying for a loan, with which she will be able to continue her business.  <br \/><br \/>Fortunately, Hilaria is very well known in the community, and her customers come to her house to buy directly from her.  \"I have been raising lambs for many years, and I have always tried to give a good price so that they come back,\" says Hilaria.<br \/><br \/>Juan, Ra\u00fal, and Julia, who are the remaining members of the group, also make their living raising lambs.  They all have a lot of experience taking care of animals and know that the best season for sales is coming, since people from the community have parties and celebrations for the end of the year.<br \/><br \/>The members are very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva, because they have helped them improve their businesses and their quality of life.  Hilaria wants to continue raising and fattening lambs to cover the costs of her children's education, because she wants to continue supporting them financially.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken

The Kapsowar area of Kenya has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. \r\n\r\nErick\u2019s upbringing was very challenging, and because of this, he promised himself that he would work hard to get out of poverty, which is why he started farming six years ago. Through farming, he has been able to earn a decent income. Erick is the breadwinner of his family, and this really pushes him to work hard so that his family will have a bright future and his parents will have a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nErick is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming so that he can use the excess space on his land. He dreams of buying more land and increasing his farming. Accessing funds is very difficult for men who are smallholders in Africa, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Erick is optimistic that his dream will be realized and his life will completely change. Through the income from horticultural farming, Erick will assure his family of a bright future and will be able to pay tuition fees for his child and siblings who depend on him.

the area of Lahore, Pakistan. He owns a general store in which he sells shampoo, bath soaps, detergents, biscuits, rice, sugar, cooking oil, etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store, as well. His relatives also like to purchase items from his general store. \r\n\r\nM.Fiaz speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relations with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town.

In those days teaching was limited since there weren't many people trained to teach and so he only studied this far. To continue with his education he would have had to travel to the city and his parents' finances did not stretch to covering the expense.\r\n\r\nSantiago has had a partner for 23 years. His life partner does domestic work and together they have worked and managed to raise a family of five children. They are all adults and only one son is studying, in ninth grade. The others are working and have their own families now.\r\n\r\nSantiago works in agriculture. Currently he has 14,000 square metres planted with corn and 7,000 square metres of beans, which enable him to meet the needs of his household. He has done this work all his life, because starting when Santiago was little his father taught him everything about it. Years ago he also worked as a machinery operator, working in the streets and in many other construction activities.\r\n\r\nThe land he works on is 1km away and he gets there on foot. He involves his younger son in the work and also pays for labour in order to be able to do all the daily tasks. The working day is from 6am to 12 noon.\r\n\r\nSantiago will use the loan to pay for labour and machinery to harvest his crops, since the harvest time is approaching, and with this he will be able to satisfy the need to be able to provide basic grains for the household.\r\n\r\nSantiago's dream is to able to continue working to help his family get on in life and he hopes his children will become decent members of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1745935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for labour and machinery to harvest his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-12-10T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-24T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":32.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":34.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":36.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.28},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.45},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":812162,"name":"Fahriddin","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"  \u0424\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u0445\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435. \u0424\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0442, \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 7 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435 ZAFIRA \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u0417\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434 -

Los integrantes del grupo son Manuel, Amelia y Gabriela quienes invertir\u00e1n en la venta de fantas\u00eda; Victoria, en trastes; Icela, en productos de limpieza y Jos\u00e9 Manuel, en nopales para su venta. \n\nDo\u00f1a Teresa es una mujer muy amable siempre est\u00e1 muy sonriente aunque es un poco discreta con lo que dialoga, en la comunidad le dicen de cari\u00f1o Tere, tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada desde hace 20 con el se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9, juntos formaron una familia con cuatro hijos todos ellos se encuentran estudiando. Don Jos\u00e9  platica que toda su vida se ha dedicado al comercio de art\u00edculos de temporada debido a que sus padres tambi\u00e9n eran vendedores. Cuando decidi\u00f3 formar su propia familia con Do\u00f1a Tere, se independiz\u00f3 pero busc\u00f3 nuevos puntos de venta para no competir con su pap\u00e1 ni sus hermanos.\n\nDo\u00f1a Tere comenta que al ver que con el comercio se obten\u00edan buenas ganancias, se dispuso ayudar a su esposo. Ya son 15 a\u00f1os de actividad y los ingresos han ido aumentando lo que ayuda a solventar los gastos del hogar y de la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Dependiendo de la temporada del a\u00f1o Tere vende distintos art\u00edculos, el d\u00eda de muertos vende flores y adornos, herramientas en la \u00e9poca de cosecha de ma\u00edz y en otros meses art\u00edculos de fantas\u00eda, frutas y verduras. \n\nTere compra toda la mercanc\u00eda en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico en cantidades grandes para poder obtener un mejor precio y revenden en fiestas, ferias y plazas ya que no cuentan con un establecimiento, la pareja camina por las calles para no pagar cuotas por establecerse en alg\u00fan espacio fijo.

They are neighbors and have known each other for several years. They still maintain their native language, traditions, and culture, but above all, they are united by their strong friendship. The other members of the group are Manuel, Amelia, and Gabriela, who will invest in and sell costume jewelry,Victoria, who sells kitchenware, Icela, who sells cleaning products, and Jos\u00e9 Manual, who sells prickly pears. \r\n\r\nTeresa is a very courteous woman. She is always smiling, although she is a little bit reserved in conversation. In the community, they speak of Tere with affection. She is 35 years old and has been married since she was 20 to Se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9. Together, they have formed a family with four children, who all are in school. Don Jos\u00e9 says that all his life, he has worked selling seasonal items because his parents were also vendors. When he decided to start his own family with Do\u00f1a Tere, he started out on his own, but looked for new sales locations to avoid competing with his father or his siblings.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Tere says that upon seeing that good earnings could be obtained through sales, she made up her mind to help her husband. They've been in business for 15 years and their income has been growing, which helps them pay their household expenses and their children's educational expenses. Depending on the time of the year, Tere sells different items. At the Day of the Dead, she sells flowers and adornments; during the harvest, she sells tools, and in other months, she sells decorative items, fruits, and vegetables.\r\n\r\nTere buys all the merchandise in large quantities in Mexico City so that she can get a better price. They resell it in festivals, street markets, and plazas, since they do not have an establishment. The couple walk through the streets to avoid paying fees for establishing their business in a fixed location. Their work schedule is from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., and they are always aware of the openings of new plazas in order to add new sales locations. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Tere is very grateful to VisionFund because, thanks to their economic support, her business is stable and she is able to continue having the chance to offer her children a professional career.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken at Tere's house.

Here is his story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cI have a family of five people: my father, my mother, me, my younger sister and younger brother. My father is a driver. Sometimes he repairs cars and has additional salary. My mother is a housewife because of my younger siblings. They both have problems with their health, and mother has to stay with them at home the whole day in order to give them medicine, to help them to reach the room, and to feed them. <br \/><br \/>We showed them to the doctors and tried to treat them for their illnesses, but without a change, as they need to be cured just in Moscow or in Israel. We are not able to buy all their medications in Kyrgyzstan, and treating them medically abroad is out of the question for my family, which is terrible torture for us. I do my best to help my family at home; I help my mother with the household and support my father in washing and repairing cars.<br \/><br \/>Therefore, I firmly decided to rely only on myself, to prove to myself that I can learn English and become a student of a good university. A good university means a good and high-quality education, which helps to fight poverty and inequality and to spur lasting progress. AUCA is the most prestigious university in Central Asia. Although the tuition at AUCA is very expensive for my family, I made up my mind to study here.<br \/><br \/>This year I finished AUCA New Generation Academy, as I have been lucky to win an AUCA scholarship. Each year, the NGA awards full scholarships to a total of 70 applicants drawn from all seven regions of the Kyrgyz Republic to study at the NGA, which offers a one-year course of study that aims to prepare its graduates for university education. After my studies at NGA, now I can\u2019t imagine myself without AUCA. I am very lucky, happy and proud to be a student of it. <br \/><br \/>I am asking for a loan to pay for my university tuition. I await your mercy and thank you for your time and attention to my

En esta comunidad adem\u00e1s, una de las actividades principales es la elaboraci\u00f3n del llamado \u201cpan de monte\u201d o \u201cpan de piojo\u201d.\nDon Hip\u00f3lito, uno de los integrantes del grupo ha pasado la mayor parte de su vida cerca de los hornos. Recuerda que desde peque\u00f1o, su abuelo y su pap\u00e1 le ense\u00f1aron la elaboraci\u00f3n del pan y su abuelo era muy conocido en la regi\u00f3n no solo por el gran sabor de las piezas que horneaba sino por la amabilidad con la que atend\u00eda a sus clientes. \nA los 15 a\u00f1os Hip\u00f3lito inici\u00f3 su propio negocio haciendo pan aunque le era dif\u00edcil transportarlo por la falta de un veh\u00edculo, utilizaba su peque\u00f1o burro para llevar de un lado a otro las cajas de madera llenas de pan. Todas las ma\u00f1anas sal\u00eda de casa a las 5 am para poder recorrer tres o cuatro comunidades y regresaba hasta las 7 pm. \nAhora Don Hip\u00f3lito es padre de familia, se cas\u00f3 con Juana y tiene siete hijos, de los cuales dos ni\u00f1as a\u00fan dependen de la pareja. \u00c9l contin\u00faa con el mismo negocio y cuenta con la ayuda de su esposa.

Las ganancias m\u00e1s recientes le permitieron comprar dos camionetas donde ahora transporta el pan. Su nueva meta es vender pan a otras tiendas  para que m\u00e1s personas prueben el sabor del pan que hornea. \nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Cristina, nuera de Don Hip\u00f3lito, quien tambi\u00e9n se dedica a vender pan y Don Seberiano, gran amigo de Hip\u00f3lito desde hace varios a\u00f1os, quien invertir\u00e1 en mercanc\u00eda para su tienda de abarrotes. \n*La foto fue tomada en el parque del municipio, un lugar concurrido por estudiantes y amigos que aprovechan el espacio para convivir y platicar.

The members are very proud of being in a place of such cultural richness, friendly people, and many celebrations that provide more color and coexistence to their days.  Making what is referred to as \u201cMountain Bread\u201d or \u201cLice Bread\u201d is one of the main activities in this community.\r\n\r\nHip\u00f3lito, one of the group\u2019s members, has spent most of his life around the ovens.  He recalls that his father and grandfather taught him about bread baking. His grandfather was very well known in the area, not only because of the great flavor of the bread he baked, but also for the friendliness with which he served his customers. \r\n\r\nAt age 15, Hip\u00f3lito started his own business baking bread, although it was difficult to transport it for lack of a vehicle.  He used a small donkey to take the wooden boxes of bread from one place to another.  He would go out every morning at 5:00 am so he could cover three or four communities and he would return home at 7:00 pm.\r\n\r\nNow Hip\u00f3lito is a father.  He is married to Juana and has seven children and two daughters are still dependent on this couple for support.  He continues in the same business with his wife\u2019s help.  He was able to improve his baking area with his earnings and he and his wife begin working the dough daily at 4:00 am so they can sell it in town in the evenings.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love my work because I make a living with it and my children grew up with it,\u201d he states proudly.  Hip\u00f3lito also shows his gratitude to Vision Fund and Kiva because, thanks to the loans, he was able to invest a little more and buy ingredients in greater quantities.

Meet Margaret, 56 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kwanza, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and is blessed with eight adorable children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last 15 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable.  She stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman, accessing funds is very challenging.  Through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market.

Ella se dedica a vender antojitos en su casa iniciando a las 6:30 pm y terminando hasta que el ultimo cliente se vaya o los antojitos se terminen.\n\nLa motivaci\u00f3n principal para continuar con su actividad es su madre, la se\u00f1ora Laura, quien inicio el negocio hace m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os vendiendo tacos dorados en el centro del municipio y posteriormente una mayor variedad de antojitos mexicanos. Desde peque\u00f1a, Vero y sus tres hermanos apoyaban a su madre atendiendo a los clientes \u201crecuerdo cuando mi madre vend\u00eda en el centro y mi hermana mayor era quien nos cuidaba\u201d admiraci\u00f3n y respeto es el que tiene Vero por los dos grandes ejemplos que tiene en su vida. \n\nDesde hace 10 a\u00f1os Vero se ha dedicado a vender tacos dorados utilizando la receta de su madre, el puesto lo coloca debajo de un techo que han establecido, pone una gran mesa donde prepara la carne y enrolla los tacos para despu\u00e9s fre\u00edrlos en una cacerola grande. Vero utiliza las ganancias obtenidas para apoyar con los gastos en casa, reinvertir en la compra de ingredientes y material para el negocio y hacer cada uno de los pagos correspondientes a los pr\u00e9stamos anteriores. Esta vez, Vero necesita surtirse de m\u00e1s ingredientes como chile, cebolla, aguacate, crema, frijol, aceite, tortillas, queso, servilletas, palillos, gas pues con el inicio de la \u00e9poca de corte de ca\u00f1a en su comunidad, las ventas incrementan y quiere prepararse para satisfacer las necesidades de los clientes quienes acuden a comprar por el buen saz\u00f3n que tiene.\n\nTodos los d\u00edas Vero agradece a Dios por la gran familia que le ha brindado ya que actualmente tambi\u00e9n uno de sus hermanos la apoya en su actividad. Tambi\u00e9n comenta que se siente muy afortunada por estar con sus padres y cuidar de ellos como en un principio lo hicieron con ella. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el lugar donde el grupo lleva a cabo sus reuniones.

The members decided to name their group \"Las Rebeldes,\" making reference to their personalities. \"We are rebels with a cause. Our cause is to take care of our businesses and our families,\" says one of the VisionFund clients.\r\n\r\n\"Las Rebeldes\" are as follows:\r\n\r\nPetra - Pork Sales\r\nMar\u00eda Irene - Clothing and Shoe Sales\r\nGuadalupe - Tamale and Handmade Tortilla Sales\r\nFilomena - Food Sales\r\nRoberta - Grocery Sales\r\nGelasia - Grocery Sales\r\nLaura - Drink Sales\r\nMar\u00eda - Dessert Sales\r\nVer\u00f3nica - Selling popular food items for 10 years. She is 31 years old.\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel - Catalog Shoe Sales\r\nAlicia - Lingerie Sales\r\nMaricela - Vegetable Sales\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica is better known as Vero. She is single and 31 years old. She works selling popular food items in her house, starting at 6:30 p.m. and finishing when the last customer leaves and the food is gone.\r\n\r\nHer main motivation for continuing in her business is her mother, Se\u00f1ora Laura, who started the business more than 30 years ago, selling fried tacos in the center of town; later, she sold a larger variety of popular Mexican foods. Since she was little, Vero and her three siblings helped their mother by tending to customers. \"I remember when my mother was selling downtown and my older sister was the one who took care of us.\" Admiration and respect are what Vero has for the two role models that she has in her life.\r\n\r\nSince she was 10 years old, Vero has worked selling fried tacos, using her mother's recipe. She sets up her stand under a roof that they have established, puts out a large table where she prepares the meat and rolls the tacos, and then fries them later in a large pan. Vero uses the earnings she obtains to contribute to the household expenses, to reinvest in the purchase of ingredients and supplies for her business, and to make every one of her payments for her previous loans. This time, Vero needs to stock up on more ingredients like chiles, onions, avocado, cream, beans, oil, tortillas, cheese, napkins, toothpicks, and gas, as sales increase with the start of the cane cutting season in her community.

The name of their group comes from the fact that the Guatemalan tradition of flying giant kites on the Day of the Dead originated in Santiago. The women range in age from 21 to 40 years and their businesses include sales of vegetables, food and clothing. Many of the group members speak the Mayan language Kaqchikel as well as Spanish, and most of them wear the typical indigenous skirts and blouses. They are hard working women and many of them get up at dawn to travel to the locations where they sell their products. These women are eager to be part of this group as they want to grow their businesses and profits and improve their living conditions. In the course of their nine months with Namaste they will receive classes in business literacy, managing their money and keeping books.  They will also each have a business adviser who will help them write a business plan and also give them monthly advice on how to grow and improve their business.\n\nHilda (first from left) is one of the members of this group. She is 26 years old, married and has two children, ages 2 and 7. Her husband is a driver. The seven year old goes to school. Hilda herself only went to school through first grade.

The majority of the group works in creating the artisan textiles that are popular, such as shawls, scarves, purses, huipiles (typical blouses), and curtains. \n \nIsabela is the President of the group and is a good leader. She is 25 years old and has had nine years of education. A few years ago, she acquired a tuc-tuc.  Tuc-tucs are three-wheeled covered motorcycles that are used in small villages throughout Guatemala as a type of taxi transporting people from one place to another. She needs to maintain the vehicle constantly, which can be very expensive. It is for the maintenance that she is requesting a new loan, especially to buy new parts for the tuc-tuc. Isabela hopes that with the new profits from her tuc-tuc, she will be able to continue to provide a primary school education for her child. Driving a tuc-tuc allows Isabela to be very independent but it does have its problems. \n \nThe empowerment of the ladies of the Trust Bank \u201cLas Gemelas\u201d is notable. Thanks to the non-formal education program of Friendship Bridge, the ladies have gained a great deal of knowledge about savings, overindebtedness, good health practices, child development and self-empowerment.

Atitl\u00e1n in the highlands of Guatemala. Many tourists travel here by small boat to learn about natural dyes. Thread, yarn and cloth are colored by a variety of these dyes using avocado, charcoal, coconut shells, cochineal (an insect that grows on a cactus pad), fruit and fruit seeds, as well as tree bark.\n\nThe seven members of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cDel Carmen\u201d are happy to report that they have finished paying the previous loan cycle that was generously funded by Kiva investors, and now they are applying for their second loan cycle. The group has elected Rosa as the secretary. She has a textile business, and has a little stand near the public beach where she sells traditional textiles like colorful purses, shawls and other lovely items. Because of the tourists who come to San Juan, Rosa has been successful with her business. She realizes that this time of year draws more tourists to the town, and so in order to be ready she wants to increase her inventory, so she is applying for a new loan to buy yarns and fabrics for sewing. Along with the other members of the Trust Bank, Rosa is requesting a loan that she hopes will be funded by Kiva investors.\n\nThe members of the Trust Bank share a common goal, which is to increase their income by expanding their businesses and improving their quality of life. Besides having access to loans, they receive educational training during their monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. It is the combination of the loans and educational training that comprises the Friendship Bridge \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program. \n\nThank you, Kiva investors, for taking the time to read about the ladies in this Friendship Bridge Trust Bank. They are poised to step into a brighter and more prosperous future with their small loans and acquired knowledge.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1738663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Their ages range from 26 to 64, and all have businesses such as selling tortillas, chickens, cosmetics, second hand clothing and shoes. These are women with little knowledge of money management and business administration, few economic resources, but with strong goals for their businesses and themselves.They are all eager to participate in the Namaste program because in the past they have received loans that did not come with any education and didn\u2019t provide much in the way of positive results for their businesses. With Namaste they will receive classes in financial literacy and also a personal business adviser who will help them write a business plan and give them advice on how to manage and grow their businesses. \n\nDora (third from right) is one of these ambitious women.  She is 52 years old and has a fifth-grade education.  She is married with five children, only one of whom, at 15, is still at home and in school. Her business is making and selling tortillas and she is starting to expand into selling other kinds of food as well. Her husband helps her in the business part time when she needs to get wood or carry corn to the mill. She provides about half the support for her family, working about eight hours a day making and selling her tortillas.

She has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that she names each of them. \r\n\r\nMargaret dreams of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Margaret is kindly requesting 41,200 Kenyan Shillings to purchase a high yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, she will have more milk for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, she will be able to service her loan on time. \r\n\r\nWith increased income from the loan, Margaret will be able to cover the high farming cost of production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high cost of inputs. However, with increased income, Margaret will not take such measures.

the father of three children.  He has a higher education and works as a teacher in a boarding school.  Additionally he works in merchandise transportation and would take any job to feed his family.  For the past 15 years he has also been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture in order to provide his family with an additional source of income.  Thanks to his persistence and determination, he currently owns three dairy cows, two young bulls and 10 sheep. He also grows barley and clover on 2.4 hectares of land.  Halbek wants to increase his livestock headcount, and this is the reason why he has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS).  He will use this money to buy two steers.

She tells us there were days when she did not sell a single item. This made her look for other alternatives to generate income. Because of this she supported herself by offering services as a stylist. This is why she decided to work solely as a hairdresser, since she had taken some courses in this job in order to be better. She arranged her place with a chair, a sink to wash hair, a mirror; and she kept the glass counter from her general store where she now exhibits her beauty products. She has had this business for 14 years already. Her main customers are her neighbors in the neighborhood where she lives, located in the municipality of Barranquilla. She offers her services from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. every day. She buys her inputs on cash at special department stores, specialized in hair salon products. Currently, she is requesting a credikiva,  the first loan she does with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy hair salon inputs such as dyes, hair products, nail polishes, and also some building materials such as cement, sand, etc. because she is improving her place in order to make it more attractive to her customers. Paulina is 58 years old. She has a 15 year old son to whom she wants to give a better quality of life. Therefore, she wishes to have a house and giver her child an education.

At the age of 32, she has decided to take charge of her life along with those who stand with her. She is the leader of a women's Self-Help group called \u201cGulab Mahila Samuha\u201d. All the women in the group live in the Rupsagar village in the Deoghar district, Jharkhand. The group, under her leadership, has jelled well and, apart from sharing their rituals and festivals, they share the dreams of a better tomorrow. She has her own goat farm. A local NGO 'MESP\u2019 has trained her in modern and scientific practices of livestock business.  Bindiya purchases lambs and goats from the market, raises them for 8 to 9 months with regular vaccinations and checkups from veterinarians. Once the livestock are ready, she sells them to local buyers. Every day in the morning, Bindiya takes the goats to graze in the fields. Bindiya has four children. They are living in a hut due to their economic condition.  Bindiya plans to purchase more livestock so that she can expand her business. For this reason, she is requesting this loan.

It is often referred to as Xelaj\u00fa or Xela by the local people which means \u201cunder the 10 mountains\u201d in the local indigenous language. The official town was founded by the Spanish in 1524 by conquistador Pedro de Alvarado and it currently has a population of 200,000 people.\n\nIn a rural area outside of the city, 10 women have formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cCari\u00f1o\u201d meaning \u201cAffection, Dearness, Kindness\u201d. One year ago, they received their first loan from Kiva which was invested by the women in their small businesses which include animal husbandry (chickens, pigs and cattle), vegetable sales and textile production. These ladies reported that they have just finished making their final payment and are requesting a second loan.\n\nPreviously, we reported on Mar\u00eda Beatriz who used her loan to purchase more corn for her \u201ctortiller\u00eda\u201d where she makes tortillas three times each day. She was not only able to maintain her business but also increased sales with additional customers. Maria, another member of the Trust Bank, used her previous loan for her agricultural business where she works along with her husband. The couple have five children and want to use their income to improve their family's nutrition and to take care of their children\u2019s educational needs. Maria is requesting a new loan to purchase cabbage, broccoli and carrot seeds. However, she also has another business and raises animals to fatten and sell. She will use another part of her loan to purchase a bull to fatten and sell, creating additional income for her family.\n\nThe 10 women in the \u201cCari\u00f1o\u201d Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings where they socialize, make payments on their loans and participate in educational seminars on topics that affect their daily lives. A Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares timely information about a variety of relevant subjects like self-esteem, women\u2019s rights and health. Their businesses benefit when they gain knowledge about accounting, budgeting, customer service, marketing and pricing. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\n\nThank you, Kiva investors, for your generosity and kindness for these women who want to empower themselves and eliminate poverty in their lives. We look forward to providing a follow-up report in the very near future!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6000,"image":{"id":1740891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He is finishing his second year of technical studies which has helped him put into practice all he has learned throughout his training. Trinidad always knew his passion would take him into accounting and administration, so he had no doubts about this field of study. He works as an operator in a duty free area and has been able to pay for his education by himself, while becoming a capable, determined, hard-working, responsible young man.\n\nFor Trinidad, having to work has never been an obstacle standing in the way of his education. On the contrary, it has encouraged him to take advantage of his youth to continue his studies to find new work opportunities.\n\nTrinidad is requesting a loan to pay for his Accounting Technician diploma, which he always has wanted. He plans to continue his education and also learn English which is a requirement for most jobs.  He trusts he will receive the loan and be able to look for other work opportunities. He will meet his goal and continue to study and grow professionally.  One of his future goals is to take other courses.

Poultry farming is cheaper to run, and the demand for chicken products is always high. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Jovia will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her is timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met.

The earnings from the store gave Aaron's parents the possibility of providing their children with a better quality of life.  Now the business remains open every day until 8pm, and if some customer comes to look for milk, water, coffee, sugar, or any other products, Aaron serves them without any problems.\r\n\r\nIn the harvest season (the season when the cane is cut) Clara tends to the store while Aaron works hauling cane to the mill (sugar factory), and also must watch over the burning, cutting, and cultivation of the sugar cane. \r\n\r\nAaron uses the earnings and investments from loans to buy more merchandise, including: rice, beans, soups, sugar, coffee, milk, flour, lime powder, canned chilis, cheese, ham, sausages, drinks, etc.  In addition, he has been able to remodel the store, and he even hopes to expand it, thinking of his family's future.

Meet Nancy, 42 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Matunda, a remote village in Kitale area of Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with two adorable children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 40,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nBeing a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved, knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going child.\r\n\r\nNancy hopes to make progress as a poultry farmer and have a more stable income\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375.8,"image":{"id":1752649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-11T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-25T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.6,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.89,"local_amount":6212.45,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6307.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824483},{"amount":71.09,"local_amount":6319.33,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6416.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264767},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":9466.42,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":9611.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.44,"payment_id":681377843},{"amount":59.88,"local_amount":5649.69,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5736.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.68,"payment_id":711505824},{"amount":62.28,"local_amount":5756.49,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5844.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.48,"payment_id":731022634}],"funded_date":"2014-12-14T02:43:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":811713,"name":"Muhabat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muhabat lives with her husband and two children in Tajikistan.

Born in 1983 in the Nandi region of Kenya, Caroline has grown up to be a very hardworking and enterprising woman. <br \/><br \/>Her upbringing was not easy but at least she managed to finish her primary education. She is currently running a 1.5 acre mixed farm in Kabirsang village with the unwavering contribution of her dear husband. She keeps poultry, sheep and dairy cattle that give her eggs, meat and milk to sell. <br \/><br \/>Caroline is seeking a loan to purchase land. Since 2000, when she ventured into farming, she has been relying on her husband's farm to run the agribusiness, and still will. However, the business has grown and all the space is totally utilized.

They are the parents of two boys, one is 8 and the other is 12, and they both study in a local school. She says that four years ago she opened a small grocery shop, for which she set up a room in her house, and she would sell through a large window. After her mother got ill, she had to move to Veracruz to care for her, and had to close her shop.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is once again requesting a loan from VisionFund, as she wants to reopen her grocery store and again have an income without neglecting her family.

She has a business making and selling plaster handicraft products.\r\n\r\nRitha is enterprising, patient, generous, understanding, responsible and hard-working. She has her business in the rural \"El Torno\" area where there are businesses specialising in producing meat, vegetables, fruits and other products. There are also wholesale distributors who sell products to the city\u2019s different markets and supermarkets. \r\n\r\nWith a tropical and humid climate, the temperature here swings between 18 and 35\u00baC.\r\n\r\nRitha is dark skinned and short; she has long black wavy hair and speaks Guaran\u00ed as her native language. She also speaks Spanish for her business. (In the photo, Ritha is sitting on the right in navy blue shorts). Ritha shares her life with her husband, a driver, and their son who works and studies. The family lives in a house that they own. The house is made of bricks and has running water and electricity.\r\n\r\nRitha\u2019s desire to get ahead have brought her to create a loan group with people with the following types of businesses: restaurant, businesses selling soft-drinks, shirts, baby clothes, crisps, sports clothes, meat, and a corner shop. The group has come together in order to apply for a loan and expand their businesses. \r\n\r\nRitha herself has a business selling plaster handicraft products. The main products that she needs are moulds (usually made of silicon), plaster, water, mixing bowls and oil. \r\n\r\nRitha carries out the following steps to make products: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tShe fills the mould with water to see how much plaster she will need;\r\n\u2022\tShe moves the water to the bowl and begins, gradually, to add the plaster until the water has been absorbed;\r\n\u2022\tShe transfers the resulting paste into the oiled-up mould; \r\n\u2022\tOnce full, she shakes the mould to get rid of bubbles;\r\n\u2022\tRitha then waits 20-30 minutes before removing the product from the mould.;\r\n\u2022\tShe then trims of any excess on the edges;\r\n\u2022\tShe leaves the statues to dry over one or two days; \r\n\u2022\tFinally, she sands the figurines, if necessary, before painting them.\r\n\r\nRitha says, \u201cMy work began because of a need to make Christmas figurines: angels, doves, and the three kings. Then I started going to fayres and I made piggy banks. The business moved along these lines and I am still working in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nRitha\u2019s dream is for her daughter to have a profession. Ritha wants to buy work supplies in bulk in order to take advantage of end-of-year sales. This is Ritha\u2019s third loan in five years with the organisation. Ritha works independently.\r\n\r\nRitha is applying for this loan in order to buy plaster materials in bulk in order to increase production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1746010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy plaster in bulk in order to increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-11T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-25T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ritha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marilyn Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eloina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisbet Asunci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3277.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3371.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3467.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3565.81},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3667.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3771.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3879.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":478.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":520.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":566.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":478.56,"local_amount":3277.84,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-18T10:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3282.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595157412},{"amount":998.39,"local_amount":6838.27,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6849.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554336},{"amount":520.61,"local_amount":3565.81,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3571.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226874},{"amount":535.43,"local_amount":3667.32,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3673.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214050},{"amount":550.67,"local_amount":3771.72,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3777.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564179},{"amount":566.34,"local_amount":3879.04,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3885.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046163}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T03:10:30Z","paid_date":"2015-06-17T13:09:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":813004,"name":"Youssou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Youssou travaille comme mobilisateur communautaire depuis des ann\u00e9es.

They are the parents of five children although only one daughter depends on them.  \r\n\r\nMartina is asking for a loan to buy more checked fabric, thread, worsted wool, chickens and sheep. For 17 years, she has worked making napkins, table cloths, and other items, as well as raising and fattening chickens and sheep. She started her activities because she wanted to help with the household expenses and her children's education expenses, because her husband's salary was minimum.  \r\n\r\nFor Martina, it hasn't been difficult having three businesses because she cares for the animals in the morning, and takes them to graze in the pasture,. At midday she spends more time moving them to a different place and feeding them again. Doing the embroidery is what she spends the rest of her time on every day. It can take her up to 20 days to finish a piece. At times, people from her community order different embroidered pieces to deliver to celebrations for baptisms, first communions, confirmations, etc. \r\n\r\nMartina isn't worried about competition in her community because she already has regular customers and she always tries to do her work with the best quality so that they will keep recommending her. Her only dream is to keep growing in her businesses to help with the household expenses and improve her home. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":1746017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more checked fabric, thread, worsted wool, chickens and sheep.

This is true for Sarah, who is based in the Kitale area of Kenya and is a mother of two lovely children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past four years and has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nSarah passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking Daddy (the name of her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbours and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. \r\n\r\nThe dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Sarah is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also to start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. \r\n\r\nAn improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":398.94,"image":{"id":1752698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-11T12:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-25T12:20:05Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2944.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3118.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3209.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.71},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.26},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3499.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3601.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3707.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3815.51},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3927.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4041.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":6806.47,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7014.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824487},{"amount":76.14,"local_amount":6668.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6872.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264769},{"amount":35.25,"local_amount":3087.36,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3181.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459425},{"amount":81.95,"local_amount":7345.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7569.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.92,"payment_id":681377845},{"amount":48.08,"local_amount":4468.79,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4605.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.95,"payment_id":711505826},{"amount":72.06,"local_amount":6562.03,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:42Z","rounded_local_amount":6762.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.87,"payment_id":731022636}],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T14:27:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charmaine Dymond","image":1085001}},{"id":807226,"name":"Gloria Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria es una mujer emprendedora de 56 a\u00f1os de edad, que desde muy joven se interes\u00f3 en aprender a cocinar y con el apoyo de su c\u00f3nyuge quien le ayud\u00f3 a iniciar el restaurante, en el a\u00f1o 2010 empez\u00f3 a funcionar, desde entonces ella ha ofrecido comida t\u00edpica como sancochos,  pescados, arroces entre otras delicias a sus clientes que en su gran mayor\u00eda son empleados de obras en construcci\u00f3n o contratistas de empresas a quienes les ofrece facilidad de pago.
