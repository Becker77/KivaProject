Though they have different businesses to generate income, they face a lack of finances when there are few customers and low demand, resulting in a low household income. They can't pay their children's monthly educational expenses on time when business is bad. Therefore, Hineilhing would like to take an educational loan for their eldest son, Ngamgougin, a 14-year-old boy studying at V. M. Nazareth English High School, so that their dearest son could study wholeheartedly. Their son takes a keen interest in his studies and always does well in his exams. He is well-mannered and loves to spend time with his parents. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to pay the annual school fees and admission fees for the 2015 session. The loan will enable her son to join school on time. She is very grateful to Kiva for their endless support to her family. She sends her thank you to the lenders.

Ahora que la \u00e9poca de cosecha de ca\u00f1a ha iniciado en su regi\u00f3n, vende refrescos a la gente que trabaja en los sembrad\u00edos.

For the same reason, two years ago he decided to begin selling soft drinks in his house to increase his income. Commenting on how he came to start his business, Ricardo says that there were customers who never finished paying and he thought about ending the business, but after considering the help it meant for his mother, he continued working and today, he sells a greater variety of flavors of soft drinks and in larger quantities. Presently, sugar cane harvesting season has begun in the region, and he is selling soft drinks to workers in the fields. Ricardo enjoys this season, not only because his earnings increase but because he likes the smell of burned cane after the workers burn off the land.\r\n\r\nRicardo needs a loan to invest in drinks of different sizes as well as disposable cups to help refresh the people who work all day long in the fields. He says \u201cI give thanks to God for permitting me to be who I am and giving me the large family that I have. They are my principal motive for continuing to work so hard.\u201d\r\n\r\nNaranjal is the name of the group, located an hour from the center of the municipality.

Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports.

She is a 46-year-old, farmer from Kapkoi village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. She lives together with her husband and nine children on a small piece of land, where she keeps poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. For ten years, her primary sources of income have been eggs and horticultural produce. Her biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs.  Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. \r\n\r\nBeneditor made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. Sometime last month, she applied for a loan for expanding her horticulture farm. This will enable her to expand her operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to her children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out to start working to contribute their earnings to their families.

She also grows maize, among other crops. \r\n\r\nDespite prevailing animal diseases, Margaret finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. \r\n\r\nMargaret, however, is taking this a little step further. Margaret is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes. The demand for vegetables and other greens is always high. Income from this venture will cover the high farming expenses she has to deal with currently.

His parents taught him the trade 15 years ago. He sells his product in the market and around his community, and thus has an income to improve his family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to maintain his banana plants, as it is very important that the plants produce premium quality fruits so that he will not lose customers he counts on.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to plant more banana trees, and to see his children grow and become professionals, and to build a home to have more adequate living conditions.

The lady standing in the middle raising her hand in the photo is Shantilata. She hails from a lower middle class family and lives with her husband and two children in a small tile house.\r\n\r\nShantilata has been running a paper plate and cup-making business in her house for the last five years with the help of her husband. At present she has one paper plate-making machine. She supplies her products to retailers of the same town and other villages in a ten-mile radius. She purchases raw materials from the nearest wholesale market, 200 kilometers away, on a monthly basis. \r\n\r\nThis is her only source of income and she gets a monthly income of 5000 INR from this business. Out of this income she is hardly able to manage her household and business expenses. For her quality product and timely delivery, the demand for her unit is increasing day by day, but she is unable to meet the demand of the customers due to insufficient production due to lack of sufficient money. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nFor this reason she formed a SHG (Self Help Group) named Maa tarini B with ten other like-minded women entrepreneurs from her locality and got a loan. From the present loan Shantilata has planned to purchase another paper plate making machine and raw materials like silver laminated paper, silver paper, gold laminated and gold paper, foil covered paper and poly-coated paper in bulk. She is very much hopeful that this will not only reduce her purchasing and transportation costs but also help to generate some additional income.

She has children, and she works in a garment factory. She was employed through the assistance of Covenant Community Service Cooperative*.\r\n\r\nJoan is a Roving Quality Control Officer. She inspects garments, such as men's denim bottoms, during manufacturing operations to determine the number of defects per worker and reasons for rejects by examiners. She collects measurements, such as the number of pattern parts, layers of cloth prior to cutting, and number of stitches per inch during sewing operations.\r\n\r\nOne of the main dilemmas of employees like Joan is the improper balance of their salaries with family expenses. They have no access to savings or credit, a situation that makes them heavily indebted to usurious money lenders who capture their automated teller machine (ATM) cards as loan collateral. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Joan is asking for your assistance to prevent her from being exposed to loan sharks. She has previously accessed loans through CCT Credit Cooperative, and she had no problem in repaying the loan because the loan payment was deducted every pay day. She looks forward to your positive response; any amount coming from you will surely be of great help. She will use the loan for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nJoan wants to be promoted as supervisor someday or become a successful businesswoman. She dreams of giving her children a better future. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work. \r\n\r\n* The Covenant Community Service Cooperative works to provide local communities with a labor force trained and equipped with the skills required for deployment in construction and site development projects. The cooperative prepares its members to acquire these skills, qualify for jobs, cultivate savings consciousness, and provide decent shelter, food, and education for their families. Its core programs are the following: Professional Staff Services Program, Workers Guild Development Program, Enterprise Development Program, and Consultancy Services.\r\n\r\n** CCT staff and volunteers regularly conduct fellowship meetings for the factory workers before starting their daily work routine. Bible readings, prayer devotions, spiritual mentoring, and discipleship sessions take place during pre- and post-working hours and breaks, powering up the lives of both volunteer leaders and line workers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1739928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To pay for the educational expenses of her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laguna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-11T21:50:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-25T21:50:27Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134350},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757118},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200256},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186550},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.7,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649535637}],"funded_date":"2014-12-12T02:40:12Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":799991,"name":"Roselynita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roselynita is 41 years old and a married woman with five children.

Not only was this contaminating the watersheds, but it was also producing greenhouse gases and attracting swarms of flies.

As you can see in the photo, she has a bakery in a building made out of boards. This is a rather unstable material that could fall at any moment, but she continues working. This bakery is how she supports her family. She is shown in the photo with her daughter.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to be able to one day buy a house. She wants one that is not made of wood, which is what is usually seen in her neighborhood, an area that suffers from a lot of poverty and armed conflict. She wants a house made of quality construction materials.\r\n\r\nShe knows that to achieve her dreams, she needs to improve sales, gain more customers, increase her productivity, have a sustainable business, offer new products, and increase her inventory. But she can't do any of this without an oven to make the bread.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is requesting a loan that she will use exclusively to buy an oven to cover her needs, always keeping in mind that her living conditions are going to improve by it.

To get to their meeting location you have to go about 35 kilometers along a highway surrounded by fields of cane, rubber, peppers, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, bamboo, limes and oranges.\r\n\r\nThe name of this group comes from a flower in the region. The active members of the Musaneda group are:\r\nLeoba - vegetable sales\r\nPascuala - candy sales\r\nLiliana - food sales\r\nMargarita - tortilla sales\r\nAntonia - clothing sales\r\nDeysi - fruit and vegetable sales\r\nSenobia - cosmetics sales\r\nMaria Salome - snack sales\r\nAlexis - paper product sales\r\nEva - clothing and food sales\r\nBarbara - catalog clothing sales\r\nElvia - jewelry, clothing, lingerie, tupperware and food sales\r\nLizbeth - catalog clothing sales\r\nJoel - computer equipment maintenance\r\n\r\nDeysi is 31 years old. She is the single mother of a six-year-old son, Cristofer, who attends the preschool located one block away from their home. Deysi has always had the support of her parents and siblings to provide for Cristofer. She decided to begin selling fruits, vegetables and legumes four years ago. She sells from her home, and is able to help people in her community purchase the ingredients they use the most in their food preparation. People typically need to travel up to 30 minutes to purchase or obtain from other providers who sell the same supplies but come to their community every once in a while. But their products aren't of very high quality and the prices are very high.\r\n\r\nDeysi needs to purchase tomatoes, chiles, onions, cilantro, carrots, chayote, chard, pumpkins, cabbage, lettuce, jicama, plantains and apples to continue offering the service of a mini-vegetable shop to her customers. She has also been thinking about adapting or building a small space out of wood to expand her business, and in this way arrange all of her products better. \r\n\r\nSometimes, in the afternoons, Deysi also cuts coffee, or to poke the rubber trees which grow nearby her house to extract the material and to put it up for sale to earn some extra money. Deysi's main motivation is her son, and for his sake she knows she needs to expand her business to increase her earnings.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the rubber field adjoining Deysi's house.

She launched her business so that she didn't have to stay at home alone, and as a way to augment her family's income. Additionally, she can count on the support of her family: her husband Tirso always goes with her to buy the clothes, and Nuria (her daughter) looks after the store while her parents go out to purchase merchandise. On the other hand, her son recently suggested that she grow the store and start renting video games to children and young people - he himself offered to help look after those sales in the afternoon after finishing his homework.\r\n\r\nSandra is grateful for the opportunity to receive a loan to grow her business.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken in the home of Alicia, who is wearing a striped blouse.

She is 25 years old. She lives in the Shahrituz district. Nigora is married, but does not yet have children. She lives with her husband and parents-in-law. Nigora does not have a college education. She is goal-oriented and hardworking woman and this is why she does not sit at home doing nothing. Nigora manages to concurrently be involved in household work and working on a livestock yard. Nigora has been involved in animal husbandry for about 4 years.
