She is from Litein, Kenya, a community not known for farming but she is earning a living through agriculture. For the past five years, she has been practicing mixed farming. Because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from her fellow farmers and she is regarded as a mentor. The income from milk, eggs, and tea selling have allowed her to earn a good income. To earn extra income, Betty engages in a small personal business. \r\n\r\nBetty passionately loves dairy farming.  Milking and feeding her co makes her very proud. Through selling milk, she has seen very good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers, then sending text messages to her customers when milk is ready for collection, and because of using ICT, she has had a comparative edge in her dairy business. Demand has been overwhelming and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand. \r\n\r\nBetty requested a loan, which she will use to buy a quality dairy cow. She wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day.

make their way in the world. But Janet, 37, who is based in the Litein area of Kenya and is a mother, has been practicing mixed farming for the past eight years. She has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nJanet passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated, \u201cFeeding my cows.\" Her hobby is milking Seroi (her dairy cow). She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot fully meet it. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. \r\n\r\nThe dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to a higher profit margin and an increased income level. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nJanet is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling, and also through selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":374.08,"image":{"id":1753403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-12T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-26T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.32,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.71,"local_amount":4843.94,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264783},{"amount":40.3,"local_amount":3504.36,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3637.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649600990},{"amount":85.15,"local_amount":7578.46,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7865.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2,"payment_id":681377856},{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":3570.6,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3705.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.22,"payment_id":696587524},{"amount":31.78,"local_amount":2932.82,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3043.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.95,"payment_id":711505835},{"amount":66.59,"local_amount":6022.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6250.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.66,"payment_id":731022648},{"amount":45.39,"local_amount":4076.39,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4230.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.49,"payment_id":752110858}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T17:49:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":807871,"name":"Johanna Maricela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johanna de 27 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada y tiene un hijo de 4 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta bachillerato, quer\u00eda seguir estudiando pero no ten\u00eda como pagar sus estudios.

Zamira intends to improve her family's financial situation and, to accomplish this, is planning to start a new animal husbandry business.

","en":"32-year-old Volida is a resident of the B. Gafurov district of the city of Khujand. She is a seamstress and has been involved in sewing for 5 years. Her husband is a housing repair contractor. Two of their daughters attend a school, and their son is still very young - he is 5 years old. In the district, where Volida lives, electricity in turned off and provided in minimal amounts during the winter period.

She started pursuing her passion in the year 2009. She is a hard-working and honest farmer who is based in Kapkoros, a remote village in the Litein area of Kenya. She is a proud mother. For the past six years she has been making a small living through mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. Cynthia passionately loves dairy farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan which she used to buy an additional cow. She paid the loan back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. Cynthia is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. The cow she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-20 liters of milk a day. A liter of milk costs 50 KES; this means she will be making 11 USD a day. From this loan, the life of Cynthia will permanently change and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children. She will also assure her aging parents of a secure future. Cynthia waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1753460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-12T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-26T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cynthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":111.61,"local_amount":9920.96,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":10095.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264784},{"amount":51.58,"local_amount":4585.22,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4665.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459436},{"amount":102.48,"local_amount":9302.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9465.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.17,"payment_id":681377858},{"amount":127.74,"local_amount":12026.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12237.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.55,"payment_id":711505837},{"amount":263.77,"local_amount":24165.16,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":24589.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.1,"payment_id":752110860}],"funded_date":"2014-12-12T20:07:24Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":812292,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She has worked hard to provide them with the best education for a bright future. Nida came to Lebanon to work as a housekeeper, but her acquired income isn't enough to cover their increasing living needs. Thus, she started her own Filipino cooking business to increase her income and make sure she can develop her children and family's living. Her acquired loan will be invested in developing her cooking business, especially for the coming Christmas and New Year seasons where she must be ready for customers' requests, and she will send part of the loan to her beloved family to enjoy the coming Holy Seasons.\r\n\r\nNida is the lady at the center of the picture with pink top.

who has two children and lives in the village of Igoji in the Nkubu area of Kenya. \r\n\r\nAs a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Gicici self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor the past four years she has been actively involved in mixed farming, and because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and fuel wood, in addition to household chores, childcare, and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a setback because Sabinah has been making great profits in farming. \r\n\r\nNkubu is one of the places that has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming; that is, good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Sabinah has always wanted to diversify and start horticulture farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds to get the business off the ground. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to start horticulture farming.

She has been giving her best for her children. As their income is fixed within limits, it is difficult for her to pay annual fees for all her children at one time especially at the beginning of a new session. So with the Kiva loan, she will pay the annual fees for her son, pictured with her. She will also pay for his textbooks, exercise books and school uniforms for the new session. \r\n\r\nNengneichong is very happy and content with the loan. Her financial pressures are now diminished.

This is true for Jane, who is based in the Nkubu area of Kenya and is the mother of two lovely children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. She has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal business she engages in to makes extra income. <br \/><br \/>Jane is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking and feeding her cow. <br \/><br \/>A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from getting diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.

Nevertheless, she has always had the strength to come out ahead and continue progressing with her family. She has spent the past seven years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in a personal business to make ends meet. Julia is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. \r\n\r\nOf all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her animals. She is so close with her animals that she has nicknamed one of them \u201cKipara,\u201d meaning no feathers on the head. Julia wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan of 50,000 KES, which she will use to buy additional poultry. With your loan, Julia will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money. Julia is very concerned about her children\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay their school fees. Julia dreams of a secure future for her children. She awaits your kindness. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 45% of Kenya's gross domestic product, generates 70% of Kenya\u2019s export revenue, and employs approximately 70% of Kenyans. Despite the importance of agriculture to Kenya and its economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition, because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Kenya remain underserved by financial institutions. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":486.67,"image":{"id":1753540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

children. He was born and grew up in the countryside and since childhood was tamed to hard work in the field. After graduating from school, he would have enrolled in a university but at that time his parents did not have the resources to pay for his education. Therefore, he continued to engage in livestock breeding with his father. Currently, he tends to livestock on his own plot of land.

Meet Doreen, a 30-year-old mother who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Doreen is a mother of one lovely child who she really adores so much and will always do anything good so that the child never goes to bed with a hungry stomach. <br \/><br \/>Doreen hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya. Doreen never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white-collar job, but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Doreen started farming and has been doing farming for the past three years. Through those years, she has gathered so much experience, and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. <br \/><br \/>Doreen practices mixed farming on her farm, and through the profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and also give her child a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. <br \/><br \/>Doreen is a woman who is very enterprising, and she is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil, and a ready market for horticulture products, Doreen wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Doreen to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Doreen hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Doreen's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Through this, she will be able to assure her child a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Doreen is not a selfish woman and will also want to impact positively on society; that is why she will employ people to work for her on her horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":294.06,"image":{"id":1753659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She lives with her partner and has two children who are 33 and 30 years old. Her business is a hardware shop.\r\n\r\nShe is enterprising, optimistic, generous, courteous, happy, committed to her work, responsible, and hardworking, and she has a good attitude. She runs her business in the Plan 3000 zone, an area known for its multi-cultural inhabitants; the place was populated by immigrants from the Ayoreo ethnic group and miners relocated from the west. Now their second generation works in commerce and manufacturing. The climate is warm, tropical, and humid, with an approximate ambient temperature of 21-35 degrees celsius, which varies during the day and throughout the year.\r\n\r\nJosefa (in the center, wearing a blue flowered blouse and a black skirt) has dark skin, short stature, and long hair worn tied back. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish for business. She shares her life with her partner, who works in transportation, and her children, who are now independent. She and her spouse live in a house that they own; it is made of brick and cement, and has potable water, electricity, and a sewer system. \r\n\r\nThe need to improve their income led her to form a communal bank of people with business (like fried potato sales, sportswear sales, a neighborhood shop, a meat market, sandwich sales, an artisanal plaster business, and drink sales) to request a loan and expand their businesses.  \r\n\r\nJosefa's business is the sale of construction materials like paint dyes, sandpaper, plastic tubing, wheelbarrows, shovels, plaster, etc. \"My work is a prosperous business because houses and buildings are constantly being built, and the customers place orders for new and old-fashioned products,\" she says. Her dream is to open a location in a central, commercial area. \r\n\r\nShe would like to make an investment in her business through the purchase of construction material at wholesale in order to stock up and supply her business for the season. This is her first lending cycle with the institution in the 11 years that she has been running her business.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons that Josefa is requesting a loan for the purchase of

Even though some people in the village, including Tor, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. Tor and other filter users also decrease the amount of money spent to boil water by purchasing less charcoal and decreasing the time spent foraging for firewood. Tor's filter is guaranteed for two years, though most users find the filter works from three to five years.

The silver nitrate-infused ceramic element removes and destroys bacteria and similar agents of waterborne diseases. Bounma's village takes water from relatively shallow wells and from local streams; however, the water from natural sources in his village is dirty and unsuitable for drinking without treatment. Even though some people in the village, including Bounma, are able to buy bottled water, the water filter increases disposable income to users by decreasing the amount of money used to purchase bottled water. Bounma and other filter users also decrease the amount of money spent to boil water by purchasing less charcoal and decreasing the time spent foraging for firewood. Bounma's filter is guaranteed for two years, though most users find the filter works from three to five years. Most families report a threefold reduction in diarrhea after they begin using the filter. Increasing time available for productive work also improves a family\u2019s income and over all well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1750484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to purchase TerraClear water filters so they can have access to safe drinking water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LA","country":"Lao PDR","town":"Borlikan District, Borlikhamxai Province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":393,"posted_date":"2014-12-13T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-27T00:00:07Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bounma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khampheang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khamfai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounyu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"E","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoumee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maibua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Latsamee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pheang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xone","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vone","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ko","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Xeang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Phonexai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lhonesavanh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LAK","disbursal_amount":9800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T13:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3024193.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611965669},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-23T11:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1008064.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637757995},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T15:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1008064.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649742497},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T15:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1008064.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665232167},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1008064.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":698012252},{"amount":350,"local_amount":2800000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2822580.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711675400}],"funded_date":"2014-12-16T17:42:45Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T18:49:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":807915,"name":"Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Catalina de 57 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer valiente y trabajadora que habita en vivienda propia junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus 7 nietos por lo que se siente muy feliz de poder contar con este beneficio de un lugar donde vivir.

Meet Windrose; as her name suggests, she is a \u201cRose.\u201d She lives in the Litein area of Kenya, renowned for producing long-distance elite runners who have broken world records in the Olympics. Windrose is a mother, and she has been in the agricultural business for 10 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and vegetables. Windrose has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, rising prices of farming inputs, such as fertilizers, and fluctuations in the market prices of farm products are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Windrose remains positive and passionate about her economic activity.<br \/><br \/>Windrose is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of her business least affected by harsh external conditions. A poultry farm is cheaper to run, and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Windrose will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profit.

Meet Sophia, 30 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer. She lives in Magumango, a remote village in Chuka. She is happily married and has been blessed with three, adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years, and she has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops, from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small, personal business.<br \/><br \/>The Chuka area is densely populated, and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, Sophia finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging. With institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo (partnering with Kiva), she feels relieved, knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level.<br \/><br \/>Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry offerings to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going

Esteban supports one of his daughters, as well as his wife\u2019s relatives.\r\n\r\nFive years ago when Esteban started his company, he knew it was a good idea. \u201cBusinesses are good as long as one makes the effort, is determined and exercises imagination.\u201d His clients include plant nurseries, commercial properties, and residential properties. He is also working on expanding the business, exporting tractors for agriculture to Colombia.

After this happened, she decided to go back to working with people with special needs, by getting a job at a property management company that housed seniors. \r\n\r\nWorking with special needs adults reminded her how much she loved to help people though her work. She started thinking of a way to give back to the community, while doing what she was most passionate about: real estate. It was then that Gratitude Real Estate was born. With every home sale she makes, Jessica gives back 15 percent of her commission to the charity of the buyer\u2019s choice. \r\n\r\nJessica will use her Kiva loan to pay for marketing as well as

All these animals produce important quantities of manure, and Fernando has been looking for a waste treatment solution. Since he found out about Sistema Biobolsa and his biodigester has been installed, he is putting his animals' waste in the system, turning his farm into a cleaner place and above all producing his own biogas and organic fertilizer at no cost! He is looking forward to completely displacing the expensive LP gas and unsustainable chemical fertilizers he uses on his field, which will result in significant money savings. His animals' waste will not attract flies anymore, nor contaminate underground water sources, and his wife will be able to cook using biogas instead of the wood she used to collect in the surroundings every day.

By using her biodigester and taking advantage of her animals' manure to produce her own biogas and biofertilizer, she is looking forward to living in a more sustainable way, transforming waste into resources. Prior to this investment, her cows, horses, sheep and poultry were producing important quantities of useless waste, which was contaminating and attracting swarms of flies. Using the waste as the main input for her biodigester allows Griselda to treat it and become more self-sufficient in terms of energy supply and fertilizers. She can now cook with biogas instead of wood, eliminating the toxic smoke from her house and reducing deforestation. The nutrient-rich and organic fertilizer produced by bacteria inside the biodigester will nourish the soil of her field and increase the yield of her vegetables, corn and oats, which she partly sells in the local market. She aims at expanding her vegetable production to diversify her family's food sources.

Meet Uslizar. Uslizar is a one of the Ruma agents who lives in Bekasi, the satellite city located in the east of Jakarta. Uslizar is happily married, and he and his wife have been blessed with two daughters; one is 13 years old, and the other one is 3 years old. \r\n\r\nAs the head of the family, his main source of income comes from the small stall he manages that sells snacks, drinks, and mobile phone airtime credits, and provides utility bill payments service.  It was about three months ago that Uslizar met a Ruma field staff who introduced him to Ruma. He decided to join Ruma by selling mobile phone airtime credits and servicing utility bill payments to his surrounding community. Uslizar now has become a successful agent since his customers are people in the peri-urban area who are in needs of access to such services.\r\n \r\nAs the business continues to run, Uslizar hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile airtime and bill payment transactions, especially on the weekends. In the near future, Uslizar plans to add more products from Ruma to the things he serves, such as e-commerce for low income communities.

Winarsih has become the pioneer in her community in providing mobile payment services. \r\n\r\nAs the demand for transactions increases, Winarsih is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. She will use the capital to process more mobile airtime credits and utility bill payments transactions, especially on the weekends. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Winarsih is the woman standing on the left with her friend who is a Ruma agent on the right.

She has been helped by other boards. She has sold all her pigs and has earned a satisfactory profit. She has saved all the profit and will be using it later for business capital.\r\n\r\nThe Tunas Rahayu group has received a new loan of 15,000,000 IDR. The loan will be used to increase the number of piglets, renovate their pens and purchase superior feed. The group still needs a loan until they have enough capital to run the business by themselves. Now they already have savings and are using them for capital.\r\n\r\nAyu Komang is using the loan to purchase two superior quality piglets and pig feed.

Meet Caren, a youthful 26-year-old mum, a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nandi, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Caren is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with one lovely child. For the past 7 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, tea, cabbage, tomatoes and also, she keeps dairy cows. Caren has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. <br \/><br \/>Caren mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Caren is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetable and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Caren is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Caren feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. <br \/><br \/>The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Caren will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market hence increased income level. Caren is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Caren will improve her living conditions and assure her child, siblings and grandchildren to come of a secure future.<br \/><br \/>Support this woman with a loan and makes her dreams a reality!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":934.61,"image":{"id":1754048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to deliver products to the market in a timely manner.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-13T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-27T16:00:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7077.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7284.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7497},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7716.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7941.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8173.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8412.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8658.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8911.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9171.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":9439.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":9715.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":194.31,"local_amount":17272.33,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":17575.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824532},{"amount":153.23,"local_amount":13620.73,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":13859.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264795},{"amount":89.78,"local_amount":7980.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":8120.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459446},{"amount":89.17,"local_amount":8094.48,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8236.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.89,"payment_id":681377867},{"amount":100.97,"local_amount":9228.47,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":9390.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.85,"payment_id":696587533},{"amount":92.62,"local_amount":8719.84,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":8872.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.48,"payment_id":711505846},{"amount":196.92,"local_amount":18160.77,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":18479.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.39,"payment_id":731022658}],"funded_date":"2015-01-12T01:14:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":812699,"name":"Odette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Odette is 41 years old.
