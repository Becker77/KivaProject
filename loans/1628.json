Kamobo area has only one agro dealer who is catering for thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on them for agricultural inputs.  Betty will help the smallholder farmers in this area who for a long time have been having a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. \r\n\r\nThrough your loan, Betty will change from the peasant farmer she is right now to a certified agro dealer who will be depended on by nearly 2000 smallholder farmers in her area both for input, knowledge and information about improved inputs. Through increased income from the loan she will improve her living conditions, and her future plans are to purchase a truck which will be used to engage farmers in output marketing activities. \r\n\r\nBetty believes that youths like her can find farming rewarding.

Despite everything, we are happy to have a big and friendly family, where everyone cares for others.\r\n\r\nSince the 9th grade I have had a dream to study at AUCA. AUCA is the most prestigious university of Central Asia. It provides accredited degrees from Bard University in New York. Besides, it has majority of partner programs with many universities of the world, where AUCA\u2019s students can study by Exchange Study programs.

I am a freshman in the Business Administration Department, which prepares experts in Business Administration, Accounting, Management, Human Resources, Marketing and so on.

Meet Monica, a 36-year-old mother who is very kind, loving, and charming. She is based in Kapcheno, a remote village in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. She is happily married and has two children that depend on her for their basic needs. For the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming on her small piece of land. Her major primary sources of income are egg selling, crops, and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves poultry farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d \r\n\r\nShe sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. Because of high quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound, and the demand has been overwhelming. To be able to meet the demand, she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan, she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity, and hence, satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nThe increased income level will be used in improving her living conditions, and she plans on expanding her business to other towns. Other than increased profits, she will also benefit from the poultry manure, which will be used in her vegetable garden to increase productivity. Increased profits will make her business flourish, and hence, provide a secure solid education to her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":484.82,"image":{"id":1754217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-14T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-28T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.02,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.91,"local_amount":8339.96,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8684.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824542},{"amount":57.07,"local_amount":4962.53,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5167.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264800},{"amount":57.9,"local_amount":5034.76,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5242.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601001},{"amount":27.84,"local_amount":2420.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2520.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459451},{"amount":32.88,"local_amount":2916.9,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3037.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"payment_id":681377871},{"amount":75.17,"local_amount":6915.8,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7201.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.36,"payment_id":711505850},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":2478.97,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2581.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1,"payment_id":731022661},{"amount":101.52,"local_amount":9088.94,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9464.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3,"payment_id":752110869}],"funded_date":"2014-12-16T23:40:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":812791,"name":"Yahuza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yahuza is a maize farmer from Gabas village in Kaduna state.

She is married to Saidamin, a vendor, and has children. She and her husband work hard to provide for their family and to support their children's schooling.\r\n\r\nJulieta is in the food business. She has operated a food stall for 10 years. In the Philippines, a food stall is a common sight, especially in populated areas. People in the working class usually buy their meals at food stalls, where food is sold at reasonable prices. They buy for the convenience and to save money, because it costs more to cook at home. They just eat their homecooked meals at the end of the day with their families. \r\n\r\nJulieta is good cook, which is why her food stall is popular with neighbours and the local working community, who serve as her regular customers. She is also a dealer of cellular phones, a business that her husband manages. She earns a minimum net income of 2,000 Philippine pesos per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her maintain her business, Julieta is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP to buy additional raw ingredients, such as pork, fish, chicken and seasonings that are needed for her cooking. Her income from her food stall helps cover the family's daily living expense and her children's schooling. She thanks God and you in advance for the financial help that she will recieve. \r\n\r\nJulieta dreams of building her business to secure the education of her children. She wants her children to finish their studies until college, to get good jobs and uplift their lives. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet weekly. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1754044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fresh meat, vegetables, oil and other ingredients needed for her food stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-14T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-28T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":140.03,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T11:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6240.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595134503},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4160.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611757277},{"amount":93.32,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4160.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624200415},{"amount":23.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1040.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636186697}],"funded_date":"2014-12-14T13:22:50Z","paid_date":"2015-04-17T11:48:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":812797,"name":"Davit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Davit, 27, lives in the village of Shikahogh, in the Syunik Region of Armenia.

Meet Everlyne, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandihills area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley. \r\n\r\nEverlyne, 43, has been farming for the past 10 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Everlyne is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. \r\n\r\nAlthough she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nandihills area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Everlyne could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Everlyne, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. \r\n\r\nEverlyne believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Everlyne to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":421.66,"image":{"id":1754251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-14T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-28T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.5,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3184.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3277.85},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3373.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3573.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3678.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3785.65},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3896.29},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4010.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4127.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4247.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4372.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.09,"local_amount":7567.99,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7614.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824546},{"amount":78.05,"local_amount":7024.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7067.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264802},{"amount":81,"local_amount":7289.58,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7334.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459453},{"amount":85.12,"local_amount":7867.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":7915.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.3,"payment_id":696587537},{"amount":87.9,"local_amount":8198.82,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8248.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.2,"payment_id":731022663}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T19:31:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":812801,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Elizabeth.

Aside from her food stall, she also has a mini-lumber business from which she also has derived income for ten years already. Her earnings enables her to support her family and meet their daily basic needs. \r\n\r\nShe would now like to apply for another 30,000 loan. This time she will use the loan to pay for raw wood and equipment for cutting wood to sell as lumber. People in the province still prefer wood in building their houses and rest houses for people from the city as it provides more comfort and warmth, the Philippines being a tropical country. Her income is a big help in their everyday expenses. She is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and  the financial assistance that will be given to her. She wishes everyone a Blessed Christmas!\r\n\r\nMa.Celita dreams to grow and be more successful in both her lumber and canteen business. She aims to improve their quality of life and prays for healthy living. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1752343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to pay for raw wood and equipment to cut wood to sell as lumber.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-12-14T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-28T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

world. She is blessed with three children, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. On her farm, Naom grows maize, has a dairy cow, and keeps poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize, and when she is not farming, she engages in some personal business to help supplement the meager income she earns. However, despite the meager earnings, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction. \r\n\r\n\"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" she says. Naom's biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. For a farmer, this means  business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Naom formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. \r\n\r\nWith her previous loan, Naom purchased a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful). Mrembo produces milk daily, which Naom sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not very affected by sudden changes in weather if you have stored feed,\" says Naom. The money Naom earned from selling the milk was adequate to repay her loan. \r\n\r\nToday, she is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Naom is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good livelihood."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1754330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-14T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-28T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.87,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.91,"local_amount":8166.52,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8504,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824548},{"amount":89.6,"local_amount":7791.06,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8113.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264803},{"amount":92.96,"local_amount":8083.85,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":8417.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459454},{"amount":290.66,"local_amount":25958.57,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":27031.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.87,"payment_id":696587538}],"funded_date":"2014-12-14T16:39:05Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Camille Ricketts","image":991896}},{"id":812881,"name":"Marika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marika is 26 years old.

I was selected as a student who had good scores and was in need of financial aid, so was awarded a full scholarship for one year of study at this program. New Generation Academy opened my eyes and gave me new hope for a bright future, and belief in myself. \r\n\r\nIn summer I successfully passed AUCA\u2019s entrance exams and became a freshman. I have a lot of responsibility in my studies as my parents have to pay for them. AUCA professors use modern education technologies, develop critical thinking skills, share their knowledge and experience, and create a very friendly atmosphere. AUCA is a student's dream university, but not everyone can afford it.\r\n\r\nMy family consists of six people: my grandmother, my parents, me and two siblings, who are studying at school. My grandmother is retired and helps my mother to take care of my siblings. My father is a history teacher by trade but is unemployed due to his eye disease. Therefore my mother is the only provider in my family. She doesn\u2019t know what it is to be tired and does her best to earn more money. Due to increasing living costs, my family\u2019s income is not enough anymore even to satisfy my family's needs. \r\n\r\nI am not indifferent to my family\u2019s situation. I believe that, \u201cA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\u201d. I am asking Kiva lenders for a favour with the first step. Then I am sure that I can and I will make the next steps myself in order to be able to contribute to a better standard of

district in Odisha, India. She belongs to a Muslim community and resides in a slum area with her two sons and daughters-in-law. The lady standing second from left with her hand raised in the photo is Kariman. She is a very headstrong, confident lady who is heading her five-member family.  \r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, Kariman faced a lot of difficulties in maintaining her family. So she decided to go for an income source and for the last 10 years, she has been running a garment business in her house itself. Apart from that, she has been running a tailoring unit with two sewing machines. She takes orders for stitching of ladies garments from her locality. Her elder son helps her in this business. Her younger son is working in an auto repair center. Kariman earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from the above businesses, which is very little to manage her family. She is very much worried about the future of her sons and she never wants to see her family in trouble. Therefore, she wants to earn some more income by expanding her business for the secure future of her sons. To materialize her dream, Kariman, along with the other seven like-minded women of her locality formed a Self Help Group to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.  \r\n\r\nWith the present loan, she wants to purchase ready-made garments, a pico machine and some cloth for stitching of ladies garments.

area. Even with savannah plains and little human activity, there exists a farm that stands tall, a farm with over 2 high-pedigreed Friesian cows, producing over 30 litres of milk. It\u2019s quite an outstanding feat, considering the harsh terrain and other handicaps, like the lack of electricity from the national grid and also because of being dependent on traditional methods of harvesting water. \r\n\r\nKiva lenders, meet Godwin, the man credited with the success story of the farm. He is a loving husband and has been farming for the past 10 years. Godwin passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that he knows his cows, each individually, because he works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. He and his wife have even named one of them \u201cBirirmet\u201d. Because he loves the cows, he runs his operation by four simple rules that have kept him and his herd happy. The rules are: breed them well, feed them well, clean them well and milk them well. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that he engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nThe income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve. He is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo serves poor smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to the farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like dairy cows, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. Through this loan from Kiva lenders Godwin will buy not just an ordinary cow but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan, and will also go towards the education of his children. He will also benefit from the cow manure which will be used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan he will also be able to build a bio-gas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. \r\n\r\nThis loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions. Godwin waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":382.12,"image":{"id":1754409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is a forty-nine-year-old smallholder farmer from Kongoni village in the Kitale area of Kenya. Like most farmers in the region, Peter practices mixed farming. He keeps dairy animals and grows maize among other crops. He has been doing this work for a decade now. Over the years, he has come to like farming because it is a sustainable and self-fulfilling investment. Farming doesn\u2019t take all his time, so he is also able to attend to his \u201cside hustle\u201d job. A delicate balance of both jobs has enabled him to comfortably raise his six children. Peter is seeking a loan to buy poultry and build a chicken coop. He is ready to get into commercial production of meat, eggs and, perhaps, feathers. This business is very profitable but it does not require a licence, a big space or product marketing. There is an established market for poultry products in almost all places around the world. Besides, chickens will bring many non-monetary benefits to Peter\u2019s farm. Chickens will be great for his farm's compost because their poop is high in nitrogen; in free-range, they will naturally forage by scratching soil looking for bugs, which aerates the soil and breaks up vegetation for decomposition. Peter will also use your money to build a chicken coop in order to make the raising of chickens easier.

She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Nancy\u2019s source of income are vegetables, milk, and egg selling; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that she faces is delivering to the market on time. The Nandihills area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Nancy is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. \r\n\r\nUsing the motorbike, she will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh.

As a child, Caroline was very focussed on school, sports, and music. Having 14 siblings and being the last born girl, she was surrounded by all the love and attention in the world. While still young, she constantly dreamed of going to schools that have a variety of academic options where she would have the opportunity to showcase the creative and innovative sides of her personality.\r\n\r\nAlthough Caroline was a good student academically, she faced serious challenges stemming from being a girl in a family that is so deep-rooted in Kalenjin traditions. She seemed to handle these challenges well through primary education. Much to the delight of her parents, who were hardworking farmers, Caroline passed the national examination with flying colors and was admitted to a high school after a competitive application process.\r\n\r\nHowever, things started tumbling down when her father passed away right after Caroline started high school. The absence of a will set in motion a succession battle, which brought out the ugly side of close people she thought she knew all her life. In the end, she was left with nothing. She had no one to run to because even though the courts had granted women equal rights to inheritance, the stubborn persistence of patriarchy among the family members saw that Caroline\u2019s rights remained contested. She had to do a series of menial jobs in order to pay for her tuition. After high school, she went ahead and attained a certificate in Business Management and later a Diploma in Human Resource management.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, she landed her first \u2018real\u2019 job as an office assistant in Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that serves rural smallholder farmers across Kenya. She made the best of the position by putting her own creative and innovative spin on how to bring transformation to the lives of rural farmers locked in poverty. Within a short time, she was made a Business Development Officer, where she continued to perform dazzlingly. Today, Caroline is the Branch Manager of the leading office in terms of growth and performance!\r\n\r\nCaroline is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to complete the payment for a course in Sociology. She decided to enroll in sociology after her leadership position presented her with certain challenges in regards to the understanding of human social behavior. She is confident that sociology will make her a better leader who has a developed body of knowledge about social order, social disorder, and social change. This course will equip her with invaluable knowledge and skills to influence a culture of positive change among employees as well as farmers.\r\n\r\nCaroline stated, \u201cMy goal is to provide the right environment, so that employees can work together and tap into their innate creativity to solve business challenges. My dream is to be a role model to my 4-year-old daughter. Everything I do is meant to shape her identity and make her experience the world as a free place where she doesn't have to limit herself to the roles that society foists on her. To do all this, I am counting on your consideration and support. Thanks.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":217.53,"image":{"id":1754432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She also makes her living mainly with agricultural work, but because of her age, she delegates these activities to other people and she only contributes. \r\n\r\nAlba asks for a loan to buy fertilizer, seeds, and insecticides to have supplies ready to sow. Living near a river gives Alba's family the opportunity to sow throughout the year. Alba dreams of having the strength to continue this work and to have a market stall in her town.

Especially impacted are households headed by women who suffer from a lack of assets and access to resources. Friendship Bridge, through its \u201cMicrocredit Plus Program\u201d that combines small loans and education, is a beacon of hope for over 22,000 impoverished women in Guatemala who are seeking their own solutions to poverty.\r\n\r\nKarla, who is 32 years of age, has joined with six other women to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEl Arco\u201d in the town of Chichicastenango. She is married and has three children. Karla is beginning her second loan cycle with the organization and the first with Kiva. Four years ago, she began a snack business that has grown throughout the years. Karla needs additional capital to purchase pots, a blender and other supplies so that she can sell more delicious traditional Guatemalan snack foods like tamales, enchiladas and rellenitos. In Guatemala, \u201cRellenitos de platano con frijoles\u201d are stuffed plantains with beans and are very delicious. With the additional income from her business, Karla dreams of seeing her children complete their education and lead successful lives.\r\n\r\nThe women of the \u201cLos Arcos\u201d Trust Bank have various businesses like the fabrication and sale of traditional textiles and handicrafts as well as snack sales. They learn how to successfully manage their loans with educational seminars at their monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer who teaches them in their own indigenous language, often using games, pictures and role playing. The women gain useful business tools (effective business planning, budgeting, marketing, customer service and pricing), knowledge about nutrition, health and the use of medicinal plants as well as violence against women and sexual education.\r\n\r\nKarla and the women in the Trust Bank appreciate the opportunity to secure a loan and learn about the world around them and within them. Kiva investors are valued partners in this effort.

Most of the people of this village are poor and depend upon cultivation and labour. But some of the people have adopted other sources of income for development of their families. Hemalata, aged about 38 years, is one of them. The lady standing second from the right in the photo and raising her hand is Hemalata. She lives with her husband, two daughters, and one son. Two of her children, except the elder daughter, are continuing their study in the local school.<br \/><br \/>Hemalata has been running a small general shop in her house for the last ten years with the help of her husband. She sells general grocery items such as rice, oil, sugar, tea, soap, washing powder, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks, toffees, eggs, etc. All types of daily need items are available in her store. <br \/><br \/>Apart from this, she also sells milk from her two milking cows. Her net monthly income from the existing business is Rs. 6,000. Out of this income, she hardly manages all her business, education, and domestic expenses. <br \/><br \/>Hemalata has so many dreams, but due to her scanty income she could not even think to fulfill these. Therefore, she wants to increase her income by expanding her milk-selling business.

He graduated 3 years ago from high school. He had to make a great effort to attend school, traveling by bus every day to arrive. On weekends he had to work to cover his own expenses and in this way he helped his mother as well.  Adan's mother and sister depend on him economically. Today he works as a vendor in a hardware store. He has worked there for 3 years. When he left to study they gave him the opportunity to work in that hardware store in the city. He traveled every day 30 minutes by bus, waking up at 4:30 AM to arrive to work on time. Previously he worked in a bakery for 2 years.<br \/><br \/>Adan seeks a loan to install a door on his home as the one currently in place is damaged. The door is valued at $350.00. The rest of the loan will be used to buy a sewing machine for his mother as she works as a seamstress. In this way he hopes to live with his family in a much more secure home.

She used the profit fully to support her children's educational needs.\r\nNow the group proposes a new loan, still for supporting their pig business. Now the price for 1 kg of pork is 34,000 IDR, the most expensive price for pork ever, maybe because it\u2019s nearly Christmas and New Year's. Ni Kadek will use her portion of the loan to purchase 2 piglets and to fatten the pigs. She hopes the price will still remain high for the next 6 months.

She and her husband work hard to meet their everyday needs. \r\n\r\nOlivia operates a tricycle, which her husband drives, that carries up to four passengers. In the Philippines, especially in the provinces like Silang, a tricycle is a common means of transportation. Jeepneys and buses are limited. Very few people own a vehicle.The townspeople usually ride a tricycle from their homes to market, church, to their friend\u2019s homes and to other destinations within their community. They even transport from one town to the other. She earns a minimum of PHP 700 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan, which she will use for maintenance of her tricycle. It is important that her tricycle is always in  good running condition, to ensure efficient service. She is positive that her transport business will continue as their population increases. Tricycle transportation is really a need in their place. She wishes everyone a Blessed Christmas!\r\n\r\nOlivia plans to buy another tricycle to improve her income and give her family a more prosperous life.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

During the six months of maintaining the pigs, Ni Komang enjoyed satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nFrom the sales, Ni Komang used the net gain of overall sales of her pigs for her children's education and for her family. The group hopes to continue their loan in the second period. They said thank you to the lenders, Kiva and MUK for supporting their businesses.\r\n\r\nNow Ni Komang has a new activity. Besides farming in her garden, she also busied herself raising pigs. In this way, Ni Komang has a higher income than the time before when she was raising pigs. The breeding process is going well without any obstacles. The advantage of raising pigs is that she can use them for everyday family needs.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in the previous period, the Tunas Jaya group proceeded to their next loan. Based on the assessment of MUK, the group received 16,500,000 IDR again. Because most have been able to increase their number of pigs, the current loan is to buy food and fix the cages.

This is not her first credit request. She used the previous loans, all of which she paid back successfully, to buy inventory for her businesses, especially mamalishe cooking items such as rice, sugar, beans, cooking oil, maize, and baking flour, as well as charcoal. She earned a little profit, which she used to pay school fees and some of her household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe is so proud to be a Kiva borrower, and thankful to everyone who supports micro-businesses around the world. With this new credit request she will buy cooking ingredients for her mamalishe business, water, and sacks of charcoal for her store.
