He sells the dish by using a moving cart. \r\n\r\nJumhadi is happily married, and he and his wife have been blessed with a beautiful 2-year-old daughter. Jumhadi joined Ruma two months ago because he wanted to try out selling mobile phone airtime credits and providing a utility bill payment service to his customers. He is excited about his new business and he is quickly learning about how to improve his business using mobile technology. Jumhadi has an advantage in selling such services because of his experience serving his loyal Ketupat Sayur customers. \r\n\r\nAs the business runs, Jumhadi is hoping to get a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to process more mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payment transactions, especially on the weekends.

He was unable to continue his education because his country was suffering through a war. He grew up with his parents, working in agriculture. He is the father of 4 children who he still supports financially. He has been in a relationship for years and his companion works as a homemaker and helps out with their family farm. \r\n\r\nHis father put him to work at age 13, planting corn, beans and millet. He emigrated to another country for a time, where he worked in construction and in local restaurants. Today, he spends his time raising broilers and pigs as well as growing basic grains. He works every day; his wife helps out with the raising of the pigs and chickens, while he works with his children in farming. In the afternoons, when he gets home, he helps out with the chickens.

That way he hopes to give his family better living conditions. \r\n\r\nMatilde's dream is to buy a mill as there isn't one in his community and the residents have to walk a long distance to grind the corn to make tortillas.

She generates additional income from rental rooms. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of Ugandan Shillings 2,000,000 from Kiva partner MCDT- SACCO, in order to enable her to stock more bales of used clothes to sell. Her challenges include seasonality and defaulters. Her dream is to open up another stall in the market for used clothes. She joined MCDT-SACCO because of the relatively low interest charged on loans. She resides in a house with access to both electricity and piped water. Her major monthly expenses include school fees and food.

She has had a small food stall for a number of years already. In the Philippines, a food stall is a common sight, especially in populated areas.  Working class people usually buy their meals at food stalls, sold at reasonable prices, for convenience and to save money, rather than cook at home. The working class just eat their home-cooked meals at the end of the day with their family. \r\n\r\nKhamal Ursula cooks well, and that is why her food stall is popular with neighbors in their area and with the local working community, who are her regular  customers. Aside from her food stall, she also has a small general store by her house. She earns a minimum of Php2,000 net income a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her maintain her business, Khamala Ursula is requesting a Php18,000 loan to buy additional raw ingredients such as pork, fish, chicken, coconut and pineapple juice for her food stall. With part of the loan she will add some grocery items to her store in preparation for the Christmas Holiday. \r\n\r\nShe is thanking God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given her. Khamala Ursula plans to build and expand her business to secure the education of her children in order for them to have a better future.  \r\n\r\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en uni\u00f3n libre con Dami\u00e1n quien trabaja como chofer en los transportes de carga pesada, ellos son padres de tres hijos los cuales se encuentran estudiando.\n\nAli tiene tres negocios: venta de ropa, venta de zapatos y una est\u00e9tica; lamentablemente los negocios no se encuentran cerca y resulta un inconveniente ya que no puede atender las tres actividades al mimo tiempo, \u201cMi est\u00e9tica esta en un buen lugar y si la cambio a mi comunidad seguramente fracasar\u00e1\u201d comento Ali. Donde ella vive, muchas personas saben cortar el cabello, la competencia es demasiada y no habr\u00eda posibilidad de tener la clientela que tiene ahora. Entonces, los negocios de la ropa y zapatos permanecen cerrados hasta que su hija mayor regresa de la universidad. \n\nAli se inici\u00f3 en el comercio vendiendo pollo hace tiempo, pero nuevamente la competencia se hizo presente y cambi\u00f3 a la venta de ropa. Al mismo tiempo su padre comenz\u00f3 a vender zapatos y al ver que era un negocio redituable tambi\u00e9n agreg\u00f3 la mercanc\u00eda a sus ventas. Poco a poco, con sus ganancias y esfuerzo fue adecuando los lugares donde vend\u00eda los productos. Las ganancias eran mejor de lo que ella esperaba y pudo pagar un curso de estilismo que al finalizar, le dio las armas para emprender el sal\u00f3n de belleza. \n\nAunque por el momento, Ali quisiera invertir en botas por la temporada de fr\u00edo que se acerca, en realidad est\u00e1 m\u00e1s apegada a su est\u00e9tica pero no quiere abandonar los otros negocios, pues as\u00ed puede solventar los grandes gastos de educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos ya que su marido ha tenido dificultad para conseguir trabajo. Uno de los grandes sue\u00f1os de Ali es que sus hijos terminen una carrera profesional.\n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes tambi\u00e9n se encuentran por la oportunidad de invertir en sus negocios.

Alicia is a hard-working woman, in her community they appreciate her a lot and with affection they call her Ali. She is 42 years old and lives in a common-law marriage with Dami\u00e1n who works as a driver in heavy cargo transport, they are the parents of three children who are students. \r\n\r\nAli has three businesses: clothing sales, shoe sales, and a beauty salon. Sadly, the businesses are not nearby, and it is an inconvenience since she can't take care of the three businesses at the same time \"My beauty salon is in a good location and if I move it to my community, surely it will fail,\" said Ali. Where she lives, many people know how to cut hair, there is too much competition and there wouldn't be a possibility of having the customer base she has now. Then, the clothing and shoe businesses are closed until her oldest daughter gets back from the university. \r\n\r\nAli began in the business selling chickens a while ago, but again there was competition and she changed to selling clothing. At the same time, her father began to sell shoes and upon seeing that it was a profitable business, again she added the merchandise to her sales. Little by little, with the earnings and her efforts, she adapted the places where she sold the products. The earnings were more than she expected and she was able to pay for a stylist course and upon finishing it, she struck out to open a beauty salon.\r\n\r\nAlthough for the moment, Ali would like to invest in boots for the cold season that is approaching, in reality she is more attached to her beauty salon but she doesn't want to give up her other businesses because with them she can pay her children's large educational expenses since her husband has had difficulty finding work.

Every day, Avelina opens her shop after dropping off her little one at school. At midday she closes again to get him at school and eat with her family, in the afternoon, the two go back to the shop and continue selling while she helps him with his homework. \"More than his mother, I am his best friend,\" Avelina says, since the boy tells her everything. \r\n\r\nThe idea to sell clothing came up from her enjoyment of shopping, she always traveled to the country's capital to purchase clothing for herself and her son. On day, her parents encouraged her to buy more clothing and when she returned to the community she began to sell it as a street vendor. Now she has a fixed locale and she reinvests her earnings in casual clothing for women, men, and children, in addition to meeting the needs she and her son have. Avelina needs a loan to take advantage of the cold season that is approaching and purchase vests, sweaters, sweatshirts, and jackets, among other clothing because although the region where they live is warm, during December and January there is a drop in the temperature.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for the opportunity to grow with our businesses by offering us a loan,\" Avelina says. \r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in Erika's house, Avelina wears the orange blouse. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1746978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase vests, sweaters, sweatshirts, and jackets.

Habibu, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to expand his farmland, and hopes to become the most profitable farmer in his community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1635253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T00:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T00:00:14Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habibu ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":13026,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13026}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-16T19:25:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":813263,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":39.59,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To purchase construction materials to renovate the house.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T00:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T00:00:14Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":98000.04,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2017-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8166.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":8166.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":8504.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624781690}],"funded_date":"2014-12-30T20:27:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":813259,"name":"Sunday","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sunday lives in Hoima, Uganda.

She is married and has 7 children, aged 21, 20, 19, 17, 15, 12 and 10. Her business is selling used clothing.  She is a good mother who is cheerful, optimist, happy, and has a good attitude. She is committed to her work and is responsible and hardworking. She does her business in the \u2018Plan 3000\u2019 area. It is colonized by the \u2018Ayoreos\u2019 ethnic group and by miners who have relocated from the western part of the country. It has a warm, tropical and humid climate with a temperature that varies between 18-35 degrees celsius during the day.\r\n  \r\nErika has dark skin, long, black hair she wears tied back, and is of medium stature. Her maternal tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish for business.  She shares her life with her husband, who works in construction, and their children. The three oldest work and the 4 youngest go to school. They live in their own home made of brick. It has potable water and electricity. Wanting to expand her business drove her to make a bank of people with businesses such as selling sandwiches, artisanal items made from plaster, selling beverages, a bookstore, selling fruit, selling tomatoes and making weavings. This was so that they could ask for a loan and prosper in their businesses. Her business is selling used clothing such as jeans and women's blouses. The clothing she offers varies in color, texture, design, etc. She sells in the street under an umbrella where she hangs some items, while she displays others on a table. She does this work every day of the week from 9 a.m. until 7 in the evening. \u201cYou have to be very careful when you are showing what you offer. You can't ignore details. You have to do it as if you were going to show it to the most important producer or customer...\", she says. Her dream is to have her own store where she can sell under a roof. She wants to make an investment in her business through buying used clothing wholesale to lower costs and meet her customers' demands for the season. This is her second loan cycle with the institution in 5 years that she has been doing this activity.  \r\n\r\nThat is why Erika is asking for a loan to buy used clothing wholesale to meet her

Administration. Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Majnun, a graduate of Aga Khan Lyceum in Khorog, Tajikistan. Upon passing my final examinations as a school leaver, I set a goal to pursue a career in the field of Business Administration. It has been a part of my plans since I became aware of the role and function of the economy in a country\u2019s prosperity. \r\n\r\nTajikistan was the poorest republic of the Soviet Union and is now the poorest country in Central Asia. At present, the youth of Tajikistan are trying to get good educations in foreign countries and then return and support their own country. I am one of them; I care not just about my family and my relatives, but also my country. \r\n\r\nI have a big family of five: my parents, me and two brothers. My father worked as an Instructor at school, but currently is unemployed due to the expiration of contract terms; he is looking for a new job. My mother has always worked as a doctor at the local polyclinic, which is her second home. My elder brother is a university student and my youngest one is a school-boy. Although my family\u2019s income is not so much, my parents have always tried to support us as much as possible, but I know it will not be sufficient to cover my university tuition fee.\r\n\r\nI was a diligent student at school and even won the President Grant in 11th grade; my parents were so proud of me. That grant is given to the school-children who had good academic performances and the best extra-curricular activities in school life. \r\n\r\nSo, now I dream of getting a high quality education at the most prestigious university in Central Asia. AUCA is the place where I can improve my skills and gain sufficient knowledge in the area I wish to pursue.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1754947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

During harvest time the inhabitants who work at the factory start their day at 4 am. The group chose their name because they consider themselves independent people since they work in jobs that offer them freedom and earnings to support their families. The members of the group are: Teresa \u2013 Handcrafts and costume jewelry, Karem - sale of women's clothing, Pablo - sale of grocery store items, Laura - sale of perfumes and laminated gold, Francisco -Carpentry, Rogelio -Sale of food and tacos, Juana -Sale of silver and bags. Teresa is 44 years old and is married to Humberto. They have a 17 year old daughter and a 16 year old son. Humberto works as a driver and she works as a doctor's assistant. Two years ago Teresa took a class offered by the government where she learned how to make painted bags and bags embroidered with laces. Later she took another class of costume jewelry where she learned to make bracelets, necklaces, earrings, which she sells to acquaintances. Showing her enthusiasm and participation, recently Teresa also participated at a baking course, and now she also works making cakes that she sells only by order. Teresa is happy with her activities and supported by her family, because they know how to work as a team. Many times her husband as well as her children support her in selling her products by offering them in the places where they socialize. Currently, Teresa needs a loan to buy thread, blanket, paint, glass stones in different colors and pins fro earrings, which is the material she does not have at the moment. Forming part of the group and VisionFund's opportunity motivates Teresa even more to continue with her job. With her earnings and her husband's salary, she wants to keep on supporting her children so they finish their education in the best manner. Professionally she commented: \"I hope to be able to open a small bakery at home, because in a year I will stop working with the doctor and I will have the whole time to be at home producing income\u201d.\r\n*The photograph was taken at Francisco's house.

They are part of the Mazahua indigenous community but they have been gradually losing their culture. In fact, Raquel and Maricela do not speak the language of their parents and Emma has forgotten some words due to lack of practice. \r\n\r\nRaquel is 30 years old. She is married to Juan who is also a merchant. Together they have formed a household with two children, Brayan who is studying in elementary school and little Camila who is still too young for school. Eight years ago, Raquel and her husband began selling clothes. Raquel says: \u201cBrayan already existed in our lives, that is why we needed to have a secure income to meet his needs.\u201d Juan already had sales experience from when he was young thanks to his father. When the couple began, they could not invest too much in foods and did not have a stable store because the rents were very high. How little their earned was not enough to cover this expense. \r\n\r\nRaquel says that, thank to their effort and dedication but especially the support of VisionFund, they now have a stable home in a busy municipality that helps them have good sales. Raquel travels with Emma, her mother-in-law, everyday to get to where they have their store.\r\n\r\nThe three members of the group are very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva because their loan will help them have more merchandise sales to take advantage of this time of year. Specifically, Raquel can buy jackets and pants as the winter has come to Mexico and this type of clothing is sold very well. Maricela will buy more shoes to sell and Emma will buy fabrics and threads.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the park of their municipality.

Tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada desde hace 15 con Jacinto quien se dedica a la construcci\u00f3n de casas y juntos han formado una familia con 2 hijos que actualmente se encuentran estudiando. \n\nHace cuatro a\u00f1os Alejandra comenz\u00f3 a rentar un peque\u00f1o molino de nixtamal, su negocio marchaba muy bien y ten\u00eda un buen n\u00famero de clientes, pero ellos mismos comenzaron a preguntarle si vend\u00eda productos de abarrotes como leche, pan, huevo az\u00facar, caf\u00e9 para preparar el desayuno de sus familias y as\u00ed naci\u00f3 la idea de abrir una tienda. Con las ganancias del molino adquiri\u00f3 los productos de abarrotes m\u00e1s esenciales y una de sus hermanas le ofreci\u00f3 un espacio en su casa para adecuarlo como tienda. Alejandra crey\u00f3 que la ayuda era una buena opci\u00f3n ya que estar\u00eda m\u00e1s cerca de la carretera central. Al final, la ubicaci\u00f3n influy\u00f3 mucho en el crecimiento del negocio por el n\u00famero de ventas.

Cuando viaja en el autob\u00fas es muy inc\u00f3modo porque lleva varias cajas pesadas, pero es m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mico pagar $13 pesos (US$1.00) que viajar en un taxi especial que cobra $120 pesos (US$9.00). Por lo anterior, uno de sus sue\u00f1os es comprar una camioneta para mover su mercanc\u00eda sin ning\u00fan problema, aunque tambi\u00e9n comenta que le hace falta un refrigerador m\u00e1s grande para los l\u00e1cteos o carnes fr\u00edas que vende porque por el momento utiliza el de su casa y es muy peque\u00f1o.\n\nElla y el resto del grupo est\u00e1n muy agradecidos con VisionFund y KIVA porque con sus pr\u00e9stamos podr\u00e1n invertir en sus negocios: Andrea y Luc\u00eda, en sus borreguitos; Mar\u00eda Luisa, en la venta de ropa y Alejandra podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s productos como pan, huevo, leche, productos l\u00e1cteos, refrescos, detergentes etc. para abastecer su tienda de abarrotes.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda se tom\u00f3 en las escaleras del kiosko en el municipio donde viven las integrantes.

The women love to live in their community because they say it is very tranquil and the majority of the population is very friendly. \r\n\r\nAlejandra is a young mother with clear aspirations in her life, and is smiley, friendly, and is always in the best spirits to help when someone requests it. She is 33 years old, and had been married for 15 years to Jacinto who makes a living constructing house and together they have formed a family with two children who are of school age. \r\n\r\nFour years ago, Alejandra began to rent a small hominy mill. Her business goes very well, and she has a good number of customers but some asked if she would sell grocery products like milk, bread, eggs, sugar, and coffee in order to prepare breakfast for their families and this is what gave birth to the idea to open a shop. With the profits from the mill, she bought the most essential grocery products and one of her sisters offered a space in her house to serve as a shop. Alejandra believed that this offer was a good option because it was near a major highway. Finally, the location influenced the growth of the business due to the number of sales. Everyday Alejandra opens the shop at 6:00 am, and spends the day there until 11:00 at night; she dedicates much of her time to her business because there are people who need her services all of the time.\r\n\r\nAlejandra says that the only challenge is the transporting of her merchandise from the town, where she buys all of her things, to her house. When she travels in a bus it is very inconvenient because she has to carry various heavy boxes, but it is more economical to pay $13 pesos ($1.00USD) than to travel in a special taxi that charges $120 pesos ($9.00USD). Because of the aforementioned, one of her dreams is to buy a pick-up truck to move her merchandise without a problem, although she also comments that she lacks a larger refrigerator for her milk and cold meats because for the time being she uses the one in her house and it is very small.\r\n\r\nShe and the rest of the group are very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva because with their loans they can invest in their businesses: Andrea and Luc\u00eda,  in their sheep; Mar\u00eda Luisa, in her clothing sales, and Alejandra will be able to buy more products like bread, eggs, milk, dairy products, sodas, detergents, etc. in order to stock her grocery store. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken on the steps of the gazebo in the town where the partners live.

Here is her story:<br \/><br \/>\u201cNowadays, living is very hard without higher education. In Kyrgyzstan you can\u2019t find a good job if you don\u2019t have a higher education and diploma. It\u2019s unusual for our employers to give a job place to a person, just according to her\/his possibility or skills as in America, where a lot of famous people even without higher education could be who they are now. So, understanding that I live in Kyrgyzstan, I dreamed of getting a degree in European Studies at college.<br \/><br \/>Since my school years I was wondering why European and Asian people are so different. We have different way of life, culture, cuisine. We loved to listen to our teachers while they told us of their trips to other countries and adventures they had. I wished I could also go, explore and feel those emotions. That\u2019s why I did not need time to think what I would study; I knew that I had to enter college. My college has prominent foreign teachers, international atmosphere, where staff and students are like one big family. I had a chance to be a member of it while studying at the New Generation Academy at my college last year, when I won a full scholarship for one-year-study. I met a lot of friends from various countries, had memorable events out of class and a unique spirit with my classmates. <br \/><br \/>My studies as an undergraduate student brought much headache to my parents as they don\u2019t have enough money for my tuition. They are school-teachers; they are budgetary organizations\u2019 workers with a low salary. We also have land and we grow cotton, sunflower, corn and vegetables there. Of course, this income doesn\u2019t allow me and my brothers to buy what we want or study where we want. Because, the work in the field is a seasonal work and depends on other circumstances. <br \/><br \/>I am thankful for Kiva to giving us such a chance to get a loan for my studies and my family waits for your mercy.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1755011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Abdurasul.  He is 33 years old and he works as a taxi driver along a transportation route.  He is also married and the father of three children.  His wife is a homemaker, so Abdurasul is the family's only breadwinner.  Abdurasul has a brother who doesn't have a job at the moment.  He wants to take a loan in order to buy a minivan for his brother, so that his brother will also have a job and will be able to make a living.

To date, Elvira needs PhP 30,000 to buy additional cavans of rice and sugar which she repacks and sells in retail to customers in her community.

life was a story of perennial migration due to livelihood conditions. Born in Pasay, Manila, Marissa and her family went back to Leyte when her father lost his job. As conditions were also difficult in the province, Marissa had to work as a house helper in an aunt in Caloocan. With diligence and hard work, Marissa was able to finish college and began working in a known paper company in Manila. There, Marissa met her husband and started to build her own family. As it was also difficult for her and her husband to have a stable job in Manila, they decided to try transferring to Cavite where there are factories that might absorb them for employment.\n\nIn Cavite, and at that point in time, Marissa decided to break the cycle of migrating in search for better income opportunities. She initially set up a small store in her house and sold in-demand commodities in the community.  In 2013, Marissa availed a loan from SEED which she used to start up a bed-spacing business. From where Marissa lives, factories abound and she knows that like her and her family, there is a big market of workers living outside Cavite who works in the area due to employment potentials. She used her first loan to construct bunker beds for bed-space rentals.\n\nOn her 6th loan now, Marissa wants to avail a PhP 30,000 loan which she will use to repair her store and renovate her bed-space rooms which are for rent. If repairs are done, her store will be more secured and would have better display shelves. On the other hand, her 6 rooms for rent will become 9 after the renovation. All in all, these would provide Marissa with increased incomes and her family a stable and better

Peter\u2019s family, for instance, is often forced to stay in the dark whenever there is a shortage of kerosene in the market. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which partnered with Micro Energy Credits to start a clean energy programme, Peter is seeking a loan to pay for a Pro 2 Solar lantern that will guarantee him a 100% saving on Kerosene. The new lamp has adjustable brightness that makes it possible for the lamp\u2019s application to range from being a desk light for his children to complete homework, to a torch for patrolling his farmland at night. You can help Peter transform his livelihood by lending him a small amount of money that will enabling him to quit using a kerosene lamp that emits more toxins than light and go for an environmentally friendly source of lighting that his kids will enjoy using.

as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift valley region of Kenya.\r\n\r\nMiriam is happily married and, together with her husband, blessed with three lovely children. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Miriam has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.\r\n\r\nAlthough she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up: \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said.\r\n\r\nMiriam mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike.\r\n\r\nMiriam is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge leading to her suffering many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Miriam is going to achieve her dream and goals.\r\n\r\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Miriam feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Miriam will never again suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, leading to increased income level.\r\n\r\nMiriam is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping with farm work. With your loan, Miriam will improve her living conditions and assure a secure future for her children and grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1755053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to transport produce to the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.68,"local_amount":9660.24,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":9851.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824560},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":5629.5,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5741.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264811},{"amount":61.84,"local_amount":5600.92,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5711.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.17,"payment_id":681377879},{"amount":428.86,"local_amount":39109.34,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":39884.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.12,"payment_id":696587545}],"funded_date":"2014-12-29T03:14:17Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":813347,"name":"Eudia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eudia is a rural farmer in Eldoret, Kenya, which is an area known for producing long-distance runners who have broken major world records. Eudia is blessed with three children, and has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years.\r\n\r\nOn her farm, she grows maize and keeps a dairy cow, as well as poultry. She sells milk, eggs and maize, and, when she is not farming, Eudia offers transportation services to other farmers on her motorcycle.\r\n\r\nTo meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she also often engages in a small personal business to make extra money. Farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite the low earnings. Eudia has said, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\"\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Eudia formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow that she later named Mrembo (Swahili for beautiful), which produces milk daily that Eudia sells to a co-operative. \"The money from milk comes regularly and is not really affected by sudden changes in the weather, if you have stored feed,\" said Eudia.\r\n\r\nThe money Eudia earned from selling her milk was sufficient to repay her last loan. Today she is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Eudia is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, with good health and a good livelihood."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":420.33,"image":{"id":1755055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.7,"local_amount":6906.42,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7043.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824562},{"amount":67.87,"local_amount":6033.18,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6152.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264812},{"amount":73.57,"local_amount":6539.68,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6669.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459460},{"amount":75.62,"local_amount":6896.06,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":7032.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.96,"payment_id":696587546},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":3548.73,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.35,"payment_id":731022670},{"amount":81.38,"local_amount":7438.85,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7586.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.31,"payment_id":752110875}],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T13:29:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":813349,"name":"Caroline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders.

She is based in Eldoret: a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married and, together with her husband, has two lovely children. Her primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nHellen is a tough woman with tough skin and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling. The Eldoret area has conditions that favor dairy farming and Hellen has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow but the lack of capital has prevented her.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow. The dairy cow she intends to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a breed that produces between 10-20 liters of milk a day. With this cow, she will produce more milk, which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Eldoret area is high but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Hellen is going to reap more income and comfortably meet the demand.\r\n\r\nHer increased income will allow her to provide a secure future for her school-going children by paying their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success. Her vision is to keep even more dairy cows so that she will be able to build a bio-gas digester, which would help her to save more energy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":387.35,"image":{"id":1755062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality exotic breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.75,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.15,"local_amount":2324.43,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2370.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824566},{"amount":34.26,"local_amount":3045.74,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3106.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262668},{"amount":33.61,"local_amount":2987.95,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3047.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264814},{"amount":44.46,"local_amount":3951.97,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4030.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601005},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":3217.73,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3281.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459462},{"amount":37.32,"local_amount":3380.16,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3447.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.71,"payment_id":681377881},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":3260.31,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3324.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":696587548},{"amount":37.77,"local_amount":3548.35,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3618.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.15,"payment_id":711505858},{"amount":38.02,"local_amount":3499.08,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3568.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.34,"payment_id":731022672},{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":5216.35,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5319.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.62,"payment_id":752110877}],"funded_date":"2014-12-15T19:28:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":813351,"name":"Chopsticks Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malea is the featured borrower of Chopsticks group.

I had a lot of new experiences which changed my view on life. This Program allowed me to explore other nations\u2019 customs, cultures and mentalities. From my point of view, the USA\u2019s multiplicity of nationalities created a new, strong passion in me to explore the varieties of relations of individuals, so that is how I came up with my future major: Sociology.\r\n\r\nA sociology degree is a great foundation for many occupations such as social work, teaching, journalism, management and research. Through studying it one can expand his or her skillsets such as report writing, presentations and group work. Also she\/he will have the opportunity to volunteer, to reflect on any paid work and to be involved in real research projects. AUCA\u2019s staff and students always work on different projects and do research, which can be interesting and useful for me.\r\n\r\nDue to my family\u2019s limited income, they are not able to provide the necessary finances for my education.

El abono es producido por sus lombrices, actividad conocida como lumbricaria, que consiste en alimentar a los peque\u00f1os animales \u00fanicamente con desperdicios org\u00e1nicos como fruta y verdura y as\u00ed las lombrices transforman ese alimento en residuos. El abono resultante se puede aprovechar en cualquier tipo de cultivo lo que otorga grandes beneficios a los productos ya que es m\u00e1s saludable y no es da\u00f1ino con el medio ambiente a diferencia de los fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos. \n\nDo\u00f1a Domi ha practicado la lumbricaria durante 14 a\u00f1os y la inici\u00f3 con ayuda de un ingeniero agr\u00f3nomo quien la capacit\u00f3, en el curso le prestaron las lombrices y medio a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s ella ten\u00eda ya sus propios animales. \n\nAdem\u00e1s, Domitila tambipen vend\u00eda ra\u00edces de flores como el alcatraz amarillo, que ofrec\u00eda en los mercados, despu\u00e9s conoci\u00f3 a un cliente que le compr\u00f3 todas las ra\u00edces que ten\u00eda en ese momento y con las ganancias pudo iniciar su primer invernadero donde cultiv\u00f3 m\u00e1s tipos de bulbos.

Domi tambi\u00e9n ha recibido y aprovechado cursos de dise\u00f1o floral para ganar m\u00e1s clientes: siempre la contratan para los mejores eventos de la comunidad o incluso de otros lugares. \n\nDo\u00f1a Domi tambi\u00e9n se dedica al cultivo de haba, jitomate, nopales, duraznos y por el momento necesita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar rollos de pl\u00e1stico que emplear\u00e1 en la lumbricaria ya que necesita cambiar las protecciones que se encuentran en malas condiciones.

Domi, as she is lovingly called, is 49 years old, married to Juan and their children are all independent.\r\n\r\nProduction of organic fertilizer is one of Domi's strongest businesses, and she sells two types: liquid and solid.  The fertilizer is produced by the worms that are fed organic waste such as fruit and vegetables.  The fertilizer can be used on any type of crop since it is healthier and less harmful than chemical products.\r\n\r\nDomi has been raising worms for 14 years and she started out with the help of an agronomy engineer who trained her.  She was given the worms during the course and six months later she had raised her own.\r\n\r\nDomitila also sells flower roots such as \"alcatraz amarillo\" (Zantedeschia elliottiana) at the markets.  With the profit she made from sales of all her roots to a customer she was able to set up the greenhouse where she grows other bulbs.  Now she also uses flowers to create arrangements for special events.  Domi has taken courses in floral design to attract more customers and she always has contracts for the best events in the community and other places.\r\n\r\nDomi also grows broad beans, tomatoes, prickly pears, pears and is in need of a loan to buy rolls of plastic to cover her worm farm because the current protection is in disrepair.  She is very proud of using the fertilizer she produces which guarantees a quality crop.  \"To obtain benefits from nature we must appreciate it and know how to love it.\", says Domi.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful to VisionFund for helping grow her business.  Without their help her children could not have finished their university studies.  Domi continues with her dream of all producers making their own fertilizer so as not to pollute the earth more.  She also would like to have a well-equipped truck one day to make deliveries because now the one she has is small and old.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken of her worm farm just as Domi was removing waste to see how many worms had reproduced."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1748314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy two rolls of plastic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Lorenzo Toxico, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3485.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3640.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3828.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4046.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":266.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.74},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":255.6,"local_amount":3485.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T16:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3560.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595349948},{"amount":266.98,"local_amount":3640.58,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3718.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980662},{"amount":571.23,"local_amount":7873.92,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.19,"payment_id":624423815}],"funded_date":"2014-12-15T16:37:24Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":813369,"name":"Ponciano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ponciano is a fisherman from Iloilo, Philippines.

They are Mar\u00eda Luisa, Isabel and Alma Rosy who are also relatives.  The fouth member, Sof\u00eda, is a neighbor and friend of the artisans and she raises pigs.\r\n\r\nLuisa, 57, is married to Nicasio and they have seven children who are all independent.  Now, Luisa and Nicasio enjoy the love of their 11 grandchildren.\r\n\r\nIn the community where they live there used to be many artisans like Nicasio who learned to make silver filigree jewelry when he was an adolescent.  Over time he developed his skill and decided to establish a family.  The business was fundamental for covering household expenses and educating his children.  Luisa soon learned to make her own earrings and began her craft career.  She worked more and more helping her husband create jewelry or sold the crafts door-to-door.  Later on their children would also participate in the family business and go to large exhibits and trade fairs throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe Artisans work quite a bit on an order basis, spending more time in the workshop.  They are very grateful for the support from VisionFund because it has allowed them to buy silver in large quantities or work tools.  The family still dreams of having a large craft shop to exhibit their creations and they are sure that with the financial help and hard work they will turn their dream into reality.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the workshop.

In this way, he could now own a new pump boat that serves as the means to transport his catch and also improve his method of fishing. In addition he will also be able to raise and sell pigs.

They work in a variety of jobs such as sales, services, and food sales among other activities. \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Gabriela. She is 26 years old and is in a common-law marriage in which she has one 7-year-old daughter who is in school. Her husband is a master welder.\r\n\r\nGabriela, to get her own income and with this help her husband with the household expenses and with her little one's schooling, works in sales. She sells clothing of all sorts and her manner of sales is door-to-door. She goes out every day for about three hours daily, taking advantage of the morning hours since at this time her daughter is in school and it is easier to make her rounds. She leaves the items on credit and collects every week.

It is around 80 kilometers away from the district headquarters, Nuapada. This village is divided into two hamlets. Darlipada is one of them. All inhabitants of Darlipada belong to the weaver community. Their main source of income is weaving of saris and selling, either in the market or to the traders. \r\n\r\nWeavers always need money for purchasing of yarn so that their weaving will continue. Sometimes, due to lack of finance, they have to stop their work for some days and they incur losses due to this. Women play a vital role in processing of yarn and weaving of saris. \r\n\r\nIn the year 2014, to carry on their weaving, ten women entrepreneurs from this hamlet stepped out and decided to build a secure future for their families with their financial contributions. They formed a self-help group named Harishankar to avail credit from Mahashakti Foundation for development of their existing businesses. \r\n\r\nDalimba is one of the group members and she is standing with her hand raised in the photo. She is 40 years old and lives with her husband, three daughters of 22, 20 and 18 years and one son of 26 years, who helps in her business.\r\n \r\nDalimba is running a hand-loom unit in her house for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader 20 km away from their village. She gets 80 to 100 pieces of sari from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000 to 15,000 rupees (INR). Dalimba does the initial processing of the yarn to make it ready for weaving and after that, her husband fits it to the hand loom and weaves the sari. They only weave saris because of the demand in the market. Her family works around 8 to 10 hours a day and weaves two pieces of sari from it. \r\n\r\nDalimba sells her products to the local traders on a weekly basis. She earns a monthly income of INR 5,000, which is not sufficient to maintain her six-member family along with business investment. So it is high time for her to increase the income for smooth management of her family. \r\n\r\nNow her son is also grown up and has the ability to manage another hand-loom unit. Therefore, from the present loan, Dalimba wants to buy another  hand-loom unit and procure thread\/yarn in bulk for continuous weaving. Purchasing more stock at a time will help her to reduce the purchasing and transportation costs. Dalimba wishes to grow her business and save enough to construct a house and plan for the marriage of her son and daughters. \r\n\r\nOut of the other nine members, seven members have also weaving businesses and two have cloth businesses. These members also want to invest their loans for the development of their enterprises.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1755135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay for purchasing of another hand-loom unit and procure thread\/yarn in bulk for continuous weaving.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"RISIGAON, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belamati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalimba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gangadei ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mithila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pushpanjali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ratne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sambari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taruni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":220000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":220000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T18:19:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":813434,"name":"Waridi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Waridi is so glad to know how Kiva lenders helped him with his rice cultivation.<br \/><br \/>He paid his loan in full and on time.

At a young age, Ruchelle left the province and migrated to Cavite in her cousin's place to try her luck in employment. Ruchelle landed on various odd jobs until her marriage, which had her going back to her roots - farming. With his husband, Ruchelle contributes to the family income by helping her husband in swamp cabbage farming. This has been their primary source of income for 5 years now. \n\nSwamp cabbage farming requires proper soil preparation. As this vegetable grows in swampy areas, this entails ensuring that the land is watered constantly and that the soil is kept in a muddy state. Once the soil has been properly prepared, seeds or cuttings are planted by at least 6 inches apart and 6 inches deep. Ruchelle also ensures quality of the vegetable by adding in natural fertilizers from animal manure. Harvesting takes place after 1 to 2 months of planting. Ideally, the plant is cut from the stem at least 2 inches above the soil line in order to regenerate and grow new shoots. Swamp cabbages are vegetables that grow all year round with proper watering of the soil. With this process, Ruchelle's only investment is the rental of the land that they are farming. With a size of half hectare, Ruchelle pays the land lord PhP 193 per month while her gross sales is at PhP 2,500 per month. \n\nWith due diligence in payment and savings, Ruchelle was able to buy a second hand tricycle which they use in the delivery of the harvested swamp cabbage to the nearby market. On the side, the tricycle is also being used to add up income to the family by servicing students going to and from the school.  On her 7th loan cycle now and with her business doing good, Ruchelle plans to expand the farm lot she and her husband is tending. They wanted to avail another half hectare for farming of the same vegetable. This would require them PhP 20,000 which would cover ental deposit and advance for the said farm lot. With this, Ruchelle will be able to double her sales and income.\n\nRuchelle dreams of buying their own farm lot and providing her four children a better future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1757197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Ibrahim hopes that in the future, he will be able to stay in the same business. \r\n\r\nIbrahim is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Ibrahim who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":674.67,"image":{"id":1755220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more sacks of maize flour and beans for sale,","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Nakaloke","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":49.45,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":141027},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":146121},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":151398},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":156866},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":162531},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":168401},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":174483},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":180784},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":187313},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":194078},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.13,"local_amount":208350,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-26T10:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":214860.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612146526},{"amount":103.93,"local_amount":277139,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-31T11:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":285799.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":626569612},{"amount":54.8,"local_amount":146121,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-28T11:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":150687.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637611027},{"amount":56.77,"local_amount":151398,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":156129.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649529687},{"amount":55.21,"local_amount":156866,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-20T12:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":161768.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.61,"payment_id":666181380},{"amount":55.62,"local_amount":162531,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":167610.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.33,"payment_id":681308340},{"amount":53.97,"local_amount":168401,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":173663.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.18,"payment_id":696518034},{"amount":53.96,"local_amount":174483,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":179935.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.47,"payment_id":711428257},{"amount":49.35,"local_amount":159747,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":164739.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.56,"payment_id":730951005},{"amount":63.48,"local_amount":194078,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-21T13:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":200142.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.3,"payment_id":752041903}],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T03:50:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":813464,"name":"Ranil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ranil engages in raising and selling hogs.
