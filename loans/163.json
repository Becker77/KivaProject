The distribution of farming inputs such as fertilizer and seed is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which also includes training, credit, and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith the income from maize sales, Moses will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Luzanaka group will each plant maize plots between one half and one acre of land. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":917325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-23T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokolastica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micheal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":85400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":85400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":87685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680905}],"funded_date":"2011-12-27T05:30:42Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":364380,"name":"Bassem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bassem is a 51-year-old Lebanese man.

She learnt and got to know this trade while she was in the capital working for her older siblings' company which sells these sorts of things.  The support it has brought her husband and kids has been vital, and her kids have been able to go to university in their home town.  She started this business from a small room and served people from the window.  Little by little the business has grown and she now has lots of clients near where she lives.  She now has a very organized room with display cabinets, and she would like a freezer now too so that she can sell ice creams, lollies and cold drinks.  This means that she would be able to offer a better service to all her clients.  In order to do this she needs a loan of $325 which she will repay in 6 months.

At her bar she serves beer, sodas and spirits. Bars are much more than drinking establishments. They are places for people to gather and visit. Most villages will have one bar. Often the beer is made in-house. Beer is made with millet, sorghum or bananas, with yeast added to the first two versions but not to the bananas.

One could say that there is quite a lot of competition but the group members fight daily to get the income they need to support their homes.  This is why they need a loan, in order to acquire more goods at wholesale, in order to lower their prices and generate a better profit.

She lives in the development of La Playa, which is near the sea where many residents go to fish.  Daly Flor primarily sells cold cuts and sausages made of chicken and pork.  She also sells soft drinks.  This is her sixth loan and she wants to buy a large volume of processed meats and cases of soft drinks.  She experiences high turnover on the weekends, so she goes through her inventory very quickly.  Like many businesses near her, she needs to attract new customers to continue making sales.  Daly Flor started her business nine years ago when she began selling processed meats by taking orders.  Through her business, she got to know many people and began selling gold jewelry with them for a period of two years.  When the price of gold went up and no longer generated profitable returns, she returned to selling processed meats with greater enthusiasm.  From that moment, she joined a solidarity group with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has managed to repay her loans promptly.  \r\n<p>\r\nDaly Flor is an esteemed woman who has succeeded in raising her children and running her business.  She has never lacked anything because she invested her loans in her business and generated good earnings to cover her expenses and support her family.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to move to a different residence because she is affected by heavy rains during the wet season.  Another goal she has is to acquire a cooler so that she can store more processed meats and increase her inventory.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Looc, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: a bakery, a general store and a hog raising businesses. Her husband Danilo N., who is 59 years old, works as a baker to earn his living. They have 6 children who are between 18 to 35 years old. 4 of their children are married and 2 are currently going to school. Cynthia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cynthia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. A previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to pay for more additional working capital for the business so that she could continue to save up for future to support the expenses of the family. Cynthia N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The couple provide for the household together. To meet her needs and provide for her children, Jacqueline has run a business selling escargot in her area for six years. Secondarily, she also prepares and sells 'akassa' (a local paste made from cornstarch) in her area. Jacqueline buys her products in Benin. This first loan will certainly allow her and the other members of the Nounagnon Adjadji Bata group to raise the level of their business and increase their clientele and income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":818803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy 8 sets of 40 snails and one bag of maize.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Genevi\u00e8ve","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00e8wanoussi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Hounm\u00e8 Sossi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"C\u00e9lestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u00e8dotind\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sidonie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u00e9onie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Viviane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Henriette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":530000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75800},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":328.94,"local_amount":151600,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":152422.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226977878},{"amount":164.48,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232737260},{"amount":164.47,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238541972},{"amount":164.47,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244501598},{"amount":164.47,"local_amount":75800,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":76211.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251061947},{"amount":163.17,"local_amount":75200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-20T08:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":75607.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257112163}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T20:07:33Z","paid_date":"2012-02-20T08:43:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":323385,"name":"Dionicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMARIA ELENA MOYANO\u201d; el banco se encuentra ubicado en el Distrito de Huanchac en la Provincia de Cusco y Departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

Y. is 55 and married.

There are 11 members in his family, and the costs are going to be increasing day by day. Besides these problems, his father has a serious illness and Y. must treat him because he doesn't have other brothers to take this responsibility. These hard problems definitely made a big headache for him, and he didn\u2019t know how to find solution for it. After thinking deeply, he decided to buy more livestock and increase his income through them. He hopes that this decision may give a positive result. He has applied for a loan of 50,000 Afghanis from AFSG for 24 months.\r\n<p>\r\nY. hopes to eradicate the barriers of the problems as soon as possible and then treat his sick father.

M. is from the town of Catarman, Camiguin Province.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Delia has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Delia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional working capital. Delia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Delia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Juliet has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juliet joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juliet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients for her food products. Juliet is requesting a loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase more raw ingredients needed to make her food products. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Juliet from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

what Gloria S., 60, does to make the most out of her life. At 60, Gloria has already lost her life partner. She currently lives with her children and young grandchildren in Silang, Cavite. Gloria finds fellowship and entrepreneurial training in CCT*, where she is one of thousands of Community partners.\r\n\r\nGloria is a fruit and vegetable dealer. She primarily sells tropical fruits like mangoes and pineapples, as well as fresh vegetables for every-day meals. Gloria's commercial space is located in another municipality; while she lives in Silang, her store is located in Kawit (still in Cavite). Monthly she earns a net income of Php5,400. \r\n\r\nDue to previous financial struggles,  Gloria decided to request a loan of Php10,000 to help her grow her business. She will use this to purchase more fruit and vegetables to add to the array of goods in her store. Gloria will only pick the freshest produce to sell to her valued customers. Gloria says that this loan will impact greatly on her business capital.\r\n\r\nAt present, one struggle she has is the long lists of debts accrued by some of her customers. Gloria will make use of her 38 years of experience in the business to solve this issue. She aims to improve her business and include more products to sell. Above all, she hopes that her children will be successful and that her grandchildren will finish their education.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":729423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Bulk purchase of food and household goods; transportation to market; rental of shop or market stall for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Ker Gu Mag","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11167,"name":"In\u00e9s","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Ines has owned her clothing store for twenty years.

She did that for a period of time, marketing her items mainly to friends and family, as well as local neighborhoods where she knew most of the people.<\/p>\r\n<p> This 37 year-old entrepreneur has four children, all of whom still live with her. Two of the children are working and help Ines financially with necessities for the house. Her husband has been working in a factory for the last 15 years, and whenever Ines has to attend to her children or visit her distributors, her husband is able to watch over the business which is open from 8am until 11pm every day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ines has borrowed from Kiva and Mifex before. She was able to successfully invest her first loan. She saved her extra profits after purchasing a wide variety of products to sell. Shortly afterwards, she opened a new point of sale that is being run by her children. She is very happy about this because it is bringing in extra income for herself and also providing for her children. The new loan she will take out will be invested in new inventory for her two stores.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

With the loan from Kiva, he would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to improve his welfare.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Lucy and her husband are living positively with HIV. Her husband is a soldier while she sells second-hand shoes at Gikomba market.

During previous years, her family life was difficult because she had to send the children to school and borrowing money was not as easy. Since the TYM Fund comes to her region and it has a proper repaying method, Mrs.V. enthusiastically joins it.  The money borrowed is used effectively, and as a result, her family income increases.

After he had retired, the family had borrowed extra loans to invest in expanding his auto repair shop.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Primary School, Bassa Town Group. R.E.C. Primary School Bassa Town was founded in 1945 by the Rural Council to give education to the children of Waterloo. R.E.C. Bassa Town is divided into Lower Primary School (Classes I \u2013 III) and Upper Primary School (Classes IV \u2013 V). The Lower and Upper schools have a total number of 731 pupils and a total number of twelve staff. R.E.C. Primary school is proud that their pupils are able to make good grades at the National Primary School Exams (NPSE).\r\n\r\nOver the years, the school has grown so much that it now lacks adequate classrooms. Staffing is also a problem facing the school. It lacks enough trained and qualified teachers to meet the growing number of pupils.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for teachers of the B.E.C. Primary School from SMT\/Kiva. This loan will certainly be of immense help to these teachers. Since salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone, especially for people in the teaching profession, they could not use their salaries to buy or do anything great. But with a loan, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time. Some of them will use it to begin or continue building a house, others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use it to invest in businesses in order to complement their monthly salaries. Still others will use it to buy furniture.\r\n\r\nIrene M. C. (back row third from left) is the head teacher of R.E.C. Lower Primary School. She was born in Waterloo, twenty miles (thirty-two km) from Freetown. She is fifty years old and married with four children. Two of her children are grown, one is in college and the other is in Junior Secondary School III (JSS III). She has been a head teacher of this school for over five years. Irene will invest this loan in her business. It will enable her to expand her business. She sells cigarettes, sugar, soft drinks, rice and so on. With the loan, she will be able to buy these items in wholesale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":292911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

This is an urban zone on the border of the Castilla district, which belongs to the Piura province in the region of the same name.  It is located three hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor one year she has been selling food as a street vendor.  She sells on a pretty busy street, which is frequented by lots of drivers.  The business enjoys being well received due to its good seasoning and the good customer service.  \r\n\r\nAs demand is growing, a cousin helps her.  The income she gets from this activity is used for her personal expenses and to help support her family.\r\n\r\nNelly wants to expand her business by purchasing more utensils, which will allow her to offer better service.  To do this she has seen the need to ask, for the first time, for a loan for 500 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa.  The loan will help her achieve her objective so that she can get more income and keep growing as a businesswoman.\r\n\r\nShe is a responsible young woman, and she really likes the work she does.  Her greatest desire is to be able to have her own restaurant.  The people who know her consider her to be a dynamic woman who is always ready to help when needed.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":522412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy utensils to improve service and expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Castilla - Piura - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-04-10T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.51,"local_amount":116.28,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":131.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662415},{"amount":32.39,"local_amount":80.98,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":91.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695123},{"amount":33.06,"local_amount":82.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":93.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878168},{"amount":34.51,"local_amount":86.26,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":97.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618197},{"amount":35.49,"local_amount":88.74,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":100.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832597},{"amount":18.04,"local_amount":45.09,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":51.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099203}],"funded_date":"2010-04-11T01:41:13Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":196403,"name":"Ruslan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruslan B. is a 36-year-old trader who sells seasonal vegetables in his small shop in Agsu city.

This amount will be used to buy more quantities of groceries, beverages and other items for the opening of her new variety store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow and that she will be able to buy her own house and lot. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Jovia is 20 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Jovia has been working hard to manage her market stand, which sells fresh fruits. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jovia has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fruit for resale, and will help Jovia to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Jovia hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a home. \r\n\r\nJovia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jovia's future prospects by helping her to learn how to succeed.

This is 50-year-old Farida U. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with five children between the ages of 13 and 25. Farida has been running a poultry business since 1990. \r\n\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for six hours per day, seven days per week. Farida currently earns about US$300 from her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to open another business. Farida thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":271620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This will enable her to get at least 80 litres of milk per day.\n\nShe also desires to add more rental houses to about 30. This will increase her monthly income, hence improve the standard of living of her family.\n\nAbout KADET:\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is committed to economically empowering its clients by providing financial services in order to  relieve suffering and improve living conditions in communities across Kenya.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":372330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying  a dairy cow ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kirigu, Kikuyu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2009-08-20T08:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace Wairimu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T17:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73625374},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T21:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87063273},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T00:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96978161},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103822847},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110714851},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118107023},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123961416},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":4445,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4460.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128976481},{"amount":58.27,"local_amount":4440,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4455.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136702888}],"funded_date":"2009-08-20T14:47:03Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:27:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":134139,"name":"Binta","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Binta D. est une femme de 28 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et a 3 enfants en charge.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The profits from this loan will enable him to pay school fees for his children and pay rent for his business premises.\r\n\r\nIn future, Dionysius plans to venture into a transportation business and, if possible, purchase a Canter (a Mitsubishi light-duty  commercial vehicle) to assist him in transporting cereals to the market. He is asking Juhudi for more funding in the future and asking Jehudi to diversify its loan products to include loans for school fees and top-up loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":564617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To
