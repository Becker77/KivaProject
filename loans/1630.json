Meet Teresa, a mother of three from Eldoret, a remote town in the Rift valley province of Kenya. She has spent the past seven years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in personal business to make ends meet. T\r\n\r\neresa is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her birds. She is so close with her animals that she has nicknamed one of them \u201cKipara,\u201d meaning no feathers on the head. \r\n\r\nTeresa wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan of 30,000 KES which she will use to buy additional poultry. With this loan, Teresa will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money. \r\n\r\nTeresa is very concerned about her child\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay for his school fees. Teresa dreams of a secure future for her children. Teresa awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":287.29,"image":{"id":1755273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is happily married, and together with her husband is blessed with four lovely children. For the past 20 years, she has been practicing mixed farming, and, because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. Income from selling milk, eggs, and maize has allowed her to earn a decent income. Elizabeth passionately loves dairy farming, and animals on her farm have been given names such as Lelmet. Milking and feeding Lelmet (the name of her cow) makes her very proud.\r\n\r\nBy selling milk, she has had good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she receives orders from customers and then sends her customers a text message when the milk is ready for collection. Demand has been overwhelming, and she needs an extra breed of cow to satisfy fully the demand. She is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Elizabeth does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow; she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich, creamy milk. The dairy cow will produce between 15-20 liters of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate into more income, and Elizabeth will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children going to school.

She has a college education and worked as an English-language teacher at a school until her retirement. To provide a source of income for her family, Sanavar got involved in selling children's toys at the beginning of this year. The business started with an initial sum of 50,000 som (KGS), today yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month. This money is not enough for a decent life, supporting the family and helping her children and grandchildren. In order to further develop her business, Sanavar requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy toys in anticipation of the high demand for toys with the upcoming holidays and livestock for her younger daughter. Sanavar is planning to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her business in order to save money for her granddaughter's

She is married to Edelberto, and they have 3 children, of which 2 are in high school and 1 is in elementary school. She manages her household while operating her business. She works hard to augment their income to support  their daily household needs and to send their children to school. \r\n\r\nMaria Ana operates a general store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store that sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of 1000 PHP a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy sacks of rice, charcoal, soda, and other grocery items. She is positive that the loan will boost her income as she expands her business. Maria Ana hopes to maintain and grow her business so she can uplift the lives of her family. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week at which time she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Thanks to Gulzat's and her friendly family's hard work, the business yields a monthly profit in the amount of about 20,000 som (KGS), primarily from selling ecologically-clean and delicious, home-made milk. This is why, in order to further develop her business, Gulzat requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy dairy cows to increase milk sales. Increasing the livestock headcount will allow her to grow the business and increase the family's income.

One day he even dreams of being able to travel abroad to China or Dubai and start a business buying mobile phones in bulk and selling them back in Brazzaville.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8375,"image":{"id":1755407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to open a new phone stand and stock it with phones, SIM cards and phone credit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":8375,"lender_count":282,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":199.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yannick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eveline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortense","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathalie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anasthasie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victorine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabrice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":4410000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":8375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":323700},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":330700},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":338500},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":346600},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":354400},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":362300},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371100},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":379400},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":388000},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":397000},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":406400},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":411900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":614.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":628.03},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":658.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":673.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":688.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":704.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":720.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":736.85},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":771.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":782.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1242.77,"local_amount":654400,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":654713.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610578699},{"amount":1206.55,"local_amount":685100,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":685427.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":94.51,"payment_id":624251114},{"amount":1278.66,"local_amount":716700,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":717042.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":82.42,"payment_id":636253334},{"amount":2162.12,"local_amount":1138500,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1139044.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649588420},{"amount":1525.73,"local_amount":803400,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-21T12:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":803784.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":666509023},{"amount":759.98,"local_amount":411900,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":412097.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.26,"payment_id":681367360}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T21:59:26Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T14:25:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":813605,"name":"Leatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leatu is a maize farmer from Kwankwani village in Kaduna state.

It is quite picturesque with volcanoes on either side. This past March, seven indigenous women, determined to empower themselves and eliminate poverty, formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cAtitecas.\u201d They understood that the organization's \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program, which combines small loans and education, would benefit them greatly. The ladies report that they have paid back their first loan in full. They were pleased to generate additional income, some of which was used for educational expenses for their children.  Dora, who we previously reported on, was happy to share that she was able to maintain and expand her shoe store.\r\n\r\nMercedes, the current Secretary of the Trust Bank, is 33 years of age and has two years of formal education. She has a traditional textile business weaving and embroidering by hand. She is requesting a loan that she plans to use to purchase thread and other supplies. At this time of the year, there are many tourists in the town, and Mercedes wants to have plenty of inventory available. Her dream is to increase sales and raise the standard of living for her family. \r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Trust Bank attend monthly meetings with a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer. Besides making payments on their loans, the women gain personal and business tools that they can immediately use.

She is requesting a new loan that she will use to purchase a supply of various colors of thread, and other supplies, to create beautiful handmade cortes (woven skirts), huipiles (colorful blouses) and fajas (ornate belts). Maria lives with her parents and four siblings, and will use the earnings of her business to help support the family. As she was unable to complete elementary school, she works hard so that her siblings will be able to get a good education.\r\n\r\nMaria is able to gain practical and important information each month at the meeting of the Trust Bank. Using games, drawings and role-playing, a Friendship Bridge Loan Officer shares pertinent information with Maria and her friends in the Trust Bank.  They learn about the world around them and within them, with educational seminars about nutrition, health, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. The women empower themselves with information about their rights as women, self-esteem, and women\u2019s health. They learn to effectively manage their loans with new business tools (accounting, budgeting, marketing, pricing, customer service).\r\n\r\nThanks to Kiva investors and Friendship Bridge, the six women of the \u201cFlor de Tzununa\u201d Trust Bank are stepping into a brighter and more successful future.

His operating expenses will go down, while his crops' yield will increase as he spreads the nutrient-rich fertilizer on his fields. Also, his wife will not inhale toxic smoke anymore while she cooks. \r\n\r\nFurther, the greenhouse gases generated by the waste will not contaminate the atmosphere anymore, as they will be transformed into methane-rich biogas inside the biodigester. With the savings he will make, Bernardino aims at expanding his farm and house.\r\n\r\nBernardino is pictured here on the day his biodigester was installed.

Thanks to Rahat\u2019s hard work at present she has a land plot of 0.16 ha [0.4 acres], where she annual grows potatoes, raspberries and apples for sale. She also has two cows and four sheep. Her monthly revenue ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 KGS. This income is drastically insufficient to maintain a dignified quality of life for Rahat and her children. In order to develop her farm further, Rahat has applied to the Bai Tushum microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 40,000 KGS to buy sheep. Rahat plans to use the resulting revenue for an additional livestock increase.

Shahrituz is in the south-western part of Tajikistan and is one of the warmest places in the republic. \r\n\r\nRuzigul is a wife and the mother of two children. She works with field crop cultivation.

Some years ago Omar decided to move to the city of Santa Cruz, to the house of his aunt and uncle, so that he could study in the program in Public Accounting. His family still lives in their community. His great motivation is to be able to support his family economically and be a successful professional. Since he has scarce resources, this is the reason why he is applying for an educational loan.\r\n\r\nOmar now works as a bookkeeper in an electrical installation business, and he comments to us that in spite of the distance, he has the unconditional support of his family, which drives him to continue forward to reach his dreams.

These better terms are benefits that help him dream of a better future for his children. \r\n\r\nJorge will use this second loan to buy seed potatoes and organic fertilizers in order to grow more crops and later sell them in his local market. This will allow him to earn the income he needs to sustain his family and give them decent living conditions.\r\n\r\nWhat the loan will mean to him is basically to guarantee that he will have a good harvest with all the supplies he needs, so that his customers will have better products. This has been his experience in the past, as previous loans have allowed him to have better harvests.\r\n\r\nOne of Jorge's goals is to build houses for his children to improve their living conditions and also to help them get an education so that they can learn a profession. He would like to continue to work the fertile lands of his community. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1749264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy seed potatoes and organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T22:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T22:40:09Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.13,"local_amount":0.96,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070763},{"amount":0.13,"local_amount":0.94,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":0.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624776983},{"amount":0.45,"local_amount":3.3,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489408},{"amount":0.46,"local_amount":3.35,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664971835},{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":0.15,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":0.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267369},{"amount":273.81,"local_amount":1991.3,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2094.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477305}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T05:48:08Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:14:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

It was all she had hoped for: not just an open door, but what was behind that door. What she found defined what she wanted to be. Gregoria is 50 years old and has big aspirations to succeed in life. She has 3 children who are excellent students in the community school.\r\n\r\nGregoria makes a dignified living as a dressmaker and seamstress in her community, which she has been doing for 8 years. She learned the trade from a wonderful woman who had a clothing production business in the community. She hired her and learned from her, and then decided to start her own such business as it would give her profits to improve her family\u2019s quality of life. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to remodel her home, as the current conditions are not suitable to live in. This is why she decided to request a loan to remodel her home and thus have appropriate conditions for her and her family. One of her dreams is to open a shop in her community center to have higher sales and to give her children an education so that they become working professionals in different fields in their community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1745873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to remodel her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Suchitep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-12-15T22:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-29T22:40:09Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.94,"local_amount":670,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":671.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070753},{"amount":122.59,"local_amount":934,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":935.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624776971},{"amount":87.94,"local_amount":670,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":671.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134277},{"amount":43.97,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":335.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664971822},{"amount":87.94,"local_amount":670,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":671.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267357},{"amount":39.38,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":300.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711384864},{"amount":55.24,"local_amount":421,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":421.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731214999}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T00:25:30Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T12:14:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Fried","image":null}},{"id":813833,"name":"Cissy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cissy is married with two children, who both attend school.

Although there is potential market for her business, finance was a hindrance for her. After intervention of the Mahashakti Foundation in her village, she saw a ray of hope and motivated other women members to borrow from Mahashakti Foundation by forming this group.

Her business is making insoles for shoes.  She's a patient, supportive, strong, responsible, and hardworking woman as well as a good listener and a good mother.\n\nShe works in the 16 de Julio commercial area, known for its traditional street market on Thursdays and Sundays, where you can buy anything from needles for sewing to a tractor for plowing.  The climate is cold and dry, with a temperature that ranges from 2 to 12 degrees centigrade during the day.\n\nDionicia is dark and wears her long black hair in a braid.  (She's seated at the left, wearing a black cap.)  Her native language is Aymara and she speaks Spanish for business.  She lives with her husband, a construction worker, and with her children; the older ones are independent and work, and the youngest daughter attends school.  They live in a rented house that has potable water, electricity, and gas in the home.\n\nHer attitude and desire to improve herself led her to convene a group of people to request a loan and expand their businesses, which include coca leaf sales, quinoa juice sales, empanada production, perfume sales, beverage sales, pollera [traditional skirt] sales, and ice cream sales.\n\nHer business is producing insoles, which she makes in different materials including leather, polyurethane, neoprene, and poron urethane.  The process for making these insoles starts with a thorough exploration of the pattern of the foot.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Maryamu can now store her maize at harvest time and sell it a few months later for up to 40% more than the market price at harvest. When asked, Maryamu  spoke of her  ambition to use the additional income to educate her children, eventually hoping to ensure her children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1631654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for school fees and uniforms, thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-16T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-30T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maryamu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10874,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10874}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-16T02:49:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":813839,"name":"Vailet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vailet, 30 years old, lives in Mundri, South Sudan.

However, because of her schedule and the courses that she is currently taking, it has been hard to work and study at the same time.  For this reason, she is hoping for Kiva's support in order to continue with her studies because given her family's current financial situation it is very difficult to continue affording her education.\r\n\r\nShe is an enterprising young woman who is happy with the career she has chosen because she feels that she has the opportunity to work in different areas of businesses and someday she would like to start her own business, grow professionally and be a more productive member of society so that she can give her family a better quality of life.  She believes that is is essential to support young entrepreneurs so that they can start and finish their education, especially if they are people who are capable and willing to be successful but do not have the resources to do so since paying for a college education requires a huge investment.  For this reason, she is very grateful for Kiva and IPFE who are investing in education, which will doubtlessly produce great results in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":876.67,"image":{"id":1749256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"pay off her remaining debt and continue studying.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":358,"posted_date":"2014-12-16T01:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-30T01:30:06Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Rudy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1936,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1936}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":256.11,"local_amount":254.27,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":256.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595187743},{"amount":285.79,"local_amount":283.74,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":285.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611811611},{"amount":274.98,"local_amount":273.01,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":274.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624256282},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":59.36,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-12-01T13:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":59.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752106574}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T15:54:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Roberto Henry"}},{"id":813851,"name":"Edna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edna is a 50-year-old married woman and a mother of five grown up children from Iloilo, Philippines.

as a challenge in life in order to be able to realize big accomplishments in life. This is the case of Manuel who has had to create a source of income for his family. He is 19 years old, single, and has the desire to be successful in life. He works as a bricklayer in his community, and has been doing this for 3 long years of sacrifice but it has made him very proud because he does what he needs to do to provide income to meet his family's need and for the development of the community in which he lives.<br \/><br \/>The loan will be used to buy construction tools to be used in bricklaying as it is important for him and without these tools he won't be able to continue building in his community. One of the biggest dreams he has is to open his own construction service in his community and the development in the future and building of his own home in order to have adequate living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1749351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to buy construction tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Suchitep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2014-12-16T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-30T02:20:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Single"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":291.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.7,"local_amount":292.5,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T10:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":303.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595070765},{"amount":39.7,"local_amount":292.5,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-21T10:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":303.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":612113722},{"amount":79.45,"local_amount":585.42,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":607.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636134295},{"amount":39.7,"local_amount":292.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":303.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649489412},{"amount":39.7,"local_amount":292.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":303.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664971838},{"amount":39.7,"local_amount":292.5,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":303.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681267373},{"amount":197.05,"local_amount":1452.08,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1507.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696477309}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T13:31:28Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T12:14:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":813860,"name":"Yusuf","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yusuf is a maize farmer and a member of Babban Gona.

When asked, Maitala spoke of his ambition to use the additional income to educate his children; he hopes to eventually make more money for himself and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1628269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for school fees and uniforms, thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-16T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-30T02:30:03Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maitala","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10539,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10539}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-16T15:43:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":809503,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":271.08,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to invest in chain-link, cement posts, and the labor to install a chain-link fence around the edges of her property.

This place is known for its great vegetation, but above all, for its beautiful, sweet water spas that are frequently visited by local tourists, and also those from other cities. \r\nThis is the place where Luz lives. She is 65 years old, she is divorced, and from that relationship she has three children who are adults, and who still live with her. \r\nLuz is a great woman who likes to work to get ahead. She makes a living breeding chickens and Creole hens in a small pen. She buys these animals when they are young and then keeps them for a span of three months, enough time so they have suitable growth to later sell them to others in the neighborhood.

She has been a widow for a few years.  Thanks to her parents' efforts, she was able to complete her secondary schooling.  For financial reasons, however, she wasn't able to study at the university level.  But that hasn't been an obstacle to her success. \r\n<p>\r\nIn spite of everything, Daysi owns a restaurant.  It's work that requires a lot of time and effort.  Daysi puts in a lot of both to get ahead and be successful in life.  She learned the culinary arts from her mother.  She exclusively prepares lunches and snacks.  She also makes typical Spanish dishes, which she learned in the time she lived as a migrant in Spain.  She came back to Ecuador over five years ago.  Thanks to everything she has done, Daysi owns her restaurant outright and has for one year.  \r\n<p>\r\nDaysi's marital status has lead her to live independently for a year and a half.  Her home is in the Gualund\u00fan neighborhood of Latacunga in Cotopaxi Province.  Daysi's business is situated in her home.  This is a beneficial arrangement, as there is a lot of coming and going near her home and she can offer her services to everyone who is constantly traveling through the area. \r\n<p>\r\nDaysi is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making it possible for her to grow in her work life.

He works hard to provide them with the necessary living needs. He has been employed in a tailoring factory since 2004, with fourteen years of experience in this domain, since he used to work with his family in Syria after he had to quit school during his Intermediate level and join the family business.\r\n\r\nHusein is a hard worker who puts so much effort into developing himself and his family's living. His acquired income is a limited monthly salary, which is barely enough to cover their living expenses. Thus, for this reason he thought of starting his own small business, as additional income. To take this step forward, he needs extra capital, which obviously he currently can't afford. That's why he is acquiring a loan from Kiva's field partner Al Majmoua, in order to start his own clothes selling business, to increase his income and develop his family's living, especially before the coming Christmas and New Year seasons. He hopes that in the future, he can buy his own shop, diversify his products and expand his working sector."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1251,"image":{"id":1755897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"To start his own clothes selling business to increase his income and develop his family's living, especially before the coming Christmas and New Year seasons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Saida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.563056 35.368889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2014-12-16T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-30T04:40:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Husein","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130.5,"local_amount":130.5,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":130.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610477195},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T10:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624151720},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636138386},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649775893},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665265439},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681271571},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696481467},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711389880},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730913433},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752004418}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T18:50:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":813903,"name":"Sandra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sandra runs a small sari-sari or variety store business selling various goods and items to the people in her place.

years old. After the divorce, she has started her new life and provided for her children independently. They live together in a small low-roofed house with very limited access to necessary facilities. Mrs. Lom has worked very hard to struggle with the life of deprivation, and in spite of the hardship, she is very optimistic and proud of her daughters because they could attend school fully with good results.\r\n\r\nWithout being trained for work, and because of dropping out of school early, Mrs. Lom can only work at agricultural production.  It is unstable and generates low income, because of the harsh condition of nature, and the lack of access to modern techniques in farming.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For the past five years, Mary has been working hard to manage her produce business in which sells produce like maize flour and beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mary has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more maize flour, rice, and millet flour for sale, and will help Mary to generate greater profits and take good care of her children by providing them with enough food. Mary hopes that in the future she will be able to build more rental houses. \r\n\r\nMary is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

Manta is a city known for its beautiful beaches, which are constantly visited. It is a city of unequalled beauty with many tourist attractions. This group of people decided to start a communal bank, which will be of great help for them. With the loans, they will be able to improve their small businesses. They all have different activities: commerce, food, and services, among other things.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Emerita, who is 47 years old, married and has a 12-year-old daughter who goes to school. Her husband is a businessman. Emerita is a good mother and wife. She wanted to make her own money in order to help her husband with the home expenses and their daughter\u2019s studies. She sells clothes, shoes and Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and women\u2019s accessories). She sells door-to-door, but also at home when her customers visit her. She works in the morning, when the weather is cool and her customers are easier to find. She sells on credit and collects the money every second week.
