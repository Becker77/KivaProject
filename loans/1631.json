She is married to Teofilo, and has two children. One is in high school and the other one is in the elementary level. She manages her household while operating the business. She works hard to provide income to support and meet their daily personal and household needs, and to send her children to school. \r\n\r\nJenilyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a general store is basically a small convenience store which sells fresh, dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all products are essential household items and food. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also has a small tailoring. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum net income of Php 1,000 a day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her general store business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan which she will use to buy more grocery items such as noodles, sacks of rice, charcoal, soda and other grocery stuff. She expects an increased demand of grocery items, especially now that Christmas is fast approaching. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her, and a good return on her investment for it will surely help cover their daily household needs and for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nJenilyn hopes to maintain and grow her business so they could have a better life. She strives hard to give her children the best education possible, and prays for a quiet and happy life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1755768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a good mother, generous, kind, optimistic, happy, responsible, hard-working and has a positive attitude. \r\n\r\nHer business is carried out in the area \u201cplan 3000,\u201d an area characterized by the multiculturalism of its inhabitants.  Immigrants from the west of the country such as relocated miners and native ethnic groups from the place such as the \u201cAyoreos\u201d occupied the area. Their next generation mainly lives from trade, commerce and manufacturing in the whole area.  The climate is warm, tropical and humid, with a constant temperature between 21-35 degrees centigrade all year.\r\n\r\nHeidy  is dark-complexioned, short in stature, with long, black, tied-back hair.  Her mother tongue is Guarani that she shares with her oldest relatives.  In her business she speaks Spanish.  She is the third from the left, in a black blouse with white flowers and a blue skirt.\r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and their children.  The oldest are studying in school and the youngest is in kindergarten.  Her desire to expand her business to generate a better income for her family led to forming a bank of people with businesses such as: the sale of potato chips, the sale of sportswear, neighbourhood store, butcher shop, sale of sandwiches, artisan shop and the sale of soft drinks, in order to ask for a loan and continue with their businesses.\r\n\r\nHer business is the sale of traditional food such as \u201cMajadito de charque\u201d (dried meat, rice, fried egg and fried banana), \u201cCogote relleno\u201d (Creole chicken neck, the stuffing could be potato and chicken liver)  \u201cChicharron de Taitetu\u201d (Mount \u201cTaitetu\u201d fried pork rind), \u201cLocro carretero cruceno\u201d (dried meat, meat cut into pieces, yucca and egg soup), \u201cSopa de Remojado\u201d (bone soup) and others.\r\n\r\nShe works every day of the week in the local marketplace.

Her husband was disappointed with the circumstance and left the family while the other daughter has been married and lived with the in-laws. Despite all of these hardships, Mrs. Thanh loves her disabled daughter with all her heart and works very hard everyday to provide the daughter a good life. Indeed, she works at plenty of agricultural activities, such as cultivating rice, corn, peas, and raising pigs and chickens for a living. She also constantly expands production to improve earnings. To have enough capital for investment, she has taken out loan from the Anh Chi Em Program. This is the fourth time she has received a loan from the Program and she will use it to buy piglets and food for the pigs. She hopes her investment will go well and generate extra income so that she could provide better for her daughter.

resources to pay for the educational expenses of university. She is married and has a 16-year-old son who is studying. Apart from her husband and son, her mom and two siblings live with them. \r\n\r\nMirna worked for 12 years as a secretary in the mayor's office. Nevertheless, they dismissed her 8 years ago, and it had been difficult to find another job because of her age. In addition, her mother had begun to be in bad health and there hadn't been anyone to afford her the care that she needed.

This time is the second time Sabry is applying for a Kiva loan. The first loan was very helpful for him to process more mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payment transactions. Sabry is also known as a trustworthy young man in his neighborhood; thus it makes his shop more favorable to go to when people want to buy mobile phone airtime or pay for utility bills. As the business grows, Sabry hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva to process such transactions. In the photo, Sabry is the one who is standing in front of his small stall.

Wilson is a friendly member of the community with 4 children. Wilson lives with his family in a house made of mud walls, a dirt floor and an iron roof.\n\nKwibancha North village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a local water point. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Wilson\u2019s community need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nWilson has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Wilson volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to educate his community that chlorine improves their health so that they are able to work.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Ugu\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water.

The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. In Ugu, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mildred has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

The schools do not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Meet Chara, a micro-entrepreneur who sells mobile phone airtime credits and serves utility bill payments for his customers. Chara lives in Serang, with three of his family members. Serang is a semi-urban city, located about two hours' drive from Jakarta. Chara is happily married and he and his wife have been blessed with two children.\r\n\r\nChara joined PT Rekan Usaha Mikro Anda (Ruma) about one year ago and he feels glad that he has the opportunity to improve his business. \r\n\r\nThis is the second time Chara has applied for a Kiva loan. The first loan was very helpful to him in processing more mobile phone airtime credits and utility bill payment transactions. Chara has the advantage of selling such products because he is a hard-working person in his neighborhood, thus it makes his shop more favorable to go to when people want to buy mobile phone airtime or pay for utility bills. As the business grows, Chara hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva to process such transactions.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Chara plans to improve the new product he serves, which is an \u2018e-commerce\u2019 for low-income communities \u2013 a new business model from Ruma that is aimed at helping people get access to good quality products with better prices. The products range from fashion products, to housewares and kitchenwares, to gadgets and school supplies. \r\n\r\nTo buy an item, people only have to pick things they want to buy from the product list in the catalog. After that, they can go to Chara or any other certified Ruma agents near their houses to make order and payment.

On average, he is able to make an income of USD 5.00 a day.\r\n\r\nNoeun wants to improve the general living conditions of the entire family by having a latrine to use, because there is no latrine in his house now.

She has 5 children aged 3, 4, 8, 13, and 14.  She has a business selling cakes.  She is a good mother who is enterprising, patient, a good listener, supportive, responsible, and hardworking.  She carries out her business in the \"El Torno\" area, a rural place where there are farmers producing meat, milk, vegetables, grains, etc., and also wholesale distributors who take these products to the various markets in the city.  This place has a warm tropical climate that is very humid.  The temperature during the day varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade over the whole year.  \r\n\r\nArminda has a dark complexion and long black hair.  Her native tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she also speaks Spanish.  She is seated on the right, wearing a blue blouse and holding a black purse.  She lives with her partner, who works in construction, and their children.  Their oldest 3 children attend school, and the 2 youngest ones are in her care.  The family lives in a rented house that has potable water, electricity, and sewer service. \r\n\r\nBecause of her desire to get ahead in order to meet the needs of her children, Arminda formed a communal bank with people that have a variety of businesses, including: food sales, neighborhood store, meat shop, sandwich sales, the knitting of baby clothes, fried potato sales, and sports clothes sales.  They formed a group to request a loan so that they can generate more profits. \r\n\r\nArminda's business is selling cakes, and her specialties include: mandarin cake, cake filled with chocolate ganache and raspberries, cake with lemon, nuts, and peanuts, almond cake for children, cake with dates and nuts, cake with peach and sunflower seeds, orange cake, and cake with yogurt and apples.  \"In order to prepare a cake, the quantities we use in the recipe have to be exact, thus it is important to use a scale, measuring cups, and measuring spoons...\" she comments.

She is married with five children aged between 7 and 18 years, all of them of them go to school. She is a farmer and has been farming for 6 years. With the loan requested from Kiva, she would like to buy more fertilizer so she can grow maize to sell. The profits from the business will be used to increase her standards of living and pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

They formed four months ago with the aim of working in solidarity to be able to access loans from Pana Pana to be able to have the opportunity to improve their small businesses, improve their incomes, and, thereby, improve their families' quality of life.\r\n\r\nElsa Juan:  She is a friendly women, coordinator of the Solidarity Group BISMONA, married, 55 years old, and has three adult children.  With the objective of having her own source of income, two years ago she began making a living selling beauty products through a street vending catalog.  Thanks to the previous loans that Pana Pana has provided her, she has been able to diversify her income from different sources: gradually building six wooden rooms that she rents and the street vending of beauty products.  \r\n \r\nShe is requesting funding to buy in Managua: creams, perfumes, gold plated jewelry, steel, among other products, and thus be able to offer more products and increase her income.

It is the place of the famous straw hats. <br \/><br \/>It is here that 49 year old Santos lives, married, and has two children ages 23 and 22 who study in the university. His spouse is a housewife and helps his with his work. Santos has an automotive repair shop and a locale where he sells parts and repairs for automobiles, the same that he uses to do his work. With this he ensures sales as the majority of purchases are parts, and his specialty is electronic and computerized automobile parts. There are many customers who arrive to his shop for him to work on their vehicles as there are not many people who can fix this type of vehicle damage.  His wife helps him with the work and also his children help when they can. He has had this business for more than 6 years in a rented locale. <br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to buy certain electrical parts that he needs to stock his business. He has been in the Grupo de Credito for 3 years and he likes it because the interest rates are low as compared to other banks. His dreams are to have his own locale and not pay rent."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1750352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy electrical parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-12-17T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-31T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Thony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1579.73,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":197.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":197.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800.03,"local_amount":789.88,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":800.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595162790},{"amount":400,"local_amount":394.94,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785529},{"amount":399.97,"local_amount":394.91,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":399.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232266}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T01:31:45Z","paid_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":810136,"name":"San Rafael Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"San Rafael es un grupo muy unido y trabajador, que se esfuerza por poder ir mejorando, ellas est\u00e1n en su ciclo numero 20, y han ido creciendo gracias al trabajo de todas.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

She also grows clover, sunflowers and wheat for resale on 10 hectares of land.  She makes a monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS).  She will use this loan to buy livestock and prepare the land for sowing.

The community belongs to a zone that produces sugar cane and so the principal sources of employment are the land and the sugar factory.\r\n\r\nIn this community a group of four women was formed, two of which have 15 years of experience in their businesses, one of them two years, and the other one year. The loans that VisionFund has given them have been the necessary support so that their \u201cgold mines,\u201d their businesses keep growing. The group is composed of   \r\n\r\nMirella \u2013 fruit and cosmetics sales \r\nMar\u00eda Magdalena \u2013 grocery sales\r\nAlondra \u2013 chicken sales\r\nGuillermina \u2013 ceramics and gifts \r\n\r\nMrs. Mar\u00eda Magdalena is the mother of four children, all of them independent, who support their mother\u2019s activities when it\u2019s possible for them. She began 15 years ago by selling soft drinks, fried food, cookies and bread, and it was thanks to the business that her children continued studying. Mar\u00eda Magdalena also has a two-year-old grandson who spends all his time with his grandmother, or \u201cNana\u201d as he calls her.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magdalena began her business with the firm purpose of helping her husband with the \r\nhousehold expenses. She says that at the beginning she sold a variety of groceries, but with experience, she noticed which were the star products; now those are the only ones in which she invests. \r\n\r\n\u201cI am very happy in my business. I have gotten used to selling and being active,\u201d says do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, who will invest her profits and the loan that she is given to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new plan is taking shape Mar\u00eda Magdalena\u2019s mind: with her next profits she will buy oil, cheese, beans, masa, meat, cream and vegetables because she hopes to start selling snacks. For this she will also need to do some remodeling in the corridor of her daughter\u2019s house.  The idea of opening a new business originated from her providers who always ask her to prepare them a snack or meal. \r\n\r\nThe group expresses its thanks for the opportunity to receive a new loan to invest in their businesses. \r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the shop of Mar\u00eda Magdalena, who is wearing the blue blouse.

Khalqiz is married and she has four children (two daughters and two sons).  Her husband and her oldest son are currently working abroad.  One of her daughters is already married and living independently, so Khalqiz now lives with one son and one daughter.  The family live from what her husband and son send them.  Khalqiz has decided to start a new business in order to become financially independent.  She will be buying and selling cattle.  She has created all the conditions required for this type of business: she has a large barn and ample supplies of animal feed.  Her son will be helping her run this business.

He is married with six children between the ages of 5 and 19 years. All of them go to school. He is a farmer and has been farming for eight years. With this loan from Kiva, he would like to buy fertilizers for maize. The profits from the business will be used to buy food for home consumption and pay school fees for his children. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

","en":"This remarkably happy woman comes from the Khuroson district of Tajikistan, and her name is Bibihanifa.  She is 43 years old and she lives in a village of her own mountainous district with her husband, son and daughter.  She loves domestic animals and for this reason, she works in animal husbandry, which is very common among the residents of the village.  Bibihanifa has been raising cattle for eight years already.

She lives with her partner and has 2 children aged 10 and 1. Her business is selling traditional empanadas. She is a good mother and is entrepreneurial, generous, understanding, patient, a good listener, supportive, responsible and hardworking. She carries out her business in the southern area of the city, an area which is known for informal commerce of all kinds. The local climate is hot, tropical and humid with a temperature that varies during the day between 21-35\u00baC. \r\n\r\nFanny has a dark complexion and long black hair which is tied-back. Her mother tongue is Guarani and she speaks Spanish for business (In the picture she is at the back, dressed in black and holding a baby). She lives with her partner who works in construction and her children. Her eldest child goes to school and her youngest is learning to walk. Her desire to help her family led her to form a communal bank composed of people that own different businesses such as: selling fish, cosmetics, selling seasonal clothing, knitting, selling furniture, selling duvets and making leather wallets. They are asking for a loan to expand their businesses. \r\n\r\nFanny's business is making and selling traditional empanadas. An empanada is made of fine bread dough with a sweet or savoury filling and baked in the oven or fried. The most common empanadas are: \"de yucca\" (with a cassava or manioc base and filled with cheese or meat), \"de arroz\" (with a rice flour base), \"cu\u00f1apes\" (cassava flour, with cheese), \"masaco\" (plantain with cheese) amongst others. She works every day, using the oven in her house and then goes out to sell her empanadas at markets, fairs and nearby squares. She says that \"traditional food tastes exquisite, food from here is the best, tourist cannot stop eating it all day...\u201d Her dream is to have a tea room where she can bake and sell her empanadas, tending to many clients. She wants to be able to make this expansion to her business through buying tables, chairs and different types of flour in bulk. This would enable her to stop selling at markets and at the door of her house. This is her first loan cycle with this institution in the four years that she has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Fanny is asking for a loan to buy tables, chairs and flour in bulk to then sell at the door of her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1751003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables, chairs and flour in bulk to then sell at the door of her house.
