He is living in the rural area of Lahore, Pakistan. He is a very hardworking and gentle person. He is responsible for his two children and his old parents as well.\r\n\r\nKashif Ali is a milkman by profession, and sells milk in his community. He has been selling milk since 1996; now he is very expert and experienced in his profession. He is very expert at producing milk from a buffalo; he produces milk from his all buffaloes in no time. \r\n\r\nHe has many buffaloes; this is the reason he has to do very hard work to feed them. Every day, he takes his herd to the pasture for grazing, gives them a bath in the stream, and he has to stay with them the whole day due to a fear of theft. He has not much time for his family members. \r\n\r\nKashif Ali wants to get an assistant to look after his cattle, but he does not earn enough profit to afford the salary. \r\n\r\nKashif Ali is receiving his second loan, and he has been investing his previous loan in the same business.

In this way, he will be able to generate maximum profit from the sale of additional bakery items. \r\n\r\nRiaz Hussain is very thankful to Kiva and field partner BRAC Pakistan. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1765654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy bread, jam, milk, cookies, butter, sandwiches, patties, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-01-01T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-31T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Riaz Hussain","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10866},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":11183},{"due_date":"2015-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11510},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11847},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12193},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":12549},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":12916},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13294},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13682},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":14082},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":14494},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":11384}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.93},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.94},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":820266,"name":"M.

Hace poco sufri\u00f3 la p\u00e9rdida de su esposo aunque esto no la detiene para continuar con su negocio. Actualmente ya tampoco tiene ning\u00fan dependiente, pero sus hijos, nietos y nueras la visitan con frecuencia. \n\nDurante m\u00e1s de 25 a\u00f1os, se ha dedicado a la cr\u00eda y engorda de borregos que compra cuando apenas tienen algunos d\u00edas de nacidos y que conserva durante 8 meses en casa. Con el alimento y cuidados necesarios, puede obtener muy buenas ganancias ya que los animales alcanzan el peso y tama\u00f1o adecuados. Clara no necesita invertir tanto en alimento porque desde muy temprano los saca a pastar al campo; afortunadamente en su comunidad iniciaron las cosechas de ma\u00edz y cuando los productores terminan de cosechar, cortan y recogen el zacate (remanente del ma\u00edz), pero en algunos terrenos queda algo de pasto que Do\u00f1a Clara aprovecha para llevar a sus borregos.\n\nAhora solo tiene dos borregos grandes en casa, pero los vender\u00e1 en diciembre que es la temporada en que las personas compran los animales para preparar platillos como la tradicional barbacoa que ofrecen a sus invitados en fiestas como bodas, confirmaciones, bautizos, etc. Las personas prefieren festejar en esta \u00e9poca porque en la regi\u00f3n casi no llueve. \n\nDo\u00f1a Clara tiene pensado comprar dos borreguitas y un borreguito, este \u00faltimo lo utilizar\u00e1 como su semental para cuando las primeras crezcan y est\u00e9n preparadas para iniciar a dar cr\u00edas. Esto resultar\u00e1 de gran beneficio porque si todo fluye de acuerdo con sus planes, al final del siguiente a\u00f1o tendr\u00e1 siete borregos en total. Su grande sue\u00f1o es poder llegar a tener el mayor n\u00famero de borregos para que en cualquier momento que necesite dinero pueda echar mano de sus animalitos, venderlos y as\u00ed solventar el gasto.\n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Lourdes y Mauricia, ellas invertir\u00e1n en becerros; Teresa, Luz y Sof\u00eda, en la cr\u00eda de borregos y Juana, en su tienda de abarrotes. Ellas conforman el grupo \u201cEl Arroyo\u201d, nombrado as\u00ed porque muy cerca de su casas hay un peque\u00f1o arroyo que es muy importante en su vida porque cada vez que se quedan sin agua, bajan a \u00e9l para llevar el l\u00edquido vital a sus hogares.\n\nTambi\u00e9n se muestran muy agradecidas con KIVA y VisionFund porque gracias al pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1n hacer crecer sus negocios y con ello ayudar a solventar algunos gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en uno de los campos verdes de la comunidad donde Mauricia tiene sus borreguitos.

Recently she suffered the loss of her husband, although this doesn\u2019t stop her to continue with her business. She currently doesn\u2019t have any dependents relying on her, but her children, grandchildren and daughters-in law visit her frequently.  \t\r\n\r\nFor over 25 years she has worked in livestock rearing and cattle fattening. She buys them when they are in their first days of life, and keeps them for 8 months at her house. With the proper feed and care, she can get really good profits since the animals reach the right weight and size. Clara doesn\u2019t need to invest a lot in feed because she takes them out to graze from an early hour. \r\n\r\nLuckily, in her community just started the corn harvest. When the farmers finish the reaping, they cut and gather the fodder (what is left from the corn). However, in some lands the grass remains and Do\u00f1a Clara takes advantage of this to take her lambs to pasture.\r\n\r\nNow she only has two big lambs at her house, but she will sell them in December. At this time of the year people buy these animals to prepare traditional dishes, like barbacoa, and offer them to their guests in celebrations, like weddings, confirmations, baptisms, etc. People prefer to celebrate in this time of the year because the rains tend to be less frequent in the region. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Clara wants to buy two female lambs and one male lamb. She will use this last one as a stud for when the females reach an age to have offspring. This will be of great benefit because if everything goes according to her plan, at the end of the next year she will have seven lambs in total. Her biggest dream is to have the maximum amount of lambs so she can sell them at any given time in case she needs the money for her expenses.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Lourdes and Mauricia, and they will invest in bull calves. Teresa, Luz and Sof\u00eda will invest in lamb rearing; and Juana in her grocery store. They form the group \u201cEl Arroyo\u201d, named after the little stream near their homes, and which is of great importance to their lives since it provides them with water every time they don\u2019t have this service. \r\n\r\nThey are grateful to KIVA and VisionFund since thanks to this loan they will be able to make their businesses grow and pay for the household expenses and their children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\n*The picture was taken in one of the green fields of the community where Mauricia has her lambs.

She met a PT Rekan Usaha Mikro Anda (Ruma) field staff member who introduced her to Ruma about three months ago. She got excited and decided to try the mobile phone airtime business. \r\n\r\nFor the last three months, Suaibatul has been running the business really well and now the demand for mobile phone airtime is increasing. Therefore, she hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva that will be used to process more mobile phone airtime transactions. \r\n\r\nMost of her customers are her own female neighbors who have also adopted mobile phones. As the business runs, Suaibatul plans to add more mobile services to her community, such as a utility bill payment service. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Suaibatul is pictured standing inside her stall.

Ni Putu hopes that, through the MUK Pig Breeder Loan program, she will not only get capital but will also get training from MUK on the best way to feed and care for pigs.  \r\n\r\nThis is the group's first loan. Ni Putu will use her share of the loan to purchase piglets and pig feed. She plans to sell the piglets after six months for use as suckling pig. With her profits, she will help support her family of three by supplementing the income of her husband, who works as a farmer.  Ultimately, Ni Putu hopes that increased income will enable her to improve her house.

This group consists of four women who are Mariem, Saeeda, Fatima, and Mayser. The group hasn't completely repaid the first loan but applied for a concurrent loan of 120,000 YER from Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nMariem is the group's leader and requests a loan to purchase potatoes, cooking oil, and flour to use in her business. Mariem thanks Kiva lenders warmly for their first loan which enabled her to increase her business.

Her business is selling \u201cApi\u201d (a drink made of purple corn).\r\n\r\nFaviola is a good mother, independent, optimistic, constant, responsible, and hard-working. She works in the central zone, an area characterized by commerce of all types, plus universities, public offices, and private enterprises, all co-existing side by side. The climate is temperate all your round, varying between 14 and 24 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nFaviola has a dark complexion, with hair as dark as night, long and attractive. She uses glasses. Her mother tongue is Quechua and she speaks Spanish generally and in her commerce. She lives with her children; the girl studies in school, as does her older son. Her younger son will enter school next year. They live in a rental unit and share the bathroom and kitchen with other neighbors. (In the photo she is seated to the left, wearing a lily-colored blouse and light blue pants.)\r\n\r\nDue to the necessity of obtaining a better means of survival, she formed a bank composed of people with businesses such as: selling fried potatoes, selling sports clothes, a local general store, a butcher shop, sewing baby clothing, selling videos, and selling sandwiches, to solicit a loan to invest in their businesses.\r\n\r\nFaviola's business sells \u201cApi\u201d (a breakfast made from purple corn). When the city is still asleep and the vale of darkness is about to lift and initiate a new day, Faviola begins her day's work in the public market. She knows that the early customers that come to her post to breakfast will not request coffee, milk or tea, but rather, as is habitual in this season of the year, they will want the \u201cApi\u201d she prepares, and, accordidng to one of her customers, \u201conly she knows how to make it well.\u201d In a large bowl she boils water and adds the ingredients until she has the purple liquid that will accompany fried \u201cempanadas\u201d (stuffed rolls) and \u201csopaipillas\u201d (fried cheese bread). By 10:00 am, there won't be enough left to fill a cup. \u201cGenerally, I have to make two bowls, because in winter this is what they most want...,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve sales. She wishes to purchase tables and chairs in order to attend to more customers. This is their third cycle of loans with this institution during the three years it has been engaged in this activity.\r\n\r\nSo, this is Faviola's motive for soliciting a loan \u2013 to buy tables and chairs to serve a larger number of customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1767506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase tables and chairs in order to attend to a larger quantity of customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-01-01T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-31T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":3200,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Faviola Karem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marina Janneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Angela Zenobia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli Michele","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gustavo Basil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhoselyn Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2236.79},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2591.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2664.99},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2740.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2818.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2899.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2981.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3066.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":376.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":398.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.02},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":421.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325.35,"local_amount":2236.79,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2248.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554456},{"amount":376.91,"local_amount":2591.23,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2604.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624227010},{"amount":387.64,"local_amount":2664.99,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2678.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214186},{"amount":808.69,"local_amount":5559.73,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5587.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564309},{"amount":421.69,"local_amount":2899.12,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046281},{"amount":433.69,"local_amount":2981.65,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2996.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344116},{"amount":446.03,"local_amount":3066.49,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3081.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554360}],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T18:43:39Z","paid_date":"2015-08-17T13:40:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":811055,"name":"Maria Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Mar\u00eda Teresa  pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMujeres Emprendedoras\u201d de la ciudad del Cusco -

He is 28 years old and living in the popular area of Karachi, Pakistan.  He is a distributor by profession and has been running an egg distribution shop for many years. His customers are retailers, restaurants, households, etc.\r\n\r\nHis business is not doing very well lately due to a shortage of sufficient financing as he loses customers and is unable to deliver orders in a timely fashion.  His shop is situated in an underpopulated area where there are a lot of customers available. He finds this as an opportunity and wants to target them for egg distribution.

In order to further develop her business, Tursabubu requested a loan in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy sheep in order to increase her livestock headcount. Tursabubu plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her livestock quantities and saving money for her children's continued education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":354.74,"image":{"id":1755704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep in order to increase her livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alysh village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-12-17T18:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-31T18:00:10Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tursabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1381},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1810},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1863},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1917},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1973},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2031},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2090},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2151},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2214},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2278},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2345},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2947}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.86,"local_amount":1381,"processed_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610751689},{"amount":32.58,"local_amount":1810,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T09:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1876.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624799413},{"amount":33.3,"local_amount":1863,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1931.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.23,"payment_id":636161552},{"amount":34.51,"local_amount":1917,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T11:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1987.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649513946},{"amount":35.51,"local_amount":1973,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T12:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":664995721},{"amount":36.56,"local_amount":2031,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2105.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291107},{"amount":37.62,"local_amount":2090,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T12:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696500343},{"amount":36.54,"local_amount":2151,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2230.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.18,"payment_id":711411294},{"amount":36.82,"local_amount":2214,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2295.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.03,"payment_id":730933536},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":2278,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.89,"payment_id":752025572}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T23:31:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":814603,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is 42 years old and married with four children, two in school.\r\n\r\nJennifer works hard to provide for her family.

She sells shoes for both men and women and says, \"I follow the latest fashions and know what to recommend for every occasion\".  For the future, she hopes to open a shop of her own so that she no longer has to work as a street vendor.  \r\nSilvia is applying for a loan that she will use to stock her business with various models and sizes of shoes that she can sell over the coming holidays.  The investment will provide her with a means to increase her income and better support her family.  \r\nSilvia started her business 4 years ago and this is her first loan from the bank."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":923.62,"image":{"id":1751126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

is a freshman at the American University of Central Asia, Department of Psychology. Here is her story:\r\n\r\nI have the dearest mom in the world. My parents divorced when I was four years old, and my mother brought me up alone. We live with my grandmother, who is a pensioner. She has health problems and high blood pressure. She gets a limited state pension, which is not enough for her medicine, and she needs regular treatment. My father doesn\u2019t help us, and he didn\u2019t pay alimony. My mother relied just on herself and has done her best to raise me and support my grandmother.\r\n\r\nAUCA is a highly prestigious university in the region, with a solid core curriculum and high academic ranking. I believe that it is the best university in Kyrgyzstan. It has none of the flaws common for local institutions, such as bribery, dishonesty, and plagiarism. I always dreamed of studying at AUCA. Unfortunately, my mother is a single parent, and can\u2019t afford to pay a full tuition. \r\n\r\nI am really excited to become a part of this special community. I have chosen my path, but it has a lot of bumps, due to the high cost of university tuition. I hope that Kiva lenders will help me with my aspiration to be a student. I promise to study hard and be an active participant in any events. I have a good dancing and drawing skills, which allow me to contribute in AUCA\u2019s social life, and contribute to a nice atmosphere among the students. I would appreciate careful consideration of my request for a Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40,"image":{"id":1757192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Over the years, the owner has gained popularity through the package and the utility of her products. <br \/><br \/>Her first loan was used to purchase labels in large quantity. In response, the enterprise was able to catch a segment of the market. Now, Judite needs to meet its customers\u2019 expectations in terms of production. Tons of customers would like to buy more from her. That\u2019s why she turns to Zafen for a second loan. <br \/><br \/>Judite\u2019s passion for nature began when her daughter got ringworms. Using a mixture of natural oils under careful advice, she has created an efficient medicine solution, which has healed her daughter. Thus, she replicated the formula of that same medication to help other people affected by ringworms. As a result, many customers realize that Judite\u2019s products make their hair healthier. From that, she was encouraged by her customers to open her business. <br \/><br \/>Judite made connections to export her products to friends and relatives in the United States. She had her first exposure to the national market in 2009. Judite participated in empowering rural women.

She purchases almonds wholesale in her village and in surrounding villages, and then sells them for a profit in the markets in the region.  In this way, she is able to contribute to her family's budget.  Gultor now needs to purchase almonds, but due to insufficient financial funds, she cannot accomplish this goal.

Meet Ruth, a very hardworking and self-driven farmer who is based in Kiapsang, a remote village in Eldoret. This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. Ruth is happily married and blessed with one lovely princess. \r\n\r\nFor the past 6 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. \r\n\r\nRuth is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Eldoret area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. Ruth is a member of Ebenezer Self-help Group and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will sell eggs to the local market and to her neighbors, hence improving her living conditions and getting out of the poverty situation she is in currently.

Meet Jackline, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Kipsomba, a remote village in Eldoret. She is happily married and  has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her family, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Eldoret area is very populated, and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1757337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-17T23:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-31T23:10:05Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.73,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.68,"local_amount":1571.37,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1598.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194816},{"amount":15.84,"local_amount":1407.56,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1432.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824584},{"amount":17.46,"local_amount":1552.31,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262671},{"amount":17.41,"local_amount":1547.92,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1575.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264824},{"amount":17.47,"local_amount":1552.48,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601011},{"amount":18.7,"local_amount":1662.63,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1691.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459470},{"amount":18.13,"local_amount":1645.41,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1674.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.38,"payment_id":681377887},{"amount":42.63,"local_amount":4013.68,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4084.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.52,"payment_id":711505865},{"amount":19.81,"local_amount":1827.94,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.75,"payment_id":731022681},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":3218.7,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3275.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.08,"payment_id":752110886}],"funded_date":"2014-12-17T23:45:26Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":814712,"name":"Asuman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asuman is a hardworking man, aged 34 years, and happily married with four children.

She decided that she will be independent and contribute to her community by practicing mixed farming. \r\n\r\nMiriam is married, and blessed with four lovely children who she refers to as \u201cmy heart beat.\u201d Her primary sources of income are milk selling, poultry farming, and some personal business that she does to supplement her meager income. Deciding to practice poultry farming for Miriam was not difficult. \u201cI was brought up with chickens raised by my grandfather and grandmother,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cIt is in my blood.\u201d \r\n\r\nFor the past ten years, Miriam has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and she wants to increase her poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. She is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. \r\n\r\nPoultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates a business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up.

Because of her immense farming knowledge, she has turned her farmland into an open university. Here, hundreds turn up to get trained in the hope that they will replicate her model on their own farmland. However, the biggest challenge she faces is satisfying the demand for milk in her village. The demand is overwhelming. She is seeking a loan to buy another dairy cow. She believes that through the loan, she will be able to improve her living conditions and be able to secure the future of her children. Having gone through training with Juhudi Kilimo, she is confident that the skills she acquired will help her increase her business and she will be able to pay back the loan.

To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Eldoret area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 40,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":366.43,"image":{"id":1757358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-17T23:30:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-01-31T23:30:26Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.72,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":5613.41,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5712,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824592},{"amount":69.06,"local_amount":6138.8,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6246.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264828},{"amount":35.29,"local_amount":3136.87,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3191.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459474},{"amount":35.18,"local_amount":3192.74,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3248.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.74,"payment_id":681377891},{"amount":42.69,"local_amount":3902.15,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3970.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"payment_id":696587560},{"amount":34.84,"local_amount":3280.42,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3338.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.06,"payment_id":711505869},{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":3684.19,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3748.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.5,"payment_id":731022685},{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":3623.2,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"payment_id":752110890}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T14:15:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":814720,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders! Meet Esther a very skilled farmer with experience in diverse areas of agriculture, with an innate talent for teamwork and with a great business mind. She is a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. \r\n\r\nEsther is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with two lovely children. For the past 14 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, milk, cabbage, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Esther has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. \r\n\r\nEsther mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Esther is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge hence suffering so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Esther is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Esther feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Esther will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, because she will increase her sales volume as she will be able to transport more goods to the market and hence increase her income level. Esther is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Esther will improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":687.44,"image":{"id":1757353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She has a dairy business.<br \/><br \/>Lola is an enterprising mother, sincere, generous, understanding, responsible, and hard-working. She works in the Chilaya pampa community located 85 kilometers from the city, near Lake Titicaca, an area with a cold and dry climate and daily temperature of 2-12 degrees centigrade.<br \/><br \/>Lola has a dark complexion, is short, and dresses traditionally. Her first language is Aymara and her second language is Spanish which she uses daily and in business in the city. She shares her life with her husband who is a farmer and her children, the oldest studies in school and the younger children play during the day. Her business is a dairy producing milk and dairy products such as yogurt, cheese, etc.  She works every day of the week, at all hours. Milking the cow is totally manual and she doesn't use any machines. The stable she has is spacious, where the cattle can move with normalcy. The cold climate affects the quantity of milk that each animal produces, so production increases in the summer and decreases in winter. Once she has the milk, it is destined to make some sort of dairy product, at other times it is sold to neighbors so that they may produce products.  She states, \"We came to a realization that sometimes we have to farm the earth and we sell the milk to our neighbors...\" <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to improve her stable in order to produce a greater amount of milk. She wishes to make an investment in her business by buying a milk cow in order to increase her production of dairy products. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 20 years that she has had this business. It is for these reasons that Lola seeks a loan to buy a milk cow and increase her production of dairy

Our region is mountainous one, where both summer and winter are cold. People of our village buy livestock and sell it when it is fat, in such way they try to earn money for living. We also have a cow, which gives much milk, what we sell and drink ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe are three people in my family: my mother, my grandmother and me. Unfortunately, both of them receive pensions due to their disability and are not able to have a full time job. I have never seen my father. We had good times with grandfather, but several years ago he passed away and we faced a lot of problems. Sometimes our relatives help us, but they can\u2019t support us totally as they have their own family.\r\n\r\nI studied at school with poor conditions and was so surprised when I won AUCA\u2019s full scholarship for one-year-program at New Generation Academy. So I got familiar with AUCA, met a lot of new friends, learned English and wished to be an undergraduate student here. Now my dream came true, but I need financial aid to pay my university\u2019s tuition fee. Thanks to Kiva loan I will be able to study at the best university in Kyrgyzstan and will be able to find good job, and support my family after graduation. If I help my family, I will save at least three people from poverty and better their life.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1757373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
