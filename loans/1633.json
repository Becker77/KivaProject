Her son and his wife live with Mukash. She has a secondary education. Since 2004, she has been practicing livestock breeding and crop farming. Thanks to Mukash's hard work and patient personality, she currently has 2 cows on her farm. Her average cumulative income is 18,000 som (KGS), however this amount is catastrophically not enough for a decent life. For the further development of her farm, Mukash turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 150,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle.

He went to school as far as the 7th grade, but then left school in order to work and support his family. He lives with his mother, a sister and two young brothers who are in school. Jose is a laborer. He is paid each day for working in different agricultural activities. He is grateful to his father for having taught him this work. He is also a farmer, growing basic grains such as corn and beans. He also raises cattle with his father, which provides him with good income. He gets up at 5:00 in the morning to go to work. When he finishes work at 2:00 pm he goes to work in his own fields for the rest of the day. The loan will be used to buy two calves, which he hopes will be good milk producers in the future in order to benefit his family. Jose is not ruling out the possibility of going back to school. He wants to buy more cows in order to increase his milk production. He hopes to build his own house, get married, and start a family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":393.36,"image":{"id":1738682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Youth","Start-Up"],"use":"to

She lives in the Shahrituz District. She is married and has four children. Firuza survived a huge tragedy in her life. She divorced her husband when she had one tiny child to take care. Going through a divorce for her, like for any other person, was not easy. However, a man came into her life who helped her financially and emotionally get back on her feet. He accepted her child and became her husband. Her husband also survived many hardships in his life. His wife died and left him with two children. Firuza accepted them as her own, as well, and gave them all of her motherly love. Now Firuza and her husband has four children in total (one they had together). One of their sons is working abroad, another is serving in the army.<br \/><br \/>Firuza and her husband have a joint business. They do car repairs and renovations. Her husband repairs the cars and does all of the hard labor. After her husband finishes his work, Firuza picks out a fitting paint color and paints the cars. Firuza and her husband have been in this field of work for the past 2 years.<br \/><br \/>The reason why Firuza requested a loan is for the expansion of their business. She wants to use the lent money to buy auto mechanic tools and painting materials. With a complete tool kit, she will be able to prepare good working conditions for herself.

She is single. In 2011, Wuroh established her salon business. She was trained to be a hairdresser so she decided to have her own shop to make money. Her business is located in the outskirts and her main customers are adults. Working 6 days a week and 13 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

John joined One Acre Fund for the first time this season, but he has been a farmer for 10 years.\r\n\r\nLike many other farmers, John decided to work with One Acre Fund in order to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. He hopes that by joining One Acre Fund and using the seeds and fertilizer he will get with this loan, he can join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers who  have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program. He plans to use the profits he earns from this year\u2019s harvest to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nJohn's Group will use the farming inputs received with this loan to cultivate a total of 5.25 acres of land. They will also receive a total of eight solar lights. Even though John decided not to, some of the farmers in the group will be purchasing a solar light as part of their loan package.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1752882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-01-02T04:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T04:20:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lazarus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Japhether","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frankline","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90960,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90960}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T06:39:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":814808,"name":"Lan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lan would like to take a further loan to buy new hairdressing tools, cosmetics, and beauty care products to sell from her store.

Her oldest son, named Mukhriddin, is a university student, and her two younger children are still in school.  Mukhriddin studies full-time at the Tajik University of Law, Business and Politics, and he is now in his second year.

For some members, this loan would help to rebuild their unstructured duck farms.  More ducks would let them have increased income from more duck eggs.\r\n\r\nMost villagers here are farmers that specialize on cropping as well as seasonal fruits or vegetables. Almost all married women stay as housewives and open grocery stores at home, as well taking care of the home-raised livestock such as ducks, hens or pigs. Some girls work as tailors in the town and come back to the village once in three months.\r\n\r\nPicture above are the CBO members Taw Ka Yan Lay Group 2, named U Than (Tu), U Win, U Aung, U Than (T) and U Than (O).  Included in the photo above, U Than (Tu) (in the middle), is 50 years old. He is married and has four children who are still at school. The same as other members, he too is a farmer and has nine acres of crop farm. His wife helps him to look after the ducks and sometimes on the farm too. He currently has 100 ducks.

Her dream is to become a master embroiderer and sell her blouses in many parts of the country and, maybe one day, even abroad. Together with her husband and their four children, she strives every day to give the little ones every chance to get ahead in life that she did not have. With the Christmas season approaching, she needs to buy more cloth of all colours to embroider blouses, in order to have a greater variety of products on offer. She also needs to buy boxes of sewing thread, since what she has will not be enough. Thus, she asks for a loan in order to buy the supplies she needs and take advantage of the holiday season to increase her sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1752964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy the supplies she needs to make traditional clothing and sell it.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2014-12-18T10:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T10:50:01Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1526.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595159642},{"amount":200.83,"local_amount":1506.25,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1533.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610555985},{"amount":199.17,"local_amount":1493.75,"processed_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624454286},{"amount":200.41,"local_amount":1503.05,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-24T11:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1529.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":637908717},{"amount":55.34,"local_amount":415.07,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":422.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649566246},{"amount":203.98,"local_amount":1529.88,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1557.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665048389},{"amount":140.27,"local_amount":1052,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-24T12:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1070.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":683055005}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T19:43:59Z","paid_date":"2015-07-24T12:11:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":811928,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Elizabeth tiene 42 a\u00f1os, es casada y madre de 1 ni\u00f1o estudiante de primaria, Su n\u00facleo familiar esta compuesto por su esposo, hijo, su padre y un hermano.

The fishing on Lake Titicaca is one of the most beautiful fishing arts, small scale and respectful of the lake and the maritime treasures it has. This art consists of throwing in a line of net that is about 30 meters long. The net settles to the bottom where it is left for a day to act as a trap. Then it is collected, making sure it is not dragged ruining the lake floor, only trapping the pieces that are the size of the netting and fishing only the species desired. The \"wallage\" (local food) has an important fish ingredient that gives it flavor and is called \"karachi\", he comments. <br \/><br \/>His dream is to have a fish store.

microenterprise. She sells saris, dresses, shirts, T-shirts and stoles for a small profit after buying them at wholesale rates. Through her clothing business, she earns Rs. 2,500 per month, which is 25% of her household income, and supports her household with her husband. The income generated through the business keeps them financially afloat, and helps them envisage a plan for a secure future. \r\n\r\nHowever, Sunitaben's monthly household savings of Rs. 5,000 won't suffice for her future plans as well as her business expansion objectives. Her idea of expanding her microenterprise is to: buy the complete inventory of her clothing business in bulk, cater to the increased demand from her customers, and increase her profits. As an added benefit, buying in bulk will help her negotiate better purchase rates from her suppliers, improving her profit margins. Overall, she stands to net an extra Rs. 4,000 each month, should she put her plan into action. Of this, she will take home Rs. 1,500, and will reinvest the rest in developing her small business further. \r\n\r\nRaising the capital for her expansion plan is not possible through banks, since she is a low-income entrepreneur who needs a microloan below the amounts banks typically offer as high-interest business loans. So, along with the four members from her group, all seeking to expand their respective micro-enterprises, Sunitaben has decided to raise the capital through crowdfunding. Kailashben, Lilaben, Dhaniben, and Lilaben want to invest in growing their respective milk parlor, ready-made garments, wood, and cutlery microenterprises. Together, they are seeking a loan of Rs. 70,000.\r\n\r\nAs she ages, Sunitaben wants to ensure financial stability for herself and her husband.

She runs her own small business supplying tiffins within her neighborhood. She buys fresh ingredients from the market, cooks delicious healthy meals, and delivers them as packed lunches to her customers. Through this, she earns a monthly income of Rs. 5,000, which, put together with her husband\u2019s income of Rs. 7,000, is used to cover living expenses for her family. Her household of five includes her teenaged child; they live in the Kutch district of Gujarat, in western India.\r\n\r\nMaya, who did not go to school due to poverty, wants to ensure that she can give her child access to a life better than hers through education. But with a household savings of Rs. 2,000 this seems to be an impossible task. \r\n\r\nMaya has come together with a group of women to crowdsource a loan of Rs. 75,000. With her share of the loan, Maya will expand and grow her tiffin business, allowing her to reach out to more customers and increase her household income by 60 percent. She will be able to buy more ingredients and produce, and take on more orders. As business grows, she may even hire a helper to cater to more orders. With the projected increase in business, she stands to net an additional Rs. 8,000 a month. She will invest about 35-40 percent of this back into growing her business further, so that its growth becomes self-sustaining. The rest, she will take home as personal savings.\r\n\r\nLike Maya, group members Pusphaben, Soniyaben, Sushila, and Kalavati are all married with children and looking to start or grow their own respective petty shop, cloth selling, and papad making microenterprises. \r\n\r\nAll these women seek the loan to make their households more financially stable and provide an education for their children, something they never had access to. Your loan will empower five hardworking, industrious women to secure their children\u2019s future. Mayaben, in particular, expresses her gratitude for your support and this opportunity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1758446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She already has two years of experience with the production and sale of bread. Currently 19 people work with her, 12 of whom are deliverymen and the remaining 7 who work to make the bread. All day in the bakery there is laughter, singing, and chatter while working the dough, turning on the oven, and preparing the trays and baskets in order to make ready conchas, caprichos, cuernos, laureles and many other types of bread.\r\n\r\nFor Primitiva it is very important to get along with her employees to create a better work environment. Everyday at 3 p.m., the bread is ready and she begins to count the pieces that each seller is responsible for. Of the three bakeries that are in the neighborhood, hers is the most popular for its taste because a wood-burning stove is used. The employees, while laughing and joking, say that the best ingredient is the love with which the bread is baked, to be happy at work and to feel motivated. \r\n\r\nPrimitiva will invest the loan to buy flour, firewood, vegetable shortening, sugar, natural dye, sesame, cheese, paper bags, and trays. She states that profits from the loan will equally be invested to purchase flour, butter, firewood, sugar, and brown paper. With her profits she has reconstructed one of the walls of the bakery. She says, \"I hope to soon be able to build the two walls that are still made of wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many have asked me what is the secret to my success and I always respond to learn to not bother myself with things that are not worth it.\"\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the house of Primitiva, who is holding the log.

Su negocio lo realiza en la zona \u2018plan 3000\u2019 un \u00e1rea caracterizado por ser el barrio m\u00e1s poblado de la ciudad, y por el comercio que realizan los descendientes de inmigrantes de etnias del lugar como los \u2018Ayoreos\u2019 y mineros relocalizados de occidente, de clima c\u00e1lido, tropical y h\u00famedo con una temperatura constante de 30 grados cent\u00edgrados durante todo el a\u00f1o.\nGilka es de tez morena, cabello negro largo amarrado, baja estatura, su lengua materna es el guaran\u00ed y habla espa\u00f1ol por cultura general y por el comercio que realiza (la segunda de la izquierda, usa pantal\u00f3n celeste y chaqueta blanca). Vive en casa de sus padres que est\u00e1 construida de ladrillo y cuenta con agua potable, electricidad y alcantarillado. Debido a la necesidad de crecer en su negocio form\u00f3 una banca de personas con negocios como; servicio de transporte, tienda de videos, venta de vajillas, venta de celulares, venta de carne de pollo, venta de flores y servicio de t\u00e9, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y ampliar sus negocios. Su negocio es la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de pan y masitas t\u00edpicas, como; Cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (Peque\u00f1o bollo hecho de harina de yuca con queso), Empanada de arroz (Horneado de arroz y queso), Zonzo (Pur\u00e9 de yuca mezclado con queso y formado en un palito para cocinarse al horno), Bizcochos de trigo (Bollitos duros de harina de trigo), Masaco de pl\u00e1tano (Pl\u00e1tano de fre\u00edr aplastado y mezclado con queso, cerdo o charque de res). \"Fue mi madre de quien aprend\u00ed el oficio y ahora administro mi negocio.

Balanza de precisi\u00f3n: Imprescindible pesar los ingredientes con medidas exactas y en peque\u00f1as cantidades. Jarra medidora: Una jarra con marcas visibles es muy \u00fatil para medir los l\u00edquidos. Cucharas medidoras: para tener ingredientes con la medida justa. Rodillo: se utilizan para estirar la masa, y otros. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 2 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Gilka solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de materiales de panader\u00eda, para elaborar masitas tradicionales.\n","en":"Gilka, 23, is single and has no children. She makes and sells bread and traditional pastries.\r\nShe is sensitive, honest, generous, sympathetic, responsible and hard-working. She works in the neighbourhood 'Plan 3000', the most populated area in town. This neighbourhood is known for being a trading hub for the descendants of immigrants of ethnic minorities, such as the Ayoreos, and for relocated miners from the West of the country. Here, the weather is hot and humid, tropical indeed, with a constant temperature of 30 degrees Celsius the whole year round.\r\nGilka is dark-skinned and wears her long black hair in a ponytail. She is not very tall. Her mother tongue is guaran\u00ed; she learned Spanish by hearing people speak it around her and by speaking with her customers. In the picture, she is the second person from the left, sporting jeans and a white jacket. She lives at her parents' house, which is made of brick. It has drinking water and electricity and is connected to the sewer system. Gilka saw the need to make her business grow and thus gathered people to create a communal bank. The members have varied occupations, such as: providing transportation services, selling videos, selling crockery, selling mobile phones, selling chicken meat, selling flowers and owning a tea room. The aim of the group is to ask for a loan in order to improve their businesses. Gilka makes and sells bread and traditional pastries, such as: cu\u00f1ap\u00e9s (a small bun made of yuca flour mixed with cheese), rice empanadas (made in the oven with rice and cheese), zonzos (mashed yuca mixed with cheese, moulded into a cylindrical shape, and baked in the oven), wheat buns (hard balls of wheat flour), plantain pur\u00e9e (mashed plantains mixed with cheese, pork, or beef jerky). She tells us that she learned everything from her mother, who passed on her secret recipes to her. Thanks to this, Gilka is now able to manage her own business. Her dream is to own a proper bakery shop so as not have to peddle her wares. She wants to improve her operations by purchasing baker's tools, such as: a rubber spoon, to mix flour and yeast; stainless steel bowls, in which to make dough, with assorted lids for special types of dough; a scraper, without which there is no removing the dough stuck to the bowl; precision scales, to properly weigh ingredients, especially in small quantities; a measuring jug, so useful when measuring liquids thanks to its markings; measuring spoons, for the precise baker; and of course a rolling pin, that staple of baking. Gilka has been in business for two years, but this is her first loan with the field partner.\r\nShe will use the loan to buy baker's tools in order to make traditional pastries.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":1751753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to
