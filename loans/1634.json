","en":"Qurbongul is a resident of the Khuroson district. She is 67 years old and a widow. Qurbongul lives with her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. Just like many of her village neighbors, she is involved in animal husbandry. She started her own business in reselling cattle 6 years ago and continues it to this day. Her daughter-in-law helps her with the business. Qurbongul and her family live in a remote village, almost at the edge of the district. Public transportation is almost unavailable in their village, making it very difficult for them to get from the village to the district and vice versa. Qurbongul has been wanting to purchase a car for a long time, but has not been able to achieve her goal due to the lack of finances. She decided to obtain a loan for the remaining amount and finally buy a car. Qurbongul really hopes for the financial support because she wants to improve her life circumstances."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1755785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khuroson","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-12-18T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Qurbongul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":684.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":707.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":760.56},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":758.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":776.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":824.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":844.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":862.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":901.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":930.84},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":959.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":989.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.16},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":823305,"name":"Musa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musa is a married man and a father of four children, all of whom attend school.

and lack of mentors. In addition, in some parts of Kenya like Litein, more women were rendered poor by the clashes that followed the disputed presidential elections of 2007. Their men were killed and property destroyed, leaving women that were once financially stable and even of middle-income bracket, vulnerable to poverty. Years down the line, Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that concentrates on small holder farmers, came to their rescue, training marginalized women from rural areas on how to do agriculture better, and advertise and sell their farm produce directly to the market. \r\n\r\nMonica from \u201cExcel Self Help Group\u201d in Eldoret applauds the initiative for transforming her life. She is a loving mum to three angel-looking children and has been farming for the past 10 years. Monica passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that she knows her cows, each individually, because she works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. She and her husband have even named one of them \u201cBrown.\u201d \r\n\r\nMonica practices mixed farming and through this humble task she aspires to offer all of her children a university education. Monica learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to her parents. She has a tiny plot of land to live off \u2013 just under half an acre \u2013 and has always struggled to support her family. She has developed the farm in the sloping, undulating terrain by successfully adopting suitable soil and water conservation methods, such as stone pitched bench terracing and digging rainwater storage pits. Milking and feeding her own cows is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nProfits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family, and she wants her cows to produce more milk. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy animal feed. With this animal feed, her cows will be able to increase milk production, which will translate to increased income. She believes that through careful selection and the application of the strict standard of excellence in keeping her dairy cows, she will have more income, which will improve her living

Joyce is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow. That makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, Joyce lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and buy a chaff cutter. Through the loan, she will have a better time milking and feeding her cow. A good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax and be protected from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Through the loan, she will also be able to buy a chaff cutter which is a mechanical device used in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to produce better feed for the cow. The chaff cutter also prevents the animals from rejecting any part of the food. \r\n\r\nJoyce believes that through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit. Joyce waits for your kindness.\r\n\r\nFemale small-scale farmers dominate the agricultural landscape in most production environments in Kenya, yet they constitute the majority of rural actors locked in socio-cultural structures that limit their agricultural productivity, efficiency and effectiveness at all points across the value chain. Key examples are entrenched inequities in access to productive land, limited access to credit, poor access to markets, extension services and agricultural technologies relevant to their needs. Kiva lenders, the above picture presents Joyce who started farming 10 years ago on a small inherited piece of land in Kiplombe, a remote village in the Eldoret area of Kenya.

She is a wise farmer who is respected by her neighbors and fellow farmers as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, which is in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Sarah is happily married and is blessed with three lovely children. For the past 12 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and she grows maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Sarah has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with a challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up, and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family.\" Sarah joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Sarah is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes), which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Sarah to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Sarah feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Sarah will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. Sarah is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Sarah will use the loan to improve her living conditions and ensure a secure future for her children and grandchildren to come.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1757547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-18T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.92,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.53,"local_amount":4620.07,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T13:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4661.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595194820},{"amount":111.88,"local_amount":10030.34,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10119.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824616},{"amount":67.41,"local_amount":6043.25,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6096.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264840},{"amount":55.65,"local_amount":4989.34,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5033.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601019},{"amount":21.93,"local_amount":1965.86,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1983.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459484},{"amount":55.32,"local_amount":5064.92,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5109.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.17,"payment_id":681377898},{"amount":60.86,"local_amount":5610.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.72,"payment_id":696587569},{"amount":61.58,"local_amount":5847.61,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5899.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.64,"payment_id":711505878},{"amount":223.92,"local_amount":20828.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":21012.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.39,"payment_id":731022695}],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T00:31:35Z","paid_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joan Parks","image":null}},{"id":815090,"name":"Lina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lina is 44 years old and married, with four children.\r\n\r\nLina works hard to provide for her family.

She owns a five-acre farm where she practices mixed farming. On the farm she keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. She has seven years of experience in farming. Anne is seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. \r\n\r\nLoans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Anne. Through a group of ten members called Toror Bonet self-help group, Anne has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholder farmers, both unskilled and semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Anne because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375.44,"image":{"id":1757541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To expand her horticulture farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-18T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.36,"local_amount":6698.23,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6815.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824614},{"amount":34.05,"local_amount":3026.75,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3079.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264839},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":2997.24,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3049.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601018},{"amount":36.63,"local_amount":3255.95,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3313.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459483},{"amount":37.1,"local_amount":3368.17,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3427.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.79,"payment_id":681377897},{"amount":36.07,"local_amount":3295.8,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3353.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.01,"payment_id":696587568},{"amount":36.38,"local_amount":3425.08,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3485.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.15,"payment_id":711505877},{"amount":37.72,"local_amount":3478.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3539.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.41,"payment_id":731022694},{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":3826.87,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3894.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.28,"payment_id":752110896}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T20:28:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Ingram","image":566975}},{"id":815012,"name":"Diphas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Diphas is a hard-working farmer from a cell in Nyakayojo, Mbarara district.

and going forward with her family. She is a mother of two and is from Eldoret, a remote town in Kenya. She has spent the last five years of her life farming. She sells eggs, milk, and vegetables produced on her farm. She also engages in a personal business to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nHellen is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities she involves herself in, poultry farming is closest to her heart. She enjoys waking up every morning to go and feed her animals. She is so close with her animals that she has nicknamed one of them \u201cKipara,\u201d meaning \"no feathers on the head.\"\r\n\r\nHellen wants to take full advantage of poultry farming as a profitable business venture. She would like to expand her poultry business, but the biggest challenge she faces is lack of capital. She is requesting a loan of 50,000 KES, which she will use to buy additional poultry. With your loan, Hellen will be able to expand the poultry section on her farm. This will generate enough income to repay the loan, and she will also be able to save extra money.\r\n\r\nHellen is very concerned about her children\u2019s education, so profits from farming will go to pay their school fees. Hellen dreams of a secure future for her children. She awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":302.8,"image":{"id":1757548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-18T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T18:00:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.01,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2150.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2213.26},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2277.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2344.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2413.03},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2483.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2556.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2707.72},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2786.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2868.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2952.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3038.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3127.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3218.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3409.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3509.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.75},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.94},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.01},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.1,"local_amount":5312.93,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5526.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824618},{"amount":57.41,"local_amount":4992.42,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5192.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264841},{"amount":58.28,"local_amount":5067.57,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5271.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459485},{"amount":60.16,"local_amount":5378.22,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5594.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.69,"payment_id":696587570},{"amount":61.84,"local_amount":5579.51,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5803.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.32,"payment_id":731022696}],"funded_date":"2014-12-18T20:28:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joan Parks","image":null}},{"id":815102,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita is a married woman with five children.

Part of this will go towards almost doubling her income, and the rest she will invest in the further growth of her business, with the objective of achieving self-sustainability. A stalling factor in her expansion plans is her lack of access to capital.\r\n\r\nSince local banks do not cater to the microfinancing that women entrepreneurs like Hamidaben need, she has approached Milaap\u2019s field partner Prayas. Under the guidance of Prayas, Hamidaben has formed a joint liability group called \u2018Jay Shakti Mahila Mandal\u2019 with four other women who are all residents of Surendranagar and are involved in their own small-scale businesses.

Even now, with her own functioning business, her financial situation isn\u2019t good enough to raise her four children in a comfortable environment. Along with her husband, Hansaben manages to earn just about 14,000 India Rupees (INR) every month. She is involved in a small scale enterprise selling showpieces that are mostly made of glass. She buys her delicate and intricate inventory from the wholesale market in Surendranagar, Gujarat, and sells it to local customers at a profit. She saves her entire income of 4000 rupees that she earns from her efforts. With two pre-school aged children and two primary school-going children, though, she needs to save a lot more than this.\r\n\r\nNot one to be bogged down by difficulties, her plans for expanding her business pushed her to seek the help of Milaap and its field partner, Prayas. With appropriate guidance from the two organizations, Hansaben has formed a joint liability group with four other women in her community. While two of her group members are involved in a scrap business, the other two are involved in embroidery and selling showpieces, respectively. A loan of 100,000 rupees will give them a well-deserved opportunity to grow their businesses, diversify their clientele, and grow profits. Your loan will help develop their microenterprises into self-sustaining businesses that ensure financial stability for their families and access to education for their children. \r\n\r\nHaving had no opportunity to attend school due to her own parents\u2019 poverty, Hansaben especially feels strongly about education. She knows how important it is to learn to read, write, and have a college degree. She believes that these factors will open opportunities and choices, which she did not have, for her children to uplift themselves. She is determined to make a success out of this opportunity. To begin with, she will increase her profits by 6000 rupees per month, saving part of it and reinvesting the rest into her business, eventually making it self-sustaining. She is grateful for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1758251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations

A month ago the sugar cane harvesting period began and with it the reactivation of the region's economy as the majority of the inhabitants of the community work in the fields.

Mounted on her motorcycle from 4 in the morning she is off to buy bread and then travels through the streets selling it. When she started the business her investment was very small but in a few months she got her first loan from VisionFund which increased the amount of pieces she could buy. <br \/><br \/>Today Modesta is looking for a provider so she can get more accessible prices. Modesta is the mother of 3 children, one of whom helps her drive the motorcycles for the afternoon sales. Felix, Modesta's husband works in the fields and the continuity of his work is important for paying the household expenses. <br \/><br \/>This loan Modesta needs to buy a new basket and more bread. Her great dream is to open a bakery to build a legacy for her children. \"In a year of selling bread a lot of things have happened. We fell into a mud puddle, the dogs have chased us and we have been stranded without gasoline.

a part of Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat. Featured in the center of the picture, 40-year-old Parulben runs her own small business. She purchases decorative articles in bulk from the wholesale markets and sells them locally for a profit. After expenses for purchases and transportation, she takes home an income of 3000 India Rupees (INR) per month. This meager sum contributes 25% of her family\u2019s income. Married, Parulben lives with her husband and two more family members. Their monthly savings of 5000 rupees provides a financial cushion during emergencies. But to ensure a better living standard, cope with rising costs, and build a stable nest-egg for the old age, they need to start earning and saving more. \r\n\r\nSeeking to improve her own situation, Parulben has decided to crowdfund an enterprise loan together with her hardworking and determined group members. They seek a loan of 65,000 rupees. Parulben will use her share of the loan to invest in buying sari laces, colorful artificial flowers, and stoles, which fetch a higher demand and profits. This investment will result in increased sales and margins, leading to an increase of 5000 rupees in her enterprise income. She will set some of this aside as savings and reinvest the rest into her business. Parulben\u2019s plans are long-term. She wants to convert her business into a sustainable income source.

This determined lady runs a small scale business and sells decorative items, such as lace used in saris, artificial flowers, and stoles. The income of 3000 India Rupees (INR) she earns through this business accounts for almost 30% of her household income. Together with her husband, she saves 3500 rupees per month. They have a young child of pre-school age, and are saving for their child\u2019s future education. A young couple, their current savings will not be adequate to cover education costs as well as provide a buffer during emergencies. \r\n\r\nSeeking to improve her family\u2019s standard of living and guarantee enough savings for her child\u2019s future, Kamuben has decided to grow her decorative items business. She wants to stock up the fast-selling and profit fetching items on her inventory in bulk and greater variety. This will help her cater to the demand for these items in a semi-urban thriving area like Chandkheda, especially during the auspicious wedding and festive season. This initiative will increase her income by 2000 rupees, which is a significant figure for her, amounting to a 66% hike, given her current modest earnings. The rest of her profits, she will invest in the further development of her business. \r\n\r\nKamuben's other team members, Ushaben, Geetaben, and Kokilaben also want to develop their own decorative items businesses to an appreciable position. Another team mate, Sarojben, wants to expand her sari selling small business. These hard working and confident women lack the funds for initial capital. So they seek a loan of 50,000 rupees, which they will repay within 12 months in installments. \r\n\r\nYour loan will help five families access an enhanced income that will help them to secure their childrens' futures. Having had a very basic primary education due to her family\u2019s socio-economic limitations, Kamuben is very determined to put her child through college. She is particularly thankful for your support and this opportunity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600.02,"image":{"id":1757967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy more decorative sari lace, artificial flowers, and stoles and grow her decorative articles business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chandkheda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-01-02T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamuben Vishnuji","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ushaben Rajubhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geetaben Maheshbhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kokilaben Chunilal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarojben Jagdishbhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624464679},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-20T11:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636638971},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649620376},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100435},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398516},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608682},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532436},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046980},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4229.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135725}],"funded_date":"2015-01-17T17:48:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":823284,"name":"Theodomile","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theodomile is 30 years old.

Her family consists of five members, including two young children. Despite all the household responsibilities, she is ready to expand her business to the next level. By expansion, she means to keep a wide variety of vegetables such as potatoes, onions, carrots, garlic, cabbages, etc. Because of a lack of funds available to invest, she is unable to grow her business. <br \/><br \/>To source the necessary microfinance that will cover her expansion capital, Bhagvatiben formed a group with four other like-minded local women entrepreneurs. The team she leads comprises Anuben, who caters meals through her tiffin center, Ranjanben with her \u2018cutlery\u2019 business selling accessories, Sarasvatiben, who sells snacks, and Jyotsana with her sari-selling microenterprise. They collectively seek to crowdfund a loan of Rs. 65,000 towards the growth of their businesses.<br \/><br \/>With her share of the loan, Bhagvatiben will purchase in bulk the vegetables that have a higher local demand and fetch a better retail price. Buying in bulk will help her negotiate better rates with her suppliers and also save her the cost of transporting them back to her place in multiple trips. She will also be able to serve more customers. The investment and subsequent growth will help her enterprise earn an extra Rs. 6,000 per month. This amount will double her contribution towards her household income and savings. It will also leave enough money each month to reinvest in developing her business and to repay the loan. <br \/><br \/>Coming from a financially weak family, Bhagvatiben could not continue her education, and had to leave her studies unfinished after attending primary school. But, like her group members, she has an unswerving faith that through her hard work, she will not let the young children in her family leave their education midway because of the very same reason. Your support in her endeavor to increase her income and savings will help Bhagvatiben achieve this goal of guaranteeing education for the children in her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":768.77,"image":{"id":1757962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is married and the happy mother of four children. She has twelve grandchildren. Azizmo finished the tenth grade at school, but did not get secondary or higher education. Despite this she does not complain about her life. \r\n\r\nAzizmo has worked with livestock breeding and crop cultivation for a period of more than 30 years already. Even if this is hard work that requires stamina and physical strength, she is able to cope with everything. She has a herd of ten rams and three cows.

He is married and the young and happy father of three children. He grew up in a village and since childhood he worked with livestock breeding. Abdunazar has bred the livestock on his own plot of land for a period of twelve years already. In the beginning he had only two heads of livestock, but currently he has a whole herd of rams. He also has two cows. His wife sells the milk he gets from the dairy cows on the market. \r\n\r\nAbdunazar understands that in our times it is necessary to have higher education in order to get good work and a good life, and not be in need of anything. Therefore he works day and night in order to have the opportunity to educate his children. \r\n\r\nAbdunazar takes a loan in order to increase his herd and purchase fodder for the winter season. He does not have the full amount of money for this. Therefore he turned to \"MDO Arvand\" for financial support. He hopes that \"MDO Arvand\" will lend him the necessary amount which will give him the opportunity to expand his business. He thanks in advance for the support and faith.

As a person he is calm, balanced and hard working. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for his family, Toktogul has long worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business many years ago. Thanks to Toktogul's persistent work, he currently has three sheep and a plot of land of 0.35 hectares on which he grows potatoes for selling. \r\n\r\nToktogul's business brings in around 8,000 som (KGS) per month. This money is not enough for a decent life. Therefore, with an aim to further develop his business, Toktogul turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase eight sheep. He plans to invest the income from his loan in further developing his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1755940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase eight sheep in order to expand his business and increase his income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chuchuk village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-12-18T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T19:50:07Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toktogul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291112}],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T04:21:18Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":815211,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia works hard to support her family.

She is married and the mother of four children. She has brought up and educated four children, working day and night for several years in order to feed them and give them everything they needed. \r\n\r\nErkin has had a business of selling stationary items at the market for a period of 20 years. The sales are good. She has many customers every day. However, as there is a lot of competition at the market, she would like to bring in something new and unusual. \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business and purchase new goods, she needs a certain amount of money. Currently she does not have the full sum. Therefore she turned to \"MDO Arvand\" for financial support. She hopes that \"MDO Arvand\" approves her loan application and gives her the possibility to expand her business. She thanks for the support and faith in advance.

town in the Kutch district of Gujarat, in western India. She sews sari blouses, which require a great deal of skill to cut and sew, so they lend a perfect fit to her customers. She also stitches sari petticoats and pretty dresses for local women and their little daughters, who are satisfied customers who contribute to the success of her tailoring microenterprise. <br \/><br \/>Each month, Muktaben earns Rs. 7,000, matching the income her husband brings in to run their household expenses. A diligent housekeeper, she manages to save Rs. 1,000 after paying for their living expenses, her children\u2019s schooling, and in buying raw materials like thread, buttons, etc. for her microenterprise. With her teen-aged child nearing the age of getting ready for college, and her pre-schooler having years of schooling ahead, she needs to ensure there are more savings for their education. She also wants to set aside enough to deal with medical expenses and home repair costs that may occur as she and her husband advance in age. <br \/><br \/>She wants to grow the capacity of her tailoring business. To begin with, she needs to buy a new sewing machine, which will help her improve productivity and take on more tailoring orders both from local women and small retail customers. To access the funds to buy this new sewing machine, Muktaben formed a joint liability group with three other women entrepreneurs: Takhatba wants to grow her dairy business, Paruben wants to develop her grocery store, and Daxaba also wants a sewing machine for her tailoring enterprise. <br \/><br \/>The purchase of raw materials and stock requires hefty investments, so they seek a loan of Rs. 80,000. Your loan will help Muktaben, together with her group members, to take the necessary steps and realize the full earning potential of her microenterprise. She will be able to double her income, invest an equal amount in the further growth of her small business, and also greatly increase her savings by up to Rs. 6,000 a month. <br \/><br \/>Having had to drop out of school herself, Muktaben is extremely keen on ensuring that her children receive a full education right up to college. She is grateful for this opportunity and your support in helping her achieve financial stability so she can realize this goal."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":956.25,"image":{"id":1757938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Underfunded

Alexey also offers veterinary services in his village. He plans to grow corn, soy beans and barley in the future.

Mushkiniso loves her family and works hard for their wellbeing. Six years ago, she opened her own business in the sphere of livestock breeding. Before that, she had never worked anywhere. But life forced her to start earning money so that she could improve her family's financial circumstances. Mushkiniso learned from her neighbor all of the intricacies of fattening up and reselling cattle. Now, she has a lot of experience in this trade. Her sons help her with her business - they bring the cattle out to pasture every day. <br \/><br \/>In connection with the fact that the price of cattle falls during the winter, Mushkiniso would like to use this to her advantage and increase the size of her herd. This will allow her to earn a good profit from her business in the future. However, she does not have enough money to accomplish this goal, which is why she requested a loan.

With the profits that he gains from this year\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.\r\n\r\nXaviour and his group will receive a total of 13 solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 8 acres.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1743664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cost efficient maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, as well as a solar light.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Teso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-12-18T23:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-01T23:30:11Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xaviour","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sicolastica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tophister","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janefher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedetah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santilino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oliver","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Turfistah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":171550,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-24T22:27:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Marie Phillips","image":1667620}},{"id":810691,"name":"Miriam's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriam, pictured above, has 6 children and is always described as a very friendly person, which is why she was selected to become the group leader of her group.

Desde hace 10 a\u00f1os Do\u00f1a Sotera se levanta desde muy temprano para abrir la cortina que cubre su tienda de abarrotes. Con gran esfuerzo inici\u00f3 su negocio, su prop\u00f3sito era sentirse \u00fatil, obtener m\u00e1s ingresos y mantenerse ocupada. Recuerda que al principio fue un poco dif\u00edcil ver el producto de su trabajo ya que la mayor\u00eda de sus clientes le solicitaban mercanc\u00eda fiada por la falta de dinero (llevarse los productos y pagar en cuotas); en muchas ocasiones, nunca recibi\u00f3 el pago completo. Ante esta situaci\u00f3n y experiencia, una de las frases favoritas de Do\u00f1a Sotera es \"No dos veces se muere el burro en el mismo persogadero\" (Fool me once, same on you. fool me twice, shame on me).\n\nActualmente, la mercanc\u00eda que m\u00e1s se vende es: frijol, arroz, az\u00facar, sopa, chiles, huevos, aceite, papel higi\u00e9nico, leche y queso por lo que requiere invertir constantemente en estos mismos productos. D\u00eda a d\u00eda, sotera hace todo loposible para ofrecer un servicio de calidad y buen trato a los clientes; siempre est\u00e1 al tanto de la fecha de caducidad de sus productos y trata de mantener una sonrisa en el rostro. Con las ganancias que ha obtenido, a lo largo del tiempo ha incrementado la variedad de productos y la cantidad de mercanc\u00eda. Tambi\u00e9n ha comenzado a vender algunos art\u00edculos de papeler\u00eda. \n\nPara llevar el negocio nuevamente hacia adelante, Sotera quiere cambiar los anaqueles de la tienda por lo que ha comenzado a ahorrar y cuenta con mantener el apoyo de VisionFund en futuras ocasiones. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la tienda de abarrotes de la se\u00f1ora Sotera quien viste una blusa de color azul.

The group is named Las Estrellas (The Stars). The members are: Concepsi\u00f3n, who sells cosmetics by catalog; Erika, who sells shoes; Sotera, who sells groceries; Rosa, who sells groceries; Ana, who sells clothes; and Flor, who sells groceries.\n\nDo\u00f1a Sotera is 56 years old and is married to Se\u00f1or Silvestre, with whom she has four children. All are already adults. For 10 years, Do\u00f1a Sotera has gotten up very early to open the shutter that covers her grocery store. With great effort, she began her business. Her intention was to feel useful, obtain more income, and keep herself busy. She remembers that at the beginning it was a little difficult to see the results of her work, since the majority of her customers asked for merchandise on credit due to the lack of money (to take the product and pay in installments). On many occasions she never received the complete payment. In the face of this situation and experience, one of Do\u00f1a Sotera's favorite phrases is \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\"\n\nAt this time, the merchandise that is sold the most are beans, rice, sugar, soup, peppers, eggs, oil, toilet paper, milk and cheese, for which reason she needs to invest constantly in these same products. Day after day, Sotera does everything possible to offer quality service and good treatment to the customers. She always keeps track of the expiration date of her products and tries to keep a smile on her face. With the earnings that she has obtained, over time she has increased the variety of products and the quantity of merchandise. She has also begun to sell some stationery articles.\n\nTo again take the business forward, Sotera wants to change the shelves of the store, for which she has begun to save and is counting on keeping the support of VisionFund on future occasions.\n\nThe photograph was taken on the grocery store of Do\u00f1a Sotera, who is wearing a blue blouse.

Ellos practican la religi\u00f3n cristiana y el d\u00eda 10 de marzo celebran el aniversario del templo, su culto m\u00e1s importante. \n\nLucila, es una mujer muy trabajadora y entusiasta de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, su marido trabaja en la construcci\u00f3n de casas y son padres de 3 ni\u00f1os que se encuentran estudiando su educaci\u00f3n primaria. Anteriormente, la familia viv\u00eda en la capital del pa\u00eds, pero vivir en la ciudad significaba muchos gastos y el sueldo de su esposo era el m\u00ednimo lo cual no era suficiente para solventar todos los gastos de hogar. Fue entonces que decidi\u00f3 iniciar a vender antojitos mexicanos como chicharrones preparados, patitas de pollo, elotes, esquites, entre otros.\n\nEl negocio result\u00f3 productivo porque a los clientes les gustaba el saz\u00f3n de Lucila y as\u00ed permaneci\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os. Todas las tardes, afuera de la casa donde rentaba colocaba una mesita para vender, pero desafortunadamente otras se\u00f1oras comenzaron  negocios muy similares y el de Lucila fue decayendo poco a poco y lo tuvo que abandonar. Un d\u00eda, su esposo tambi\u00e9n tuvo un mal momento y se qued\u00f3 sin empleo, fue cuando se vieron obligados a regresar a su comunidad donde llevan viviendo ya 8 a\u00f1os.\n\nHace 5 a\u00f1os, Lucila le di\u00f3 otra oportunidad al comercio vendiendo dulces frente a una escuela primaria, pero le gustar\u00eda retomar la venta de sus antojitos mexicanos porque sabe que las ganancias son mayores.

Por el momento Lucila no cuenta con la inversi\u00f3n para iniciar el negocio de comida, pero trabajar\u00e1 para lograrlo, as\u00ed que necesita un pr\u00e9stamo que invertir\u00e1 en dulces, con su ingreso apoyar\u00e1 a su esposo con los gastos del hogar y seguir\u00e1 ahorrando. Sin embargo, el mayor sue\u00f1o de Lucila es mejorar su vivienda, hasta ahora el piso es de tierra y las ventanas las adecuaron para cubrirse del fr\u00edo, pero ella quiere un mejor hogar para su familia.\n\nAs\u00ed como Lucila quiere mejorar su calidad de vida y la de sus hijos, los dem\u00e1s integrantes tambi\u00e9n trabajan por sus seres queridos: Don Roberto quiere invertir en su taxi; Gabriel, Mauricio y \u00c1ngel, en la cr\u00eda de animales y Cristina, en una refaccionaria. \n\n*La fotograf\u00eda se tom\u00f3 junto al taxi de Roberto, su veh\u00edculo transita en la capital del pa\u00eds y no en la comunidad donde vive.

They live in the same community, and so they always get together to enjoy traditional celebrations. They are Christians, and on March 10th they celebrate the anniversary of the church, their most important moment of worship.\r\n\r\nLucila is a very hardworking and enthusiastic 30-year-old woman. Her husband builds houses, and they have 3 children who study in primary school. The family used to live in the country's capital, but living in the city meant many expenses. Her husband earned the minimum salary which wasn't sufficient to cover all of the household expenses. It was then that she decided to start selling Mexican snacks such as prepared pork rinds, chicken drumsticks, corn on the cob, and popcorn among other things.\r\n\r\nThe business was productive because Lucila's customers liked the flavor of her food, and it remained this way for two years. Every afternoon, outside of the house she rented, she set up a table to sell from. Unfortunately, other women started similar businesses, and so Lucila's business declined little by little, and she had to shut it down. One day, her husband also had a bad moment and was left without work. That was when they realized they had to return to their community where they have been living now for 8 years.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, Lucila gave her business another shot selling sweets in front of a primary school. However, she would like to resume selling her Mexican snacks because she knows that she earns more profit. She only earns 1 peso with the sale of a sucker, but she earns around 10 pesos with the sale of a plate of snacks. For the moment, Lucila doesn't have the resources to start her food business, but she will work to achieve it. She needs a loan that she will use to invest in sweets. Her income will help her husband with the household expenses and she will continue to save. However, her biggest dream is to improve her home. The floor in her house is dirt, and they have adapted their windows to protect from the cold, but she wants a better home for her family.\r\n\r\nJust as Lucila wants to improve her quality of life and that of her children, the other members also work for their loved ones. Don Roberto wants to invest in his taxi; Gabriel, Mauricio, and \u00c1ngel want to breed animals; and Cristina wants to invest in a repair shop.\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken next to Roberto's taxi. His taxi circulates in the country's capital, and not in the community where he lives.

She rears a cow, and sells its milk, earning INR 5,000 a month. She saves the entire amount with the goal of providing for her children\u2019s education. She has four children: a pre-schooler, two primary-school going children, and a teenager in secondary school. \r\n\r\nIn addition to running her small business, she is a diligent homemaker, exceptionally adept at balancing her family\u2019s finances. Using only her husband\u2019s income of INR 8,000 a month, she covers the living expenses for her family of seven and school costs for her four children. In stretching her finances thinly, though, she does end up compromising on some of her family\u2019s needs. She hopes to change this by achieving financial stability and improving their living conditions. Also, she is aware that her current savings cannot put four children through public college, which, she believes, will change their prospects for the better. \r\n\r\nSo, to earn more and achieve her goals, she has decided to grow her milk selling business into a full-fledged dairy microenterprise. In running her household on a tight budget, Parvatiben has, over the years, excelled at culinary skills like making yogurt, buttermilk, butter, and ghee (a rich clarified butter) from scratch for her family\u2019s needs. She now wants to make these products and sell them to her customers. In Gujarat, where Parvatiben lives, these dairy products are always in demand, so there will be no dearth of business. To put her plan into action, she needs more milk, and the cheapest way to source this is to buy another cow. \r\n\r\nShe formed the Sakhi Mahila Mandal, a joint liability group, to access the microfinance necessary to buy this cow. Her fellow borrowers are Amaraben and Ranjanben who want to grow their own rickshaw services, and Laxmiben and Bhavnaben who will scale up their clothes selling microenterprises. Together, they seek a loan of INR 80,000. Your timely loan will help Parvatiben capitalize on the spike in demand for dairy products during this auspicious festive and wedding season. Her enterprise will earn, on an average, an extra INR 7,000 per month. She is grateful for this opportunity and your support to achieve her hopes and goals for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":956.25,"image":{"id":1757932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Her business is the making and sale of fried chicken, which she makes in a room in a known avenue.  Her business has daily and constant customers, her sales are good because chicken is of high consumption in the area and the way she prepares it makes her business successful. \"Cooking the chicken well ensures the destruction of microorganisms, but one has to be careful to not overcook the chicken as the meat can dry out and lose it's vitamins...\" she commented.

The loan also helped him provide for his family's daily needs and expenditures.\r\n\r\nHe is very positive that he could improve his business more if you will let him borrow again in the amount of 20,000 PHP. This new loan will go to additional supplies of accessories and spare parts of his jeepney. Simultaneously, he could sustain the needs of his family if the unit is regularly maintained and in good condition.\r\n\r\nKarlo wants to buy another jeepney unit for his transportation business and he also desires to have an additional source of income like a variety store. He meets every week with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work, and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Su vida la comparte con sus hijos que a\u00fan no est\u00e1n en edad escolar y viven en una casa alquilada que cuenta con electricidad, agua potable y alcantarillado (sentada a la derecha, usa polera roja). La necesidad por darles un mejor futuro a sus hijos la hizo formar una banca de personas con negocios como; venta de productos cosm\u00e9ticos, venta de poleras, venta de mandiles, venta de chompas de alpaca, venta de polleras, venta de chamarras para ni\u00f1os y taller de soldadura, para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo y ampliar sus negocios.

She is single and has two children, ages 3 and 4. Her business is selling meat.\r\n\r\nShe is a good mother, gentle, caring, responsive, sincere, generous, understanding, responsible, and hard-working. Her business is located in the zone of the \"Plan 3000\" location, which has become a vigorous arm of production where microbusinesses in all areas, such as making clothing, design, and handicrafts, imitate foreign products that are sold in the principal local markets. The inhabitants of the populous area are in large part migrants from the western part of the country, as well as relocated miners and native groups from the area, such as the Ayoreos. It has a warm and very humid tropical climate, with a temperature that varies between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nDamaris has a dark complexion and long, tied-back black hair. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish because of general culture and for the business that she does. She shares her life with her children, who are not yet of school age, and they live in a rented house that has electricity, potable water, and sewer service. (She is seated on the right and is wearing a red shirt.) The need to give her children a better future led her to form a bank with people with businesses such as selling cosmetic products, selling t-shirts, selling aprons, selling alpaca sweaters, selling skirts, selling children's jackets, and a soldering workshop, in order to apply for a loan and expand their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling meat, which she does in a sales stall under a roof. She makes purchases directly from the town butcher. The cuts of beef such as sirloin steak, shanks, and butcher's roast are the favorites of the local customers in December. \"There are many families who choose fine cuts of meat to prepare in the oven, in casseroles, and, of course, roasted, as different alternatives to turkey, which some time ago stopped being the essential ingredient of end-of-year dinners,\" she comments. Her dream is to have a big butcher shop to sell wholesale and retail. She wants to make an investment in her business through the purchase of a meat freezer, in order to have a greater quantity of product on hand. This is her first sequence of loans with the institution in the five years that she has had this business.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Damaris is applying for a loan to purchase a freezer for meat in order to have a greater quantity of product to sell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":1753780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher
