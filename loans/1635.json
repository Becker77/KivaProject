She works as a seamstress and is also a kind, cheerful, optimistic, happy, good-natured, responsible, hard-working mother.  Her business is set up in \"Cotoca\", a small area of the city which is known for its typical food and crafts, especially ceramics.  The climate is warm, tropical and humid with a daily temperature ranging from 21-35 degrees Celsius all year round.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has a dark complexion, long chestnut hair and her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed.  She speaks Spanish because of her general culture and in her work (she is seated on the right in a blue top, wearing glasses).  She lives with her children who attend school.  They live in their own house with running water, electricity and a sewage system.  A need to improve her economic activity led her to join a communal bank with businesses such as construction materials sales, knitting of baby clothes, fried food sales, sporting clothes sales, a convenience store, butchery, sandwich sales and plaster crafs.  Her business is tailoring and she has her own sewing shop set up at home.  She makes alterations such as raising hems, altering waistlines, and other clothing alterations.  \"To line something, or not?  It depends on many things, such as the likes and customs of each person...\" she says.

These products give color to their own work, in the same way that Maria uses these colors to give a flourish to her own bags and wallets.  She sells her products to traders from other cities who sell her products on at a very good price.  \r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy toquilla straw and aniline for selling on.  She has been with the credit group since it started and she particularly likes the free medical care that it offers.  Her dreams are to be healthy and for her grandson to grow up to become a working professional."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1753883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy toquilla straw and aniline leather.

To earn a living she makes gaiters and hats. She is a good mother who is also enterprising, independent, responsible and hard-working.  \r\n\r\nShe runs her business from the 'Alto Chijini' area, which is well-known because it is located on a hillside of the city, where the streets are steep and the majority of the inhabitants are ex miners who were relocated from different places.  The climate is cold and dry and the temperature during the day goes between 2 and 14 degrees.  \r\n\r\nCristina is dark-skinned with long dark hair in plaits.  She speaks Aymara, which is her native language, but she also speaks Spanish.  She uses Spanish in her business.  \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her son who works and studies.  They live in a brick house with clean water, electricity and a gas supply which is currently being installed.  \r\n\r\nShe makes gaiters (woolen socks which come up to the knee) by hand and woolen hats.  She does this work every day independently in her own home.  She sells her products from a stall which she sets up in the street, as well as at the fair and markets.  Her products are popular by women who like to dress traditionally, because the gaiters offer warmth under their normal clothes.  She prepares hats for all people and they are used by both children and adults.  \"Woolen clothes are essential in this city because of the cold\" she tells us.  \r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a fixed stall so she doesn't have to sell her products on the street.  She wants to invest in her business by buying a sewing machine, which will help her to produce a greater quantity more quickly.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan she has asked for in the six years that she has been in this business.  She hopes that investing the money in this way will help her to work more efficiently and increase her

He makes a living selling stucco.\r\nHe is a good father and a great listener, and also generous, compassionate, supportive, patient, responsible, and hard-working. He works in the area of Alto San Pedro, known for its soup kitchens for the very poor. The weather is cold and dry, with temperatures of between 4 and 14 degrees Celsius during the day.\r\nRuben is dark-skinned, not very tall, and has short black hair. His mother tongue is Aymar\u00e1; he learned Spanish by hearing people speak it around him and by speaking with his customers. He lives happily with his spouse, who helps with his business, and with his baby boy, who does not help as much: he sleeps almost all day long! The family lives in a house of their own that has drinking water and electricity and is connected to the sewer system. He makes a living selling stucco, a fine-grained paste made of slaked lime (usually derived from fatty quicklime), ground marble, plaster, natural pigments and other ingredients. When the calcium hydroxide contained therein comes in contact with carbon dioxide, the material hardens. Stucco is mostly used to decorate walls and roofs. Ruben recently purchased a lorry to deliver the product to his customers. He tells us that thanks to his and his spouse's hard work, he has many customers, to whom he delivers stucco for all kinds of construction uses. His dream is to have a bigger business and more customers. He wants to buy stucco wholesale in order to meet increasing seasonal demand. He aims to sell to other villages as well. Ruben has been in business for two years, but this is his first loan with the field partner.\r\nHe asks for a loan to buy stucco wholesale and sell his products in villages far away."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1754447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy stucco wholesale to deliver and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":704.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":697.98},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":756.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":786.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":787.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":812.32},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":843.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":869.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":891.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":920.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":947.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":982.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.2},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.03},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.32},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":203.41,"local_amount":1402.81,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T11:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1405.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610554371},{"amount":109.67,"local_amount":756.35,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":757.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624226912},{"amount":114.06,"local_amount":786.63,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":788.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636214088},{"amount":114.19,"local_amount":787.51,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":789.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649564216},{"amount":118.38,"local_amount":816.42,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T13:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":818.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665046190},{"amount":121.71,"local_amount":839.37,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T13:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":841.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681344045},{"amount":126.13,"local_amount":869.86,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T13:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":871.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696554302},{"amount":542.45,"local_amount":3741.05,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3747.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711468454}],"funded_date":"2015-01-28T18:02:57Z","paid_date":"2015-09-17T14:26:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":813002,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelly contin\u00faa con su actividad de producci\u00f3n y venta de queso, en su localidad ubicada en cercan\u00edas al lago Titicaca.

Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad de \u2018Batallas\u2019 a una altura de 3735 metros sobre el nivel del mar, distante a 65 kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad. De clima frio y seco, con una temperatura que var\u00eda durante el d\u00eda entre 2-12 grados cent\u00edgrados.\nMarcelino es de tez morena, cabello negro corto, baja estatura, ojos obscuros, su lengua natal es el Aymar\u00e1 y utiliza el espa\u00f1ol para el comercio. Su rutina comienza desde muy tempranas horas de la madrugada, incluso antes de que los gallos anuncien la alborada, trabajar el insumo l\u00e1cteo hasta darle esa consistencia caracter\u00edstica, es una tradici\u00f3n que es compartida por gran parte de los habitantes. Con pocas ganancias y bastante esfuerzo, diariamente lucha para sacar sus productos frescos a la calle, son muchos los gastos que tiene que hacer para llegar al producto final. El proceso comienza con la leche reci\u00e9n orde\u00f1ada, los envases para almacenar el queso se elaboran con materiales de Totora, propia del lugar. \u201cEste trabajo nos da para vivir honradamente y sin lujos. Con lo que ganamos pagamos las cuentas, compramos comida y seguimos trabajando con el queso para comercializarlo, ahora ya tengo 25 a\u00f1os trabajando de manera intermitente\u2026\u201d comenta. El principal problema de Marcelino es la poca producci\u00f3n de leche, la \u00e9poca lluviosa fue muy corta y no ayud\u00f3 a que aumentara el pasto para alimentar a las vacas. Esto repercuti\u00f3 de manera directa en la obtenci\u00f3n de la leche, la provisi\u00f3n diaria es insuficiente para aumentar la producci\u00f3n de queso, dependiendo de la \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o, el pasto desmejora y esto merma la producci\u00f3n de leche. Su sue\u00f1o es mejorar su producci\u00f3n y llegar a otros mercados. \u00c9l desea realizar una inversi\u00f3n en su negocio mediante la compra de ganado lechero para aumentar su producci\u00f3n de leche y con eso la de Queso. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 25 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Marcelino solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de vacas lecheras, aumentar la producci\u00f3n de queso y llegar a nuevos mercados.\n","en":"Marcelino is a 49-year-old man, married, without children, and his business is making and selling artisan cheese.\r\n\r\nHe is a hardworking, simple, humble, honest, persevering, early-rising, punctual, enterprising, and very determined person.  His business is located in the Batallas locality at an altitude of 3735 meters above sea level, 65 kilometers away from the city. It has a cold and dry climate, with a temperature that varies from 2-12 degrees centigrade during the day.\r\n\r\nMarcelino is olive skinned, has short black hair, is of short stature, has dark eyes, his native language is Aymar\u00e1, and he uses Spanish for business.  His routine begins in the very early hours of the morning, even before the roosters announce the dawn. To work with dairy products until they give their characteristic consistency is a tradition that is shared by many of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWith little earnings and significant efforts, he fights daily to get his fresh products to the street. He has many expenses that he has to pay to get the final product. The process begins with recently milked milk, the containers to store the cheese are made from totora [a large reed], from that region. \"This work permits us to live honorably and without luxuries. With what we earn, we pay the bills, purchase food, and continue working with dairy production. The rainy season was very short and didn't help to grow the grass to feed the cows. This directly affected the milk production, the daily provision isn't enough to increase cheese production, depending on the season, the grass spoils and this reduces the milk production and, in turn, the cheese.\"  This is his first loan cycle in the 25 years he has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Marcelino asks for a loan to purchase dairy cows, increase his cheese production and reach new markets.

She began this work 10 years ago, and her great skill and creativity are evident in her crafts. Currently she has 4 private schools, 3 public schools and the snack bars in the I.C.E. (Costa Rican Electrical Institute) which order all sorts of foam and Fofucha decorations. These months are the high season since the teachers order for all the next year's events, graduation mementos and Christmas boxes for the students' party. For this reason she needs more raw material to be able to fill all the orders, so she asks for this loan. \r\n\r\nTatiana has very good references from her craft teacher; in the visit that was made, her great creativity and perfect finishing of the work she has done was verified.  When Tatiana was in school, repeating the 8th grade for the second time, a teacher recommended that her mother take her out of school because it wasn't possible for her to learn like the others and that she had another gift. It was from there that her mother enrolled her in the IPEC [Community Professional Education Institute]. She took various classes, but when she began to work with the foam, she loved it and from this moment, she used it for her different tasks.\r\n\r\nIt is important to stress that Tatiana will only use a part of this loan for this season, since at the beginning of the year she needs to invest in other sorts of materials that the teachers ask for.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 10 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Victor solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de telas, tapices y herramientas para renovar su negocio de tapicer\u00eda tradicional.\n","en":"Victor is 22, single, without children, and his business is traditional upholstery.\r\n\r\nHe is independent, enterprising, active, tenacious, and hard-working. His business is located in the \"El Tejar\" zone, an area characterized by informal businesses in all areas -- hundreds of businesspeople work side by side to offer clothing, food, meat, fruit, etc., in the cold and dry climate where the temperature varies between 5-15 degrees centigrade during the day and throughout the whole year. \r\n\r\nVictor is olive skinned, has short black hair, is of short stature, has dark eyes, his native language is Aymar\u00e1, and he speaks Spanish from school and for his business. He shares his life with his mother who lives with him in a brick house that belongs to the family, and has drinking water, electricity, and sewer services. His business is upholstery, work that he learned from his family. He works covering household, car, or motorcycle seats with fabric, tapestry or leather, attaching the material with tacks, staples or by sewing. \r\n\r\nHe also works improving the comfort of these items, installing springs, foam, or plant fibers in them. His primary objective in his work is to achieve comfort and beauty in the seats that he upholsters. The materials that he uses most are scissors, upholstery hammer, hand or pneumatic stapler, compressor, fabric chalk, sewing machine, small cat's claw to remove staples and tacks, rubber mallet, curved needles to sew by hand, large needle to attach buttons, punch, pliers, metric tape measure, square, and others. \"The upholsterer's tools are made up of a number of common tools and from other trades, very few specific tools, and some materials that serve to make almost anything possible...\" he says. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a larger business to serve a larger number of customers.

He works as a taxi driver and is enterprising, independent, generous, friendly, responsible and hard-working. He works in the town of Sacaba, Bolivia, which has a year-round temperate climate and is located in a rural area in which most people work in agriculture. Hundreds of fruit, vegetable and meat producers take their products to the town in order to sell them to wholesalers who then distribute them to markets, fairs and grocery stores.  \r\n\r\nAquiles is of medium height, with short black hair, dark eyes and tan skin. His native language is Quechua, which is widely spoken in this area, and he also speaks Spanish because of his level of education and his profession. He lives with a nephew who is in school and their house is currently under construction. It is made of brick and has electricity. Once a week a water truck passes by selling water by the liter, and residents buy this water for their personal water tanks or in large drums and bottles. A common problem is to miss the water truck and be left with no water for a whole week until it passes by again.\r\n\r\nAquiles' greatest dream is to see his house finished. He would like to install a system providing clean water for his kitchen, bathroom and washroom so that he does not have to buy water from the water truck. This is the first loan that Aquiles has taken out with Emprender [Kiva Field Partner] in the 14 years that he has worked as an independent taxi driver, and he will use the money to fulfill the goal stated above: providing clean water for his kitchen, bathroom and washroom so that he does not have to buy water from the truck.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1754601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

In search of a source of income for her family, Azimkan started a livestock breeding and crop farming business on her farm in 1971. Azimkan has 2 horses and 15 sheep on her farm. She also owns a 0.38 hectare plot of land and rents a 2.0 hectare plot of land on which she does crop farming. Her average monthly income is 25,000 som (KGS). This amount is not enough for a decent life for Azimkan and her family, which is why she turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for the further development of her farm. She is requesting a loan for 70,000 som (KGS) to buy a horse to increase the size of her herd. Azimkan plans to use the income from the loan for the further development of her business.

years old, a widow and a mother to 5 children. She has a secondary education. As the main source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 14 years ago with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 7,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Rahatai's hard work, she currently has 3 cows and 5 sheep on her farm. She also has a 0.91 hectare plot of land on which she grows peppers and alfalfa. Her average cumulative monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). This amount, however, is catastrophically not enough for a decent life. For the further development of her business, Rahatai turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to increase the size of her herd by buying 4 bull-calves. Rahatai plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also plants to save money for her eldest son's future wedding."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1780336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase four bull-calves for fattening up and reselling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulbahor village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-01-03T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.46,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahatai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T11:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":25030.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636161574},{"amount":425,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25030.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291137},{"amount":401.54,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25030.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":23.46,"payment_id":730933560}],"funded_date":"2015-01-05T23:27:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":815413,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is a hardworking entrepreneur who runs a seaweed plantation in the Philippines.

She and her family live in a small house in Lahore, and her husband earns a living by selling cooking oil. He stocks different varieties of oils such as almond, sunflower, coconut, apricot, and olive. They are used in cooking, massages and for hair. His small business doesn't allow him to save money, which is why he is often left with tight budget. In the hope of increasing sales, he wants to enhance his business by buying a larger variety of quality oils, because this will make his shop a more attractive place to shop. Shehnaz has therefore requested a loan to help her husband secure the money he needs to do this. They hope that the business will flourish and their standard of living will

This is a group of people who decided to band together and create a loan group, which has been a great help to them throughout their involvement in the group. The majority of the area's inhabitants work in agriculture and business in general. One of the group members is Marcy, who's 58 years old, married and has five adult children from this relationship, one of whom still lives in her home. Her husband doesn't work because of his age. She learned tailoring and garment-making years ago.\r\n\r\nMarcy is a very hard-working woman who likes to make her own way to push her family forward and several years ago she managed to set up a small tailoring workshop in her home where she makes all types of clothes. She makes the clothes for individual customer orders and also makes dresses for young girls that she sells in her shop. Also, she sells Avon products by catalogue (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories for women) She sells these products from her shop and additionally on certain days she travels around the area to sell. For over 15 years she has worked in this profession, and through it she has earned some income for the benefit of her family.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to purchase threads, fabrics, zippers, and Avon products. For 4 years she has been a member of the loan group and she likes it because the loans are really helping her. Her dream is to keep moving forward.

The canton is known for its vast forests and the beaches at Puerto Callo.  \r\nThe members of the group started the community bank to support their businesses and say that it has served them well for some time.  The majority of local people make their livings farming and operating small businesses.\r\nSra. Sixta, 60, is a member of the group.  Her husband died several years ago and she has 5 grown children, one of whom still lives with her.  \r\nDo\u00f1a Sixta has always taken good care of her family, but she is a businesswoman too.  She and her son have a fruits and vegetables business.  On weekends, she gets up very early and goes to the local wholesale market where she buys the produce that her son then goes on to resell.  The business has provided the family with a steady income for 10 years.

She also has a 1.60 hectare plot of land on which she grows beans for sale. Her average monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). However, this amount is catastrophically not enough for her family to have a decent life. This is why she turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for the further development of her business.

It's coordinated by Samaria, who is 38 years old, in a relationship and is a mother of six children, four of whom depend on her financially. She has worked selling fruit at the municipal marketplace for 15 years, and she pushed this business forward with hard work since she has some plots of land where she grows lemons and tamarinds.

","en":"Gulmira is 44 years old, married, and is a mother to four children. As the main source of income for her family, Gulmira has been raising cattle and crop farming for more than 15 years. Thanks to Gulmira's hard work, she currently has 3 cows and 6 sheeop on her farm. On her own 0.80 hectare plot of land and a 0.50 hectare plot of rented land she grows wheat and corn.

Yvette is a charming and enterprising woman who is raising a family and a company called Ojay Greene Ltd, with love and patience.  Yvette left the marketing world to start her own social enterprise, which aims to improve the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers in her community in Central Kenya. \r\n\r\nIn Kenya, 80% of produce sold in supermarkets comes from only 5% of the country\u2019s growers. Rural small-scale farmers cannot compete with larger producers because they lack the capital to transport and market their produce to more lucrative urban markets. This limits smallholder farmers to supplying informal markets; they are often forced to sell their produce to local brokers, or in open-air markets and kiosks, where they are typically paid below-market prices.\r\n  \r\nOjay Greene was formed to tackle this problem by producing and aggregating fresh produce from local farmers to sell directly to urban supermarkets. The company further addresses the huge deficit in basic skills among farmers by teaching them about food production and marketing. Training packages are also provided to help farmers adopt sustainable agricultural techniques that lead to better quality produce fit for urban supermarkets.\r\nYvette\u2019s business is still at an early stage, and she has many things to focus on, such as how to find money to operate her business and make it grow. She is now seeking a USD $25,000 loan investment from Kiva lenders. Yvette will use the money to pay for labor, technical assistance, supplies and costs to implement a pilot project that will source produce from 20,000 smallholder farmer suppliers within the next three years.\r\n\r\nYvette acknowledges that making Ojay Greene a success will be hard work. The company has recently partnered with Village Capital and Juhudi Kilimo to invest in smallholder supply chains and improve agricultural productivity and farmer livelihoods.  Yvette is excited about the partnership and the possibilities it brings.\r\n\r\nYour support for Ojay Greene will help smallholder farmers break the chain of reliance on brokers and informal markets. Through Ojay Greene, they will be able to access urban retail markets that offer much higher prices, giving them the potential to increase their income by as much as 50% and invest in the futures of their families. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":25000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1754437,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":3006,"youtubeId":"Sg4TNfiXHgY","title":"Kiva Borrower Ojay Greene Company  from Kenya","thumbnailImageId":1754437},"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to pay for a pilot project that will source produce from 20,000 smallholder farmer suppliers within the next three years.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":25000,"lender_count":654,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ojay Greene Company ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":25000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T17:03:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":812995,"name":"F3 Life Company Limited","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"F3 Life is a start-up that provides a unique credit solution to smallholder farmers in Kenya. When clients take a loan from F3 Life, the business helps them improve the management of their land  in a way which:\n\u2022\tbuilds soil fertility for generations to come\n\u2022\tprotects watersheds, rivers and lakes from pollution by fertilisers and pesticides\n\u2022\tremoves harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere \n\nAs farmers improve their land management, F3 Life rewards them with lower interest rates as well as higher credit limits.  Clients also receive farming advice which helps them boost their crop yields and farm incomes.  As we hope you can see, making a loan to this program is an investment in a farmer\u2019s business and an improved environment for people as well as wildlife. \n\nWorsening soil quality is a major threat to smallholder farmers. During the last 60 years, nearly one third of the world\u2019s arable farm land has been lost due to poor farming methods and continues to be lost at a rate of more than 10 million hectares per year. The United Nations estimates that soil erosion costs Kenyan farmers USD 400 million every year.  In less than 20 years, many Kenyan farmers will find they are cultivating land that cannot even produce sufficient crops to feed their families.  \n\nWith the help of F3 Life\u2019s environmental credit system and farming advice, their land will remain productive and profitable for generation after generation to come. F3 Life\u2019s model has been well received in the market. Its success to date has resulted in a strategic partnership with Juhudi Kilimo, a financial institution and Kiva Partner, which manages a loan portfolio of over 25,000 smallholder farmers. Juhudi Kilimo has offered its support to complete the pilot and scaling of F3 Life\u2019s green loan program. The partnership will bring many new growth and learning opportunities to F3 Life, as the company embarks on an exciting new phase of expansion. \n\nAdditionally, F3 Life is the recent winner of a global award for climate change finance innovation by the United Nations and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. Ltd for its approach in reducing the effect of climate change. \n\nF3 Life is now seeking USD $50,000 to fund its growing loan book and further develop its unique farmer management system. We hope that Kiva lenders will not only share our conviction in the importance of environmentally sustainable farming but will also be willing to join hands and walk with us on our journey.  By supporting F3 Life through a loan investment, you will be providing loan capital to address the unmet credit needs of smallholder farmers in Kenya. Additionally, you will support improved environmental management and recovering soil fertility, as well as training to increase farm productivity by an estimated 30% annually. \n\nF3 Life believes financial inclusion and education are critical for both poverty reduction and environmental conservation. F3 Life invites you to help us make a significant and sustainable difference to the lives of farmers and the quality of their land.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1754450,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":3007,"youtubeId":"FhrwxyXp2hI","title":"Kiva Borrower F3 Life Company from Kenya","thumbnailImageId":1754450},"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to fund its growing loan book and further develop its unique farmer management system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":50000,"lender_count":1343,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"F3 Life Company Limited","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":50000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T01:22:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":812996,"name":"Futurepump Company Limited","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Futurepump is a start-up producing solar-powered water pumps for irrigating small farms as an alternative to costly and polluting mechanical pumps. \n\nFood shortage is a recurrent problem in Kenya, affecting an estimated 10 million Kenyans per year. Food insecurities are largely driven by drought, with three droughts in the last decade and five drought-related national disasters declared in the past 20 years. \n\nLess than 2% of Kenya\u2019s agriculture is irrigated, making subsistence farmers especially vulnerable to drought. The only existing irrigation solutions made available to smallholder farmers are prohibitively expensive, typically costing farmers USD $2,800. They are also difficult to manage and maintain, and are thus unsuitable to address food security issues in Kenya. \n\nFuturepump is solving this problem by introducing the Sunflower pump. The Sunflower pump is a low-cost water pump designed to lift 13,000 litres of fresh water per day from underground reservoirs for irrigation purposes. The pump is both robust and portable and offers farmers a cheaper, cleaner and more sustainable alternative to costly and environmentally unfriendly diesel pumps.\n\nFuturepump\u2019s innovation has been very successful to date and has resulted in a strategic partnership with Juhudi Kilimo. Juhudi Kilimo, which manages a loan portfolio of 25,000 smallholder farmers, believes that the Sunflower pump is a high potential product that is ready for the market. This partnership will bring many new growth and learning opportunities to Futurepump, as the company embarks on an exciting new phase of expansion.\n\nThrough Juhudi Kilimo, Future Pump is requesting a USD $25,000 investment from Kiva lenders as loan capital to reach new markets and further develop their product. With your support, Futurepump is expected to broaden its distribution network to make the Sunflower pump available to smallholder farmers all over Kenya.\n\nIn the next three years, Futurepump expects to sell 47,000 units to rural smallholder farmers based in semi-arid and arid areas. The portable, solar-powered pump will save each farmer USD $117 per year in avoided fuel costs. \n\nYour support will help Futurepump and Juhudi Kilimo in empowering rural farmers with environmental-friendly solutions that bring immediate benefits, notably a substantial decrease in irrigation costs. Additionally, the Sunflower pump will give farmers the opportunity to grow and sell crops out of season, bringing economic gains to their families and the wider community. Juhudi Kilimo believes that financial inclusion and innovation are critical for poverty alleviation and environmental protection. You can help support Kenyan smallholder farmers and make a difference in their lives by supporting Futurepump in their quest to provide them with affordable modern technology.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":25000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1754457,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":3008,"youtubeId":"uQUX7xhlmto","title":"Kiva Borrower Futurepump Company from Kenya","thumbnailImageId":1754457},"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to raise loan capital to reach new markets and further develop their product","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":25000,"lender_count":616,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Futurepump Company Limited","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":25000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-21T09:03:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":806968,"name":"Ruzanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruzanna is from Vanadzor town, where she lives with her daughter.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, he plans to send his children to school.<br \/><br \/>With this loan, Joseph\u2019s Group members will purchase enough inputs to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land, and purchase a total of 11 solar lights."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1742661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light, and cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Teso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose C","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine C","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dankan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erikoo E","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wekesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phylis O","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emoit","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":120290,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120290}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-31T14:20:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":806942,"name":"Zahida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahida is a 34-year-old, married woman and mother of five children.

Yusufjon has been working as a driver for 10 years. He gets up early every morning to be on-time on his shuttle route. It is becoming difficult for Yusufjon to provide for his family and, thus, he tries to work more. He decided to replace his old shuttle bus with a new \"Sprinter\" one.

She is a smallholder farmer. She lives together with her husband in Iriga village, which is located in central Kenya. Their 10-year marriage has been blessed with two children, the youngest being  4 and the oldest 5 years old. They have managed to pay for their children to attend  school, so that they can focus on building a future of their own.Purity became a farmer in 2007, when she started making use of her husband's one-acre piece of land. She has grown the farmstead to a sustainable and profitable state. This unrelenting farmer is seeking a loan to further boost productivity. She is seeking a loan to purchase feed for her animals. The feeds that she plans to acquire have a well-proportioned nutritional content that will help improve animal health and boost milk production. On the farm, she has two dairy cows, eight poultry birds, and one dairy goat, and all of them will benefit directly from this loan.Purity was born second-to-last in a family of four children. She was promising, but her education was cut short in the first year of high school. Her passionate interest for farming took over, and today she makes a decent living by farming, to pay for her children's upkeep and education in boarding schools. She is so committed to the success of her farm that you will witness evidence of progressive techniques, like irrigation, on her farm. What also drives her is her love for animals. She named her cow 'Mwendwa,' which means 'loved one.'"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":418.34,"image":{"id":1753692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T20:30:08Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.68,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3244.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3339.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3436.76},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3537.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3640.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3746.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3856.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3969.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4085.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4204.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4327.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4453.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4584.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4718.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4855.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.79},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.02,"local_amount":6668.66,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6789.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824525},{"amount":80.37,"local_amount":7143.77,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":7273.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264791},{"amount":82.18,"local_amount":7305.01,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":7437.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459442},{"amount":84.5,"local_amount":7719.16,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7859.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.34,"payment_id":696587529},{"amount":90.59,"local_amount":8349.32,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":8500.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.34,"payment_id":731022654}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T00:36:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":812329,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello Lenders! Meet Janet, a modest and hard-working woman who has dedicated a large part of her life to the care of her children and farm. She resides with her handsome husband; together they are blessed with three lovely children. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 10 years and has never regretted or looked back. \r\n\r\nShe practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs and various varieties of food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. \r\n\r\nThe excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry; sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy, and green grams for protein. She believes that through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will get more output of poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit. \r\n\r\nThrough increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that could have been spent in buying fertilizer. Your loan will bring joy to her family because she will be able to support her family and improve her living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1753510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T20:30:08Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.64,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.2,"local_amount":3306.99,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3366.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264786},{"amount":17.19,"local_amount":1528.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459438},{"amount":34.19,"local_amount":3100.89,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3157.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.7,"payment_id":681377860},{"amount":35.49,"local_amount":3338.85,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3399.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.07,"payment_id":711505839},{"amount":95.29,"local_amount":8724.87,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8883.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.87,"payment_id":752110861}],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T14:43:32Z","paid_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":808572,"name":"Odai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Odai is a 21-year-old single man living in Jarash.

Kavita is married and has three children who all are studying in school. Her husband is a carpenter, but his income is not adequate to pay for the family's expenses, so she started her tailoring business 10 years ago. Now there is good demand, so she wants to improve her production. With the loan, she will buy a new sewing machine. She wants to be certain to please her clients and generate enough income to give a good education to her children, which is her ultimate dream. Along with Kavita, other group members are also requesting loans to improve their livelihoods. They are thankful to the investors for their kindness and generosity in providing capital for the loans.

He and his family's living conditions became disappointing and the farming income could not cover the family's expenses or the expenses of his sister's marriage preparation. However, Mohammad has never been a quitter; he decided to start a small fattening project as he has a suitable place in his house for that.

Her husband is a merchant.  <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Amparo works in retail so that she can get ahead and because she doesn\u2019t want her son to lack anything.  She has a provisions store in her house where she sells all types of products such as rice, sugar, oil, detergents, ice cream, and other items.  Amparo works every day from 6:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M., and sometimes much later.  Her son helps at the store when he is not busy.  Despite having this business only a year, Amparo keeps it well-stocked and has built up a large clientele, which helps the days pass by.  <br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to acquire more inventory for her store.  She will buy rice, sugar, sausages, detergents, and other basic necessity products.  Amparo has been with her Communal Bank from the beginning and enjoys being a member because the loans have helped her get ahead.  Her goals include continuing to expand her store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1752203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, sausages, detergents, and other basic necessity products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"24 de Mayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T20:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T20:50:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amparo Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1070.84,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":107.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":214.16,"processed_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-01-17T12:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":215,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":595162795},{"amount":322.5,"local_amount":321.24,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T11:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":322.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611785534},{"amount":214.98,"local_amount":214.16,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T11:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":214.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624232271},{"amount":214.98,"local_amount":214.16,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T12:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":214.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636218014},{"amount":107.54,"local_amount":107.12,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":107.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649569691}],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T08:42:07Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T12:41:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":814548,"name":"Jovencia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jovencia is 55 years old and is a married woman.
