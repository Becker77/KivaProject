During the last few months Sabah was unable to meet her customer's demands because they needed some products that she doesn't have such as bedding and curtains.

lives in an isolated community without access to the electric grid in Veracruz, the state with the third largest indigenous population in Mexico. He works in the field and cultivates oranges with which he makes his living and that of his family.  Despite his low income, he spends 20% of what he earns monthly in candles to light his house after the sunsets. This is around USD$27 per month invested in lightening of poor quality. Bartolome wants to buy a solar system to light his house at nights and give his children the opportunity to study for longer hours after school. The system would also provide enough light for his wife to cook more comfortably at nights. His investment will let him save some money after he pays the value of the system, which is very significant for his income\u00b4s economy.

Maria's husband lives in another country working hard so that his family can have a better life. She also works every day selling fruits and vegetables in the market. Maria has been saving some of the money she makes to build a proper home. She has been saving for the last year to build a roof on her house that is almost finished. She has managed to almost finish building her house, but to move in she needs to replace the bag that is currently working as a roof. She now needs a loan to finish paying for the materials and complete the home. Since she does not have a formal job and no way to prove her income, she does not have access to credit from other institutions.

from an agricultural institute, but she is an accomplished farmer from the Kerugoya area of Kenya and commands a lot of respect. \r\n\r\nShe is happily married, and together with her handsome husband, they are blessed with 2 children. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques. \r\n\r\nMercy has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices in the recent past have been going up. Mercy, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. \r\n\r\nSelling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. Mercy said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans, and their interest rate is low and is on a reducing basis. \r\n\r\nShe underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Mercy hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. \r\n\r\nThis loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":630.83,"image":{"id":1758322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-19T21:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-02T21:50:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":66800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4727.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4865.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5008},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5154.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5304.99},{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5460.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5619.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5783.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5952.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6126.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6305.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6490.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":115.03,"local_amount":10244.92,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10400.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824622},{"amount":56.78,"local_amount":5057.36,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5134.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264843},{"amount":54.39,"local_amount":4844.15,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4917.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601020},{"amount":60.83,"local_amount":5418.34,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5500.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459486},{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":5134.22,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5212.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.21,"payment_id":681377899},{"amount":59.11,"local_amount":5415.28,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5497.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.69,"payment_id":696587571},{"amount":61.27,"local_amount":5780.89,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5868.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.64,"payment_id":711505879},{"amount":70.65,"local_amount":6530.17,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6629.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.67,"payment_id":731022697},{"amount":84.51,"local_amount":7760.76,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7878.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.62,"payment_id":752110897}],"funded_date":"2014-12-20T01:36:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":815527,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma is 37 years old and married with one child who is in school.

Mother of three with an MBA, Beatrice has worked as an accountant, started her own catering company, and is the founder and headmaster of a primary school.  Beatrice started Rise to Shine (risetoshine.org) in 2011, a nursery and primary school located in fast growing Kigali suburb. Beginning with just one classroom for nursery students, Beatrice has grown the school every year by adding on another grade and classroom.\n\nIn June 2014, Rise to Shine received a grant to construct 4 new classrooms, which will allow Beatrice to nearly double her student capacity.

She couldn't attend school due to the orthodox beliefs of her family. But now things have changed in her community, and she knows all too well the integral role that education plays in shaping an individual. She is ready to put in as much effort as it takes to provide the best of education to her children. <br \/><br \/>To that end, Nayanaben seeks to grow her microenterprise. She wants to buy fast-selling items like salvar kameez sets, dupattas, scarves, and other locally favored garments in bulk, negotiating better rates with her suppliers. She also wants to add more variety to her inventory, so she can attract more customers. With these measures, she projects an increase of 50% in her monthly income, allowing her to more than double her monthly savings. <br \/><br \/>With the ongoing auspicious festive and wedding season in India, she is seeing a surge in demand from her customers. Right now would be an excellent time for Nayanaben to put her expansion plans into action instead of waiting months or years to save the capital first and then grow her business. So, together with her group members, she seeks a loan of Rs. 70,000. Maniben and Vasantiben also sell readymade garments, Anjuben caters ready meals through her tiffin service, and Kantaben rears livestock. Your timely loan will help them all reap sizeable profits by expanding their small businesses. <br \/><br \/>Lending a little will definitely help change the lives of Nayanaben, her family, and those of others in her group. This will be a pivotal step towards her goals of ensuring a good education for her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":843.75,"image":{"id":1757923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Sebastian has been a farmer and has raised cattle for 28 years. He learned from his parents how to cultivate basic grains and raise cattle, because they worked in this same activity. Since he liked it a lot he decided to work in it, too. To get to his workplace he travels almost 6 kilometers, and he works approximately 7 hours per day. This is his only job and with it he has moved his family ahead. He is requesting a loan to buy two milk producing cows to increase his milk and cheese production. With this he hopes to satisfy the great demand of dairy products in his area and take advantage of the relatively low price of the animals. Sebastian's dreams are to keep on working hard in what he likes. He would like to have his own dairy stand for sale. For his family he wishes that his children get a professional education where they can fulfill their objectives.

Gulnara has a secondary-specialized education. As the main source of income for her family, she has been farming since 1995. She started this business with 10,000 som (KGS). Gulnara has 5 cows, 2 horses and 20 sheep on her farm. She also has a 7.11 hectare plot of land on which she grows beets, clover and barley. Gulnara's organic produce is in high demand and brings in a good income of about 30,000 som (KGS).

Sri\u2019s husband works as a factory laborer. His monthly wage covers just enough for the family\u2019s needs, but it leaves them no money left for saving. Therefore, Sri and her husband are managing a small stall located in front of their house. They sell office stationery, drinks, and mobile phone airtime credits, and offer utility bill payment service. <br \/><br \/>Sri is the one who manages the stall on a daily basis. She started selling mobile airtime about six months ago when she met a Ruma field staff member who introduced her to Ruma. For the last three months, Sri has been performing well in providing mobile services in her community. She has the advantage to sell because her customers are mostly her neighbors who regularly come to her stall. <br \/><br \/>As the business runs, she needs working capital in order to process more transactions in her stall. Therefore, Sri is applying for a Kiva loan for the first time. <br \/><br \/>In the future, Sri plans to add more products to the things she sells, such as e-commerce for low-income communities. <br \/><br \/>In the photo, Sri is in her small stall with her son.

His willingness to improve was what brought him to be introduced to a Ruma field staff. He then decided to join as a Ruma agent. Now as the business runs, the number of mobile service transactions in his shop is increasing and he needs more working capital to fulfill it. Therefore, he hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva in order to process such transactions in his community. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Alex is the one who is wearing a green t-shirt, while holding a Ruma banner in front of his stall with a Ruma field staff who\u2019s wearing a grey hoodie.

Meet Susilawati, a micro entrepreneur who lives in North Bogor, a semi-urban city located about a two hours drive from Jakarta. She is happily married, and she and her husband have been blessed with three children. To support the family, Susilawati and her husband run a small stall that sells stationery, mobile phone airtime credits, and utility bill payment services. \r\n\r\nSusilawati started selling mobile airtime about nine months ago when she met a Ruma field staff who introduced her to Ruma. For the last three months, Sri has been performing well in providing mobile services in her community. She has an advantage to sell because her customers are mostly her neighbors who regularly come to her stall. \r\n\r\nAs the business grows, she needs more working capital in order to process more transactions in her stall. Therefore, Susilawati is applying for a Kiva loan for the first time. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Susilawati plans to add more products to the thing she sells, such as e-commerce for low income communities.

Meet Ahmad, one of Ruma's agents, who lives in North Bogor, a semi-urban city located about a two hours\u2019 drive from Jakarta. Ahmad is married, and he and his wife are blessed with a three-year-old son. His wife is a full-time housewife. He is a micro entrepreneur who runs a small shop that sells mobile phone accessories and airtime credits and provides a utility bill payment service. \r\n\r\nAbout nine months ago, Ahmad decided to join Ruma because he wanted to improve his small shop through the use of mobile technology and his entrepreneurial skills. Ahmad says that doing mobile airtime business with Ruma has been really helpful because he is now able to save more money for his son\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nAhmad is known as a friendly and hardworking person in his community, and that is why people regularly come to his shop when they need to buy mobile phone airtime or pay utility bills. As his business continues, the number of mobile service transactions increases, and he needs more working capital to fill the demand. Therefore, he hopes to get a working-capital loan from Kiva to process such transactions in his community. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Ahmad is sitting in his small shop. He thanks you for your support.

To get there, there is only one bus serving the route three times a day.  People in the community must be very attentive to the bus schedule if they need to travel to town.  Do\u00f1a Alicia who is the representative of the group, is 35 years old.  She is very kind but above all a very talkative, very outgoing woman.  She has been married for 17 years to Rogelio and together they have formed a family with five children, of which two are still studying primary education. Rogelio has been driving a taxi for the past three years.\r\n\r\nHe started in a car without taxi permits to move freely as a provider of this service which caused him many problems with other drivers. Rogelio longed for a vehicle with plates and authorization to work because it really is a good occupation.  He approached the government to request support and although the process was long, he finally got what he wanted. During the weekends, Rogelio has very good earnings, although he faces the constant increases in the price of gasoline. There are days that income is not as expected, but then he knows he can count on the support of his wife who raises chickens, turkeys and makes embroidery to sell and earn extra income to cover the costs of home crafts and education.\r\n\r\nThus, with team work they hope to realize their biggest dream which is to see their children achieve professional jobs. With the new loan they are requesting, Rogelio will maintain the taxi and buy two tires while Alicia will invest in their animals and crafts.  Alicia is very grateful to VisionFund and KIVA for the opportunity to get a loan because with it, they may invest in the taxi that is their fundamental working tool.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Elvira, who makes lamps and plaster figures; Carmen, Catalina and Rosalba who raise sheep.\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in the house of Alicia, who wears a black sweater. Also, you can see her husband's cab and some plaster figurines made by  Elvira."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1748279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to provide taxi service and buy two tires.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel La Labor, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2014-12-20T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-03T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":53000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10600},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":10600},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":10600},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":10600},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":10600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":730},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":730,"local_amount":10600,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10625.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980672},{"amount":730,"local_amount":10600,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10625.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423825},{"amount":730,"local_amount":10600,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10625.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769156},{"amount":679.49,"local_amount":9866.6,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9890.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763920},{"amount":736.57,"local_amount":10695.4,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":10721.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597474},{"amount":43.94,"local_amount":638,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":639.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682141135}],"funded_date":"2014-12-25T17:38:14Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:21:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce Bogner-Bohn","image":null}},{"id":823669,"name":"Crusenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Crusenia tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil divorciada, vive en casa de familiares junto a sus padres y su hijo en el distrito de Za\u00f1a, ubicado en la provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, en la costa norte de Per\u00fa.

Epifanio compra y vende los productos en la capital del pa\u00eds donde pasa la mayor parte del tiempo y s\u00f3lo regresa los fines de semana a su comunidad para estar al lado de su familia. Mientras tanto, Do\u00f1a Irene cuida a sus hijos y al llegar las vacaciones de la escuela ella acompa\u00f1a a su esposo para ayudarle en el negocio. \n\nLa pareja decidi\u00f3 iniciar la actividad por la falta de un empleo aunque las ganancias no eran extraordinarias, les ayudaban a solventar los gastos. Actualmente ya cuentan con un puesto fijo y m\u00e1s seguro aunque su gran reto siempre ha sido tener el dinero suficiente para invertir en m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda. Por lo anterior han recurrido a los pr\u00e9stamos de VisionFund. Siempre que reciben el dinero tratan de comprar lo que m\u00e1s les hace falta, esta vez necesitan m\u00e1s hilos, corta\u00fa\u00f1as, peines, agujas, cepillos, mo\u00f1os, pasadores, etc. \n\nYa son 8 a\u00f1os desde que Irene solicit\u00f3 su primer pr\u00e9stamo a la instituci\u00f3n y est\u00e1 muy agradecida porque gracias al apoyo pudo sacar adelante a sus hijos mayores aunque ahora su sue\u00f1o es que los tres que a\u00fan viven con ella puedan terminar una carrera profesional.\n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Do\u00f1a Celedonia y Aurora quienes invertir\u00e1n en la venta de jarcer\u00eda y pl\u00e1sticos; Leonor, en ropa; Edgar, en almohadads y Araceli, en art\u00edculos de bisuter\u00eda.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en las escaleras debajo del quiosco del municipio.

They have known each other for many years and so also are bound by friendship. The name was chosen because in the house where they meet, there is a plant by this name hanging on a part of the house giving a nice view.\r\n\r\nIrene is the caretaker of the plant.  She is 49 years old and has been married for 32 years to Epifanio.  Together have formed a family with eight children, three of whom still depend on them and are studying.\r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years, Irene and Epifanio sold haberdashery.  Epifanio buys and sells products in the capital where he spends most of the time and only comes back on weekends to their community to be next to his family. Meanwhile, Irene takes care of their children and during the school holidays, she accompanies her husband to help in the business.\r\n\r\nThe couple decided to start the business because of the lack of a jobs event though the income was not extraordinary.  It helped them to cover their expenses.  Currently, they already have a fixed location with more security but the greatest challenge has always been to have enough money to invest in more merchandise. Therefore they have requested loans VisionFund.  With the funds they have received, they try to buy what they need the most. This time, they need more wire, nail clippers, combs, needles, brushes, ribbons, pins, etc.\r\n\r\nIt has already been eight years since Irene requested the first loan to from institution and is very grateful and gives thanks for the support so that she could raise her older children but now her dream is that all three still living at home will have a career.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Aurora Celandine and who business is in selling containers and plastics; Leonor, clothes; Edgar, rugs; and Araceli, in imitation jewelery.\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken on the stairs below the kiosk of the municipality. Irene wears a white sweater and is the first to appear on the right hand

As a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Songa mbele \u201cmoving forward\u201d self-help group. For the past five years she has been actively involved in mixed farming, and because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and firewood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. This has not been a set back because Julia has been making great profits in farming. \r\n\r\nKerugoya is one of the places that has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming, that is good climate, soil, transport system, and markets. Julia has always wanted to diversify and start horticulture farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is a lack of funds to get the business off the ground. She is requesting a loan to start horticulture farming. Through Songa mbele self-help group where members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, she joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organisation that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan she intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes.

Meerbanbu has a 3.0 hectare plot of land on which she grows clover. She also has 2 cows, 15 sheep and 2 horses on her farm. Meerbanbu's average monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). However, this amount is catastrophically not enough for a decent life. Meerbanbu is very hardworking and responsible. She turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a 70,000 som (KGS) loan to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd.

Meet Salina, a farmer from a remote village in Barsombe in the Eldoret area of Kenya. She resides with her handsome husband with whom she is blessed with one beautiful child. Salina has been actively involved in farming for the last 12 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs, and various food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she is facing is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs.\r\n\r\nSalina is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She will use the excess maize she has to feed her poultry, and she will feed them sorghum to give them energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate into more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, Salina will increase her output of poultry meat, and this will also increase her income and profit margins. With increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. In addition to better profits, Salina is going to benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is a very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money by not having to buy fertilizer.\r\n\r\nYour loan will bring joy to this family because she will be able to support her family and improve her living

I took part in the Olympiad of Informatics in the city and in our region. I practiced as an informatics tutor with elementary school students and was active outside the classroom.

Since she was little, Gitanjali and her three siblings helped their mother by tending to customers. \"I remember when my mother was selling downtown and my older sister was the one who took care of us.\" Admiration and respect are what Gitanjali has for the two role models that she has in her life.\r\n\r\nSince she was 10 years old, Gitanjali has worked selling bada, idli, samosa and upma, using her mother's recipes. She sets up her stand under a roof that they have established and puts out a large table where she prepares the food. \r\n\r\nGitanjali uses the earnings she obtains to contribute to the household expenses, and to reinvest in the purchase of ingredients and supplies for her business. Gitanjali needs to stock up on more ingredients like chiles, onions, Maida, cream, beans, oil, flour, toothpicks, and gas, as sales increase with the start of the winter season. She wants to get ready to satisfy the needs of her customers, who come to her to buy because of the good flavors that she has. \r\n\r\nEvery day, Gitanjali thanks God for the great family that He has given her, as now her husband is currently helping her out with her business.

Her aunt taught her how to sew and she is thankful to her to this day.\r\n\r\nThe reason Shahnoza is requesting a loan is to buy a washing machine. She has never had one and always does her laundry by hand. It's now gotten very cold and it has become more and more difficult for her to get the laundry done. She has set herself a goal and wants to buy a washing machine as soon as possible. She promises to pay back the loan on time.
