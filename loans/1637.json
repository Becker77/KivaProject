Meet Coleta: she is a 57-year-old small-hold farmer based in Kerugoya, which is a small rural town in Central Kenya. Coleta and her husband have been blessed with lovely children.\r\n\r\nFor 20 years Coleta has been a mixed farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows maize, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity.\r\n\r\nBesides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular yet least exclusive hobby for women.

She is very passionate about poultry farming. The most enjoyable task to her is raising poultry. Ironically, she doesn't enjoy feeding cows. Having additional poultry on her farm will bring her untold joy. The hens will also increase the farm's egg production and thus increase sales volume. Agnes needs to increase her income to take care of her family's expenses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":583.92,"image":{"id":1758638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-20T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-03T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.97,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5904.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.8},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.42},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.6,"local_amount":10364.81,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10543.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824650},{"amount":53.78,"local_amount":4780.41,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4862.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264858},{"amount":51.63,"local_amount":4589.47,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4668.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601032},{"amount":56.61,"local_amount":5032.44,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5119.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459498},{"amount":58.65,"local_amount":5325.47,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5417.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.26,"payment_id":681377910},{"amount":53.78,"local_amount":4916.44,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5001.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.53,"payment_id":696587585},{"amount":60.04,"local_amount":5653.89,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5751.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.57,"payment_id":711505888},{"amount":121.86,"local_amount":11242.03,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11436.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.61,"payment_id":731022710}],"funded_date":"2014-12-30T03:08:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":815787,"name":"\u00d6zlem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u00d6zlem is married with one child.

First of all, the biodigester will allow him to displace the expensive and fossil-fuel-based LP gas he used to buy to cook and heat water, as well as chemical fertilizers. Indeed, by inputting his hogs' manure in the biodigester, the methanisation process will produce biogas and the bacteria will transform the remaining waste into nutrient-rich organic fertilizer. Not only will Gustavo's farm become a cleaner, more sustainable farm, but he will save money and increase his crops' yield in a natural way. Further, his wife, who had to collect wood in the surroundings to cook and was exposed to the toxic smoke on a daily basis, will now cook with clean biogas, which does not threaten her health. Their children will grow up in a place where waste is considered as a resource and live in harmony with their environment.\r\nThis loan represents 50% of the total cost of the biodigester, the remaining part being covered by a government subsidy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":545.34,"image":{"id":1758782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to invest in a 6 m3 waste-to-energy system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitlaltepec de Trinidad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":226,"posted_date":"2014-12-20T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-03T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.52,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gustavo Lorenzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11736,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11736}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-17T12:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610703933},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-22T12:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.7,"payment_id":696728690},{"amount":403.18,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6024.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.82,"payment_id":731164600}],"funded_date":"2014-12-21T06:04:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":815872,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is a maize farmer from Kwankwani village in Kaduna state.

Her business involves selling secondhand clothing.  She is a good mother who has a positive attitude.  She is also enterprising, sensible, sincere, optimistic, cheerful, responsible, and hardworking.  Juana conducts her business in the town of El Torno, a rural area where agricultural producers of meat, milk, vegetables, grains, and other products gather.  They sell to wholesale merchants and distributors who take these products and deliver them to different markets in the city.  This tropical area has a warm and humid climate.  The air temperature varies during the day between 21 and 35 degrees centigrade throughout the entire year.  <br \/><br \/>Juana has a dark complexion, long black curly hair, and a short stature.  Her native language is Guaran\u00ed and speaks Spanish in order to integrate herself into the general culture and to conduct business.  She shares her life with her children who are in school.  Juana lives in a rented brick house that receives electricity, running water, and sewage services.  Her business involves selling secondhand clothes.  These garments include trousers, belts, short-sleeved shirts, Bermuda shorts, and other items.  Juana works every day of the week by managing her retail stand at the open air market.  \u201cMy work begins by grouping together all of the clothes, shoes, accessory bags, belts, toys, and other items so that I can offer them to my customers,\u201d she says.

maintain her jeepney unit. She is glad that through her earnings she is able to send her children to school and meet their daily living expense. \r\n\r\nShe would now like to apply for another 8000 PHP loan which she will use to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney. It is very important that her jeepney is always in a good running condition to ensure continuous efficient service to her passengers. Part of the loan she will use to buy direct selling products to sell, which is her other business. She thanks God and you in advance for a good return on her investment and the financial help that will be given her for it will greatly help in sending her children to college. \r\n\r\nAlicia hopes to buy another unit in the future and grow her direct selling business. She prays for good health and a happy family.

Aunque a\u00fan se puede mejorar \"Si yo pudiera tener un equipo m\u00e1s grande, podr\u00eda abarcar el trabajo de dos municipios m\u00e1s\" y no pierde las esperanzas de lograrlo alg\u00fan d\u00eda. \n\nAdem\u00e1s, gracias a sus ganancias Emiliano ha podido mejorar su calidad de vida en cuanto alimentaci\u00f3n, calzado, su vivienda ha tenido cambios y lo mas importante, sus hijos contin\u00faan estudiando. Don Emiliano y Azucena quieren que sus hijos tengan una carrera profesional\n\n*La foto fue tomada en el negocio Don Emiliano y aparece un calendario que \u00e9l regala a sus mejores clientes*","en":"Emiliano is very cheerful, always in good spirits, and most of all is very friendly. He is 43 years old and is married to Azucena. Together they have a family with three children who are studying at college, high school and primary, respectively.\r\n\r\nEmiliano describes how for 16 years he worked as an employee at a print shop where he acquired a lot of experience, however,  he did not enjoy the working conditions \"I got tired of working as an employee, I knew that I could start a printing business but it would be difficult,\" said Emiliano. 9 years ago he set up his own business just designing logos because he did not yet have the right equipment, but soon after he used his earnings to buy his first screen printing machine. And so he began to make calendars, medical prescriptions, invitations, advertisements, screen-printed t-shirts, etc.\r\n\r\nChristmas and the new year are always the best time for business because all business order calendars. To take advantage of the season, he needs a loan to buy calendars with months already printed on them, then he only has to finish them off with the name of the business, its address and acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nEmiliano is very grateful for the loans that have helped him acquire more sophisticated equipment such as plotters, a new computer and dye sublimation equipment, allowing him to better serve his customers. Although he believes he can still improve: \"If I had a larger team, I could cover the work of two more districts\". He hopes to achieve that someday.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, thanks to his earnings Emiliano has improved his quality of life, in terms of food, shoes, his housing has undergone changes and most importantly, his children continue their studies. Emiliano and Azucena want their children to have a professional career.\r\n\r\n* This photo was taken at Emiliano's shop and he is shown holding a calendar that he gives to his best customers. *"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1782738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy calendars","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emiliano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":918.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":939.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":961.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":984.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1007.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1030.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1054.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1079.18},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1130.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1156.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1183.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1211.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1239.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.25},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.81},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.42},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.23},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.76},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":192.72,"local_amount":2820.29,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T14:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2859.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611980723},{"amount":153.31,"local_amount":2243.6,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624423874},{"amount":143.33,"local_amount":2097.51,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T13:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2126.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636769206},{"amount":227.78,"local_amount":3333.38,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3379.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649763964},{"amount":160.85,"local_amount":2353.9,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2386.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665597493},{"amount":147.01,"local_amount":2151.32,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2181.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":682140895}],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T06:49:38Z","paid_date":"2015-07-19T12:19:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jemma Ives","image":1373786}},{"id":816029,"name":"Adelaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelaida is thankful that she was granted a 19,000 PHP loan, which she used to buy materials needed in her tailoring business.

He is married to Perly and has four children. He manages their household while operating a business. They work hard to provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nAlberto owns and oversees operation of his jeepney service. He has one 14-16 person capacity jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. Most of the time, jeepneys are packed with passengers. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the second World War and are still to be seen throughout the Philippines in many colors and all over the place. Originally, jeepneys were old American jeeps. They were used in the war against the Japanese army, who occupied the Philippines for several years. After the Japanese army was defeated and the American military mission was completed, the jeeps were left by the tens of thousands on the islands of the Philippines.The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these jeeps about two meters longer and putting two long seats in them: one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses for cheap transport of people, goods, and even sometimes, little animals. Jeepney transport service is one of the stable businesses in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, Alberto is requesting a 16,000 Philippine peso loan, which he will use for repairs and maintenance of his jeepney. It is very important that his unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient service. His earnings from its service is their means of living. He is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given him.\r\n\r\nAlberto hopes that their transport service will continue to be successful. He dreams for his children to get the best education. Every week, he faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n*All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

","en":"Marhambi is a hardworking 45-year-old woman from the countryside.  Like many residents of her own district, the Farkhor district, she is involved in a typical rural activity - animal husbandry.  She has a barn at home, in which she keeps cattle.  With her sons' help, she has been raising cows and bulls for five years already.  Marhambi has a large family (she is the mother of six children).  The oldest four have already left school and essentially help their mother with the farming business.  At the moment, Marhambi plans to increase her cattle headcount, because the market price of cattle is currently quite low.

Thanks to this business he has been able to get where he is; while he doesn't have much he lives very happily with his family. <br \/><br \/>Jose is a hardworking and responsible man, and says he joined Fundacion Alternativa because the loans that they give out are according to what people really need. He went to a bank and they wanted to over-extend his credit - they gave him a lot of money, but he only wanted what he needed. Now with this small loan he will be able to plant two hectares of cacao so that he can diversify the products that he offers. Jose is very grateful that the institution listens and understands the small business, with which he will be able to improve his production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":1756199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She is from Nagarote, which is located in the western part of the country and known for its typical foods, such as quesillos, and its crafts, including clay flower pots, jars, ashtrays, etc.  Kenia is known as a very hard worker with a desire for self development.  She works hard to provide for her children.\r\n\r\nThanks to her determination to get ahead she runs a business selling home-cooked food.  Working from home, every day and on weekends she sells natacatamales (a typical food).  Her routine is to work 12 hours a day to serve both her steady and intermittent customers.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy food products such as rice, meat, chicken, vegetables, oil and other supplies such as soap, plates, cups, condiments, knapkins, etc.  This is so she can earn more profit in a not-too-distant future to support her children and give them better opportunities.  One of her dreams is to educate her children.\r\n\r\nKenia is grateful to Kiva lenders who help people with low incomes in poor countries like Nicaragua so they can have dignified work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":479.18,"image":{"id":1756194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy food ingredients such as rice, meat, chicken, vegetables, and supplies such as oil, soap, plates, cups, condimentos, napkins, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2014-12-21T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T07:40:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenia Sugey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.22,"local_amount":1284.01,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-28T10:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1305.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":610600786},{"amount":46.62,"local_amount":1215.99,"processed_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1236.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624460896},{"amount":53.78,"local_amount":1402.89,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636632143},{"amount":50.04,"local_amount":1305.52,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-18T11:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1327.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649612398},{"amount":3.9,"local_amount":101.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":103.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681390023},{"amount":44.07,"local_amount":1149.71,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1169.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696600362},{"amount":20.07,"local_amount":523.49,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":532.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711519796},{"amount":211.48,"local_amount":5516.72,"processed_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5610.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752310012}],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T22:07:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":823785,"name":"Nargiza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A woman by the name of Nargiza is very hardworking and smart.

She is single and has has three children who are 17, 7, and 5 years old. She has a business making and selling homemade bread. She is sensitive, sincere, generous, understanding, responsible and hardworking. Her business is in the \"Plan 3000\" area, known for being the most populated neighbourhood of the city. It is also known for commerce, conducted by the descendants of immigrants from different ethnic groups of the region such as the \"Ayoreos\" and miners who relocated from the east. It has a warm, tropical and humid climate with a constant temperature of 30 degrees centigrade throughout the year. \r\n\r\nRoxana is of short stature and has a dark complexion. She keeps her long black hair tied back. Her first language is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish for general culture and for her business activities. She lives in her parents home with her children. The eldest two children go to school and the youngest still stays home. She lives in a brick home and they have potable water, electricity and sewerage.\r\n\r\nRoxana's business is making and selling homemade breads, including \"mollete\" (an everyday bread made with flour, granulated sugar and butter), rice bread (bread made with rice flour), sweet bread (one uses raisins, eggs, milk and sugar to prepare it), corn doughnuts (made with corn), tortilla (this is bread dough which is rolled out, sprinkled with sugar and flour, then folded, and the process is repeated many times, yielding a sort of puff pastry after baking). Roxana makes the bread in a specially-equipped room for baking at her home. \"The need to have my own business led me to open my bakery, which leaves me with free time to look after my children,\" says Roxana.

Two of his children attend school. He has farmed for fifteen years and will use the loan from Kiva to buy fertilizers to grow maize, which he will then sell. The profits from the business will be used to pay his employees.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

John is forty years old and works tirelessly to raise animals. Through these humble tasks, he aspires to offer all of his children a university education. \r\n\r\nJohn learned to do farm work at a young age, thanks to his parents. He has a tiny plot of land to live off \u2013 just under half an acre \u2013 and has always struggled to support his family. John has developed the farm in the sloping, undulating terrain by successfully adopting suitable soil and water conservation methods such as stone pitched bench terracing and digging rain water storage pits. For over five years, his income source has been from selling milk, poultry, and vegetables. He supplements the meager income by doing other personal business. \r\n\r\nJohn passionately loves dairy farming. Milking and feeding his own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. He is very appreciative that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in his village. Milk, poultry and vegetables are very perishable, and these products require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that he faces is delivering to the market on time. \r\n\r\nEldoret area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why John is kindly seeking a loan to buy another motorbike. Farmers like John will use the motorbike to transport passengers and farm goods to and from the market. They are suited for areas with poor road networks which are inaccessible by cars. They are also very cheap to acquire and maintain. John is full of hope.

Since then, their farm and family have grown in more ways than one. In 2008, the couple started working on a run-down farm. Today, they are making money off the poultry and dairy animals they raise and also the maize and vegetables they grow. Michael has further invested in transportation services to reduce their transportation costs and to make money by offering the service to other farmers. Michael loves to dairy farm, especially since it was always a life goal of his to be a farmer. His wife understands this, and together they joined hearts and hands to make the farm successful. Michael is seeking a loan to purchase a pedigree dairy cow. There are more than 100 cattle breeds in Kenya. However, not all are good producers of milk. In fact, very few are. Cattle aside, the tastes and preferences of milk buyers in the market are really growing diverse in Kenya. Consuming milk is no longer a matter of pouring it into our cereal bowl, adding it to our coffee, or drinking it straight from the glass: we now have preferences in the type of milk we drink. Today, milk consumers are spoiled for choice: in the market, we have old-fashioned cow\u2019s milk and lactose-free milk, not to mention non-dairy options such as soy, almond, rice, and coconut milk. It takes dairy masters like Michael to see these shifts in the market and adopt ingenious techniques in farming to ensure that the qualities of their product adapt to the changes in consumer preference. Purchasing a pedigree cow shows how Michael is keen on controlling lameness levels in his dairy cattle. He considers breeding to be the core of his overall strategy of ensuring that milk quantity is way above average and that the milk quality is second to none in the market. He anticipates that feeding will be his highest milk production cost. This, to him, is acceptable because to get cows that milk well and remain healthy, they have to be fed properly. Your loan will make a significant difference to Michael\u2019s farm profitability. The couple will use the returns from this investment to pay for the loan, pay for their children\u2019s education, and then reinvest in the business. It has always been their ambition to share their passion about farming with their family. They hope that their kids will be thrilled to join the business of running the family farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":671.43,"image":{"id":1784547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a pedigree cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.39,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4832.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4973.23},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5268.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5422.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5580.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5743.68},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6084.3},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6262.12},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6445.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6633.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.21,"local_amount":10942.59,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":11272.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262708},{"amount":59.3,"local_amount":5224.46,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5381.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264890},{"amount":59.87,"local_amount":5274.1,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5432.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601063},{"amount":127.41,"local_amount":11425.39,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":11769.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.28,"payment_id":681377937},{"amount":64.16,"local_amount":5792.72,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5967.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":696587611},{"amount":66.9,"local_amount":6221.03,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":6408.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.72,"payment_id":711505917},{"amount":73.82,"local_amount":6725.13,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6927.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.52,"payment_id":731022739},{"amount":83.37,"local_amount":7545.3,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7772.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.28,"payment_id":752110931}],"funded_date":"2015-02-04T13:43:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joan Parks","image":null}},{"id":814189,"name":"Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Javier es un hombre de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, soltero, tiene 2 hijos, y trabaja como soldador de construcci\u00f3n.\n\u00c9l es buen padre, honesto, responsable, activo, constante, trabajador.

There's so much opportunity stretched out in front of us: opportunities to finally live up to our full potential at the farms.\" says Erick. At a time when many farmers in Kenya are abandoning dairy farming and agriculture owing to poor yield and low income, Erick, hailing from Litein, is scripting a success story with his dairy farming. He is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his children as a primary caregiver. For the past five years, he has been involved in mixed farming, and his primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, and tomatoes and keeping dairy cows. Erick has been able to provide nutritious food for his family. After he lost his formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family has been overwhelming because of the responsibility of feeding the whole family. This challenge has not made him give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" he said. Erick is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow and to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy cow that he plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. The profit from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase his business enterprise. Erick is very visionary, and he intends that in the near future, he will start adding value to his milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. He will also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure his family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, he will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets. Erick believes that if smallholder farmers had the same access to resources as large scale farmers, the number of the world's hungry could be reduced by half.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1784622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow and build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":230000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9225.48},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9495.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9772.59},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10058.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10352.14},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10654.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10966.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11286.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11616.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11955.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12305.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12664.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":13035.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":13416.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13808.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14211.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14626.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15054.46},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15494.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.27},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.52},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.13},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.13},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.09},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.56},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.91},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy McElroy","image":1095702}},{"id":823868,"name":"Ebru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ebru is single.
