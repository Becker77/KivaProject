He is 25 years old and in his fifth year of studying English at one of the universities in his country.  He is single, has no children and lives with his parents.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Harouna Doro started a small business selling clothing to the students on his faculty.  He is also studying topography.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan for Harouna Doro, from the field partner, UIMCEC.  He conducts his business during the academic year and the profit that he makes has helped to pay for the costs associated with his studies.  He would like to study further abroad, and then become a successful businessman.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, he would like to buy a photocopier and printer to improve his profits.  If he is able to increase his working capital enough, he would like to begin also selling fruit, as his analysis has shown that this should make him a further profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1785217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.79,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harouna Doro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14.92,"local_amount":7716.11,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T14:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8472.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.51,"payment_id":624411976},{"amount":16.13,"local_amount":8206.85,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T12:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9011.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.28,"payment_id":636760386},{"amount":68.16,"local_amount":34077.04,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T16:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":37419.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649751198}],"funded_date":"2015-01-05T20:09:28Z","paid_date":"2015-05-17T16:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Ryder","image":1886035}},{"id":816121,"name":"Madilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madilyn is 36 years old and married with two children.\r\n\r\nMadilyn works hard to provide for her family.

To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Nyamira area is very populated and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, Jenifer finds poultry farming very enjoyable. Her biggest challenge is meeting the high demand. \r\n\r\nJenifer lacks funds to increase her poultry farming and requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 30,000 KES, which she will use to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through Juhudi Kilimo, she is able to buy more poultry. With the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, which will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets. The extra income will be used to permanently change her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225.96,"image":{"id":1784828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.44,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.85,"local_amount":2644,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2799.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264892},{"amount":25.98,"local_amount":2227.17,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2358.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601064},{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":2192.17,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2320.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459528},{"amount":27.21,"local_amount":2374.37,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2513.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.49,"payment_id":681377938},{"amount":26.17,"local_amount":2298.91,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2433.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.65,"payment_id":696587613},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":2412.88,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2554.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.49,"payment_id":711505918},{"amount":28.97,"local_amount":2567.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2718.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.99,"payment_id":731022741},{"amount":30.1,"local_amount":2650.63,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2806.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.82,"payment_id":752110932}],"funded_date":"2015-01-06T08:31:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":823974,"name":"Amable Grimaneza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grimaneza tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad es soltera tiene 3 hijos es una persona humilde que vive en San Miguel en la Provincia de Bolivar en la comunidad Salado chico, pertenece a la comunidad San Francisco 2.\nElla se dedica a la agricultura hace algunos a\u00f1os con esta actividad mantiene a sus tres hijos, solicita el credito para la compra de insumos, fertilizantes y semilla para sembrar maiz, gracias a este credito podra mejorar la produccion de los sembrios.

It all started at the age of 21 when she decided to learn fashion design and tailoring. She proved to be a smart learner, excelled at it, and was recruited to a well-known fashion-design atelier in Beirut. <br \/><br \/>Being the proud mother of 5 daughters, she had to put her career and dreams on hold for a long time till she met Al Majmoua, who revived her dreams and helped her set-up her own atelier. <br \/><br \/>This was 12 years ago... Since then, Al Majmoua and Layla have been working hand in hand and her business has been growing allowing her to proudly sustain the needs of her family but also create jobs for 3 women tailors.  <br \/><br \/>Layla was selected to be one of 6 women entrepreneurs who displayed their collection in a fashion show that was held in December 2007, in the framework of the Women Micro Entrepreneurs and the World of Fashion project funded by Save the Children, which benefited 300 women tailors, as the outcome of a one year intensive preparation. The work of these amazing beneficiaries was recognized by Fashion TV Arabia who offered media coverage for this event.<br \/><br \/>Layla was also selected by PlaNet Finance Foundation as the \u201cMicro-Entrepreneur of Honor\u201d for the year 2014. She was supposed to receive her award during the 4th edition of the PlaNet Finance Foundation gala dinner which was organized under the auspices of the Cannes Film Festival with the objective of raising 200,000 Euros for the co-financing of programs in the field in order to help women entrepreneurs in Lebanon, Benin, Brazil, Egypt, France, Ghana, Madagascar, Morocco and elsewhere. The gala dinner was followed by an exclusive live auction conducted by the Artcurial Auction House. <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, her husband\u2019s health was very critical, so she decided to stay next to him during his remaining few days and couldn\u2019t attend the event. He passed away leaving her alone again with her five daughters and successful career to move on. <br \/><br \/>With strength and determination, Layla succeeded in providing better standards of living to her 5 daughters and as well as 3 women dressmakers through the creation of job opportunities. She had the chance to contribute to her daughters\u2019 wedding expenses, in addition to urgent medical needs. <br \/><br \/>Layla has acquired a wide experience in this domain with her greatest features being evening gowns and wedding dresses.<br \/><br \/>Today, Layla is acquiring her eleventh loan cycle from Kiva\u2019s field partner Al Majmoua in order to buy necessary fabrics, textiles and accessories requested for her new designs, especially for the autumn and winter collection and the Holy Christmas and New Year seasons.<br \/><br \/>Respected and trusted by all, Layla naturally became a role model and peer trainer for other female micro-entrepreneur beneficiaries of the Al Majmoua program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3338,"image":{"id":1755031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Growing

is a freshman at the American University of Central Asia. Here is her story:\n\n\u201cI had a happy childhood with my family. I loved the evenings when all the members of our family used to gather and had a dinner together, discussed news and watched TV. Everything got worst with the death of my father, when I was seven years old.\n\n\"I live with my mother and two brothers. My mother is a dentist in our village. She has as little as 180 dollars per month salary. My elder brother is 20-year-old. He hadn\u2019t studied at the university because of the financial situation of my family. He used to do different jobs requiring no special skills in order to help mother somehow. My younger sibling goes to school; he loves math and dancing.\n\n\"I studied well at school. Since I have been at elementary school, I have tried to participate in all social events within the school and out of it. I used to be a presenter, so loved to talk and share my opinion with others. Thanks to my social activity and good academic performances, I won the full AUCA scholarship for AUCA\u2019s one-year-study at Preparatory Program. 70 students had received such a scholarship, lived in the dormitory and had free meals. It was a great experience for me as I hadn\u2019t lived far from my family and hadn\u2019t seen so much cultural diversity before. That year was full of fun and academic achievements for me. I began to feel myself at home in AUCA and wanted this moment to last. Now I am a freshman and, unfortunately, my family is not able to cover the tuition fees fully. I hope to get a Kiva loan, so that I can concentrate on my studies rather than thinking about finance.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.64,"image":{"id":1758352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

years ago, Nancy started farming on a small, inherited piece of land, in Siongiroi, a remote village town in the Rift valley area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs, maize, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to Nancy's heart and, every day, she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. \r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Nancy will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions, such as rain. \r\n\r\nNancy believes that, through this loan, her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

He lives with his wife, two children, and his sick, aged mother. He used to work as a tailor but he did not have many customers and the income could not cover his family's expenses.

She is a skilled seamstress and makes a living selling her sewing services. \r\n\r\nFlor went to work at 18 as a seamstress in a shop.  She branched out later and now, at 52, has her own workshop with one direct employee.  She works every day and specializes in shirts and pants for uniforms.  Her earnings and her husband's cover the family's expenses.  Flor is applying for a loan that she will use to buy a specialist sewing machine that will allow her to expand the sewing services she delivers.  The investment will allow her to attract new customers and grow her small business.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Flor wants to increase her output and create new employment opportunities for others.  Her hope is that she can provide a better standard of living for not only her own family, but also the families of those she employs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1756327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a specialist sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Marinilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-12-21T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T18:00:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":55.09,"local_amount":132221,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":132681.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611815668},{"amount":441.77,"local_amount":1067779,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1071494.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.14,"payment_id":624865249}],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T16:12:02Z","paid_date":"2015-03-19T10:33:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":816157,"name":"Ran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ran\u2019s Group lives in a rural village in Battambang province in Cambodia. \r\n\r\nTo help support her family, Ran works as a farmer and does extra work as a teacher. \r\n\r\nIn her village there is no reliable access to safe and clean drinking water.

Its name is made up of two words, \u201cunion\u201d [union] for having consolidated the group and \u201cpesquera\u201d [fishery] because five of its members; Yuliana, In\u00e9s, Juana, Abraham, and Esteban sell \u2018mojarra\u2019 [a type of fish].  Arely sells desserts, and Mar\u00eda Esther sells chicken.\r\n\r\nAbraham is the youngest of his siblings.  His parents have been fishing for and selling mojarra for 30 years.  They have been Abraham\u2019s teachers, and he has engaged in this business activity for three years.  He remembers his parents working as a team ever since he was a boy, and this is his greatest inspiration.\r\n\r\nThis is Abraham\u2019s second loan.  The extra money has allowed him to buy more material to improve his business activity.  He bought things like new nets, a refrigerator, and a motorcycle to get to the different communities when it is time to sell the fish.\r\n\r\nWith the new loan Abraham wants to buy more fish because he already has an order for 60 kilos for the end of the year.  The order is important, and in spite of going out to fish daily, he plans to buy what he does not have in order to not let down his customers.\r\n\r\nAbraham says that what he likes the most about his business activity is getting into the lake with the boat that his parents gave him.  \u201cThe biggest mojarra that I caught weighed almost two kilos.

With the aid of her hard-working husband, Wiliter also raises poultry and grows maize, among other crops. Wiliter is seeking a loan of KES 50,000 for constructing a cowshed. She plans to put up a well-designed barn that will provide a clean, comfortable home for her herd and a pleasant, efficient workplace for her. ITo increase milk production, the cowshed will provide a favorable environment for the cows. With your loan, Wiliter has carefully planned for the storage and handling of milk, feed, bedding and manure, as these account for most of the labor in any dairy farm. The housing will have a plentiful, dependable supply of good water, made available 24 hours a day. The income she will make from this investment will put her in a position to comfortably afford increasing farming costs.

Pakistan. Her husband has been running a general store in which he sells rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap, biscuits, etc. He manages his household necessities from his own store as well. He has some relatives who would like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with a monotonous tone which is impressive, and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up very good relationships with his customers. \r\n\r\nHis general store is very famous in the town; that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relations, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Azra requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more sacks of rice for his general store. Azra thanks Kiva and field partner BRAC

Ahora que el invierno se acerca, la temperatura realmente desciende y los cerros se cubren de neblina, pero el calor est\u00e1 en los hogares de las familias reunidas para celebrar juntos las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o. \n\nLos integrantes de la asociaci\u00f3n son personas muy trabajadoras, siempre est\u00e1n dispuestos hacer lo posible para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de sus familias. Miguel \u00c1ngel, uno de los  miembros, se caracteriza por su buen humor y amabilidad, tiene 27 a\u00f1os, es soltero y vive con su mam\u00e1 quien depende econ\u00f3micamente de \u00e9l. Para cubrir los gastos de su casa, desde hace 10 a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a vender tambos azules que compra en el estado de Quer\u00e9taro (a 4 horas de donde \u00e9l vive) en una f\u00e1brica de jabones; los tambos forman parte del material que ya no se utiliza en la f\u00e1brica y los adquiere a un menor precio.\n\nPara vender este material de reciclaje, Miguel viaja hasta el estado de Michoac\u00e1n, tambi\u00e9n a 4 horas de distancia de su hogar, donde permanece tres o cuatro d\u00edas a la semana; cuando casi casi ha vendido toda la mercanc\u00eda regresa a la zona industrial para comprar m\u00e1s tambos y seguir ofreciendo variedad. Miguel inici\u00f3 con esta actividad porque trabaj\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os con un se\u00f1or que se dedicaba a lo mismo, not\u00f3 que era un buen negocio y decidi\u00f3 seguir por su cuenta. Lo logr\u00f3 gracias al primer pr\u00e9stamo de VisionFund que le facilit\u00f3 comprar los primeros tambos y ahora cada que termina de pagar un cr\u00e9dito, solicita uno m\u00e1s, como en este caso que invertir\u00e1 para comprar m\u00e1s tinacos y para hacer algunos arreglos a su camioneta que utiliza para trasladarlos. \n\nEl mayor anhelo de Miguel es expandir su negocio y poder ofrecer empleo a otros j\u00f3venes en su comunidad, tal como \u00e9l inici\u00f3. \n\nLos dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Tania quien invertir\u00e1 en alfarer\u00eda; Ma Guadalupe, en su est\u00e9tica; Anahi, en su papeler\u00eda; Beatriz, en venta de producto l\u00e1cteo; Blanca, en su molino y Guadalupe, en la venta de perfumes.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el jard\u00edn del municipio, los integrantes del grupo estaban muy emocionados porque por primera vez hab\u00edan viajado hasta el centro, normalmente todos sus tr\u00e1mites se realizaban en su comunidad.\n\n","en":"The community where the loan group \u201cSan Juanico el Alto\u201d is located, is surrounded by enormous hills with green fields. Now that winter is approaching, temperatures descend a lot, and the hills become covered in mist, but the warmth is in the homes of the families gathered together to celebrate the festivities of the end of the year.\r\nThe members of the group are hard-working people, they are always prepared to do whatever possible to improve their quality of life, and of their families. Miguel \u00c1ngel, one of the members, is known for his good humor and his kindness. He is 27 years old, single, and lives with his mother, who depends on him economically. To cover household expenses, for 10 years he has made a living selling blue barrels (tambos), which he buys in the state of Quer\u00e9taro (4 hours away from where he lives) in a soap factory. These barrels are part of the materials that are no longer used in the factory, and he gets them at a lower price. \r\nTo sell this recycling material, Miguel travels to the state of Michoac\u00e1n, also 4 hours away from his home, where he stays three or four days a week. When he has sold almost all of his merchandise, he returns to the industrial area to buy more barrels and keep offering variety. Miguel began this occupation because he worked for two years with a man who did the same work. He realized it was a good business, and decided to do it on his own. He was able to do it thanks to a first loan from VisionFund, which made it easy for him to buy the first barrels. Now, every time he finishes paying back a loan, he asks for a new one. In this case he will buy more water deposit tanks, and make some repairs to the pickup truck he uses for transfers. \r\nMiguel\u2019s biggest desire is to expand his business and be able to offer employment to other young people in his community, in the same way that he started. \r\nThe other members of the group are Tania, who will invest in pottery; Ma. Guadalupe, in her beauty shop; Anahi, in her stationery store; Beatriz, selling dairy products; Blanca, in her milling business; and Guadalupe, selling perfumes. \r\n*The photograph was taken in the garden of the municipality, the members of the group were very excited because it was the first time they had traveled to the center, usually they made all the procedures in their community.

is 42, married and the father of four children. He runs a lathe machine shop in Karachi. He uses the lathe machine for shaping pieces of metal, by causing the work piece to be held and rotated by the lathe while a tool bit is advanced into the work, causing the cutting action. He has become more skillful over time. His work requires time and attention. Due to constant wear and tear, his lathe machine is not working properly, wasting time and precious earnings.

To support her family\u2019s meager income, she set up a photo studio. Due to her hard work and business acumen, it has grown. Her photo studio now contributes significantly to over 50% of her family\u2019s monthly earnings. \n\nDevalben, however, realizes that to provide adequately for their later years, as she and her husband age, they will need more than the Rs. 15,000 that now comes in. Her family also includes a young pre-school aged child. As she did not have the opportunity to go to school, she understands too well how it limited the opportunities to uplift her family from poverty. So she wants to leave some savings behind, contributing towards the child\u2019s further education. \n\nTo make all these hopes a reality, Devalben needs to earn more through her small-scale business. For the further growth of her photo studio microenterprise, she needs to invest in a computer. With the help of technology, she will be able to provide a wider array of photographic services, which will also command a higher price, and, thereby, result in an increased income. She will also be able to service more customers, as she will be able to provide services in a shorter turnaround. \n\nTo source the capital for this investment in computerizing her photo shop, Devalben formed a group with four other enterprising women: Valbai, who runs a petty shop; Manbai, who makes and sells \"papads,\" a local snack; Ganga, a tailor; and Mina, who sells accessories locally known as \"cutlery.\" Devalben and her group members are entrepreneurial and hardworking, but lack capital to expand their ventures, so they need a loan of Rs. 75,000.

resident of Surendranagar district in the state of Gujarat. She runs a small animal husbandry microenterprise. Her small-scale business forms the bedrock of support for her family of five that also includes three school-going children. Besides being a regular source of income, the milk and by-products of the animal produce are an important source of nutrition for her growing children. \n\nDespite the good run she has experienced with her venture, Jashuben\u2019s position is rather precarious. With just a little over Rs. 4000 in monthly savings, her family is constantly at risk of falling into financial strain. Even a common fever is enough to wipe out her monthly savings. Sensing that she must do something to increase her savings for a rainy day and to give her children a complete education, Jashuben is keen on expanding her small-scale business with the help of a loan. The loan, granted on reasonable rates, will give her the opportunity she needs to quickly scale up the size of her business.\n\nThe lives and stories of Sonalben and Sajuben mirror that of Jashuben, and the three women share a longstanding friendship, running their own animal husbandry microenterprises that they seek to grow. Rupaben and Anuben, the two other women in the group, run sewing businesses. Together, these five women seek to crowdfund a microloan of Rs. 69,000. Your loan will help Jashuben and her group to scale up their businesses quickly without getting ensnared in a debt trap. A year from today, their lives will be different for the better."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825.02,"image":{"id":1759368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy more animals and increase the size of her fledgling animal husbandry microenterprise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Surendranagar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T21:30:27Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T21:30:27Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonalben Lakhmanbhai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sajuben Balabhai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jashuben Rameshbhai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rupaben Jilabhai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anuben Sanjaybhai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":69000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5821.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624464649},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636638941},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649620346},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100405},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398486},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608652},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532406},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046950},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5821,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135695}],"funded_date":"2015-01-16T19:15:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":816215,"name":"Sou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 32-year-old mother of five, Sou operates a small business selling pancakes, buns and pork cakes in her community to earn a living.

So she has experience and knowledge in managing this type of business. <br \/><br \/>But tired of working in other people's workshops and wanting to spend more time with her children she decided to start her own sewing workshop. So she wants to buy a lock-stitch sew machine, an cover-stitch sewing machine, a flat table machine and sewing supplies like needles and thread. <br \/><br \/>This will allow her to start her production which she hopes will generate a good impact in the market to provide suitable profits and thus fulfill her dream of positioning herself in the market. With her drive and ambition she looks at a middle future generating employment always with the help of the Interactuar Corporation."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":456.7,"image":{"id":1756575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy a lock-stitch sew machine, an cover-stitch sewing machine, a flat table machine and sewing supplies like needles and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Marinilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2014-12-21T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T21:40:04Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.43,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.75,"local_amount":173738,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":174897.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611815682},{"amount":39.74,"local_amount":95766,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-19T10:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":96405.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.36,"payment_id":624865264},{"amount":39.76,"local_amount":94953,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-18T11:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":95586.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636622675},{"amount":39.42,"local_amount":94146,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":94774.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649596731},{"amount":41.9,"local_amount":100057,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T12:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100724.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665455954},{"amount":41.05,"local_amount":99544,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100208.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.63,"payment_id":681373930},{"amount":39.02,"local_amount":105800,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-21T12:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":106506.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.28,"payment_id":697631948},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":102725,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":103410.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.42,"payment_id":711501449},{"amount":42.87,"local_amount":112395,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":113145.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.2,"payment_id":731019147},{"amount":40.16,"local_amount":111517,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":112261.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.54,"payment_id":752107392}],"funded_date":"2014-12-31T04:12:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":819523,"name":"Sera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sera is 18 years old and runs a small business selling elei printing in her community.

A pesar de que Domingo es una persona mayor de edad, a \u00e9l no le gusta perder su tiempo. \n\nDomingo para seguir elaborando mas cortes,  necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para  tener un capital de trabajo para la compra de materia prima tales como (Hilos y jaspes de todos los colores), Con estas dos actividades domingo a logrado  progresar con su familia, el anhelo de \u00e9l ahora es contar con un local donde pueda exhibir sus cortes.  \n","en":"Domingo is 68 years old and has a wonderful family consisting of four adult children. He lives in the community of Solal\u00e1 and has a lot of work experience. For the most part he has worked for many years at the painstaking job of making lengths of traditional cloth for which he uses a loom operated by foot. \r\n\r\nThe lengths of cloth that he weaves are one of the items of traditional clothing worn by the women of the area where he lives.\r\n\r\nIn his spare time Domingo is also involved in farming to earn extra income. In spite of being of advanced years he does not like to waste his time.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue his weaving, he needs a loan to buy basic supplies such as thread and birthstones of all colours. With his two jobs Domingo has managed to help his family get ahead. His challenge now is to find premises where he can display his weavings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1785546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Green"],"use":"buy

contributing to 40% of her total family income. She runs a small garage, repairing motor vehicles. For a woman from a small town in Gujarat, educated only till the 4th grade due to poor economic conditions, this is quite an achievement. Adept with finances, she saves Rs. 3000 after providing for her family of three, including her teen-aged child. \n\nThere is scope for her to earn more, though. Her town is situated on the heavily used arterial road that connects the important cities of Ahmedabad and Vadodara from Gujarat to Indore in Madhya Pradesh. There is always a demand for good mechanics, and Khursida wants to capitalize on this. She wants to rent out some workshop space for her garage, so she is more accessible to potential customers. She also needs to buy new tools like spanners, wrenches, a workbench, and a lathe. Khursida, however, cannot spare the finances to put down a deposit for the workshop rental space and to buy her costly hardware. \n\nSo to raise this capital, Khursida has formed a joint liability group with Abedabibi, who also runs a garage service, and Sakesa, Mksudabibi, and Salmaben, who run poultry microenterprises. As a group, they hope to access the microfinance necessary to grow their small businesses through crowdfunding. They seek a loan of Rs. 64,000. \n\nKhursidabibi has high hopes for her child, wanting to provide the best education she can afford. She believes providing a public college education will give her child access to a range of opportunities that can improve their lives. Your loan will help Khursida guarantee a complete education for her child and develop sustainable finances to support her family as she ages. She is glad to have this opportunity to uplift her family through honest and diligent

Agriculture has been a family tradition for her and her husband, a job that has been passed down through generations. But the income that she currently makes is barely sufficient to meet the household expenses. She is left with a meager savings of Rs. 4000, insufficient to provide for the future of her five children. Therefore, she intends to use her share of the enterprise loan to buy more fertilizers and seeds, so that she can grow varied kinds of crops in her field. There is a high demand for corn, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and ginger. So she will grow these crops and sell the produce. The better quality seeds and fertilizers she will purchase with the loan will guarantee a high yield, one that will help her in increasing the income and bringing financial stability.\n\nThe other group members are in a similar socio-economic situation. Kamliben and Shardaben will use their share of the loan to develop their respective microenterprises of agriculture and bamboo products. \n\nYour loan will not just help Navlibe and her group to expand their small businesses.

She will also have Rs. 4000 each month to reinvest in the growth of her business. Over a period of time, she will be able to guarantee that her five children get a complete education.

She now hopes to expand her microenterprise by increasing the items she sells so that she can increase her income.\n\nShe plans to buy additional items like Vaseline, ghee, butter, sugar, and oil in larger quantities. This will help her increase her customer base and provide more goods to increase her income. But, local banks will not provide the microfinance Chuniben needs to expand her small business. So Chuniben has joined with four other local women who run similar small businesses and want to expand their microenterprises. Her group comprises of Sushilaben and Sunitaben, who run their petty shops, and Manjuben and Ramilaben, who run their dress material shops. Chuniben and her group seek to crowdfund the Rs. 50,000 they need to expand their small businesses. \n\nYour loan will help these women to expand their businesses, increase their incomes, and provide a better quality of life for their children. In Chuniben\u2019s case, this investment will help her business net an additional Rs. 6000 each month. She will take Rs. 2000 home to add to her savings, and will use the rest to continue growing her small business. Having never been to school, educating her own three children is her most important goal. She is grateful for this opportunity to achieve it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600.02,"image":{"id":1758541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Since she typically sews sari falls and interlocks, she wants to buy and stock these materials in bulk, so she can take on more orders. A skilled seamstress, she also wants to stock up on dress materials and make and sell ready garments. These measures can help her increase her income by Rs. 5000 a month, adding to her savings and leaving enough to reinvest in her small business.\n\nAll these purchases need capital.

Ahmedabad, Gujarat, runs a provisional store. She didn't get the opportunity to attend middle school, and somehow completed her primary level education. But she had the potential and the business acumen to start up a provisional store. Further, this initiative was more of a necessity. Her husband's income is barely sufficient to meet their household expenses, which tends to be a sum of Rs. 5000. She tries to supplement to his income by working very hard to earn this amount. The remaining Rs. 3000 that her husband earns, she sets aside entirely as savings for her children\u2019s education. \n\nNow, to guarantee that all four of her children can access public college, she wants to expand her microbusiness further. She intends to buy a lot of stock in bulk so that she can cater to more customers. Items like biscuits, chocolates, snacks, and chips sell fast in her residential area that is also close to developing business localities. By purchasing them in bulk, her shop stands to improve profit margins and revenue, netting an extra Rs. 10,500 each month. With the amount, Anitaben can almost double her savings and reinvest in the growth of her microenterprise. \n\nLocal banks do not provide financial assistance to micro-entrepreneurs like Anitaben. So she has formed a Joint Liability Group along with three other industrious women, who aspire to live a better life and to educate their children. With the loan, Sunitaben, Shardaben, and Chandrakalaben will also expand their respective business of selling handbags, saris, and making and selling handicrafts. \n\nYour loan will help ensure financial stability for Anitaben and her group members. This will help them fulfill their dreams of sending their children to college. Further, it will build up their confidence and self-esteem tremendously. Anitaben conveys the gratitude of the entire group for your support in their endeavors to build a better

in Dahod, a small town in eastern Gujarat near the state\u2019s borders with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. \n\nTo cope with the additional expenditure of her children\u2019s education, Ajijabibi has been running a petty shop, a small departmental store, out of her house. She purchases her stock from the wholesale market and sells it for a small profit in her shop.  She earns Rs. 2000 a month, and saves the entire sum along with an extra Rs. 2500 from the income her husband brings in. Their savings and the income from her small business are critical in keeping her family financially afloat. \n\nHowever, Ajijajbibi needs to explore options to grow her income and savings. This is crucial if she must stabilize her family\u2019s finances while also fulfilling her hopes of putting all her four children through public college. Business at her shop has been good enough, and there certainly is an extra demand that she currently cannot fulfill due to limited stock. If she had more stock, she could meet more of her customers\u2019 demand. The main challenge she faces is the lack of funds to invest in and scale up her small business. The bulk purchase of stock requires hefty investments, which she is unable to afford. On the plus side, buying in bulk will let her negotiate a better purchase rate. She will also save transportation costs she would have otherwise incurred by making multiple trips. Overall, she can net an extra Rs. 5000 per month in increased income and profits.\n\nSeeing the huge immediate and long-term benefits, Ajijabibi formed a group with four other local women in similar circumstances, all of them seeking to grow their own microenterprises. Hamidabibi, Sultanabibi, and Najmabibi sell toys, and Rahisabibi runs a poultry business. They are seeking a group loan amount of Rs. 75,000. \n\nYour loan will help Ajijabibi make an investment that will more than double her contribution to her family\u2019s income. The increased income will also leave her with an extra Rs. 2500 each month to reinvest in the growth and development of her small petty shop. She is grateful for this opportunity to improve her life and that of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1757601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This move can increase her enterprise income by Rs. 10,000, more than double her current income. Of this, she plans to reinvest 80% every month towards growing her business further. \n\nTo achieve these goals, young Raziya formed the Piran Pir Mahila Mandal group with three other local women microentrepreneurs. Together, they seek to crowdfund Rs. 60,000 in microfinance. Raziya will use the funds to buy more stock, as planned, for her vegetable selling microenterprise, and the other three members, Virbai, Jenatbai, and Memunabai, will similarly invest in growing their respective microenterprises of tailoring, selling clothes, and running a petty shop. Your loan will help Raziya and her group of hardworking and diligent women to progress towards their goals of financial independence and stability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":712.52,"image":{"id":1757915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To buy vegetables like tomatoes, okra, potatoes, eggplant, and chilies in bulk to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Adipur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T21:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T21:50:19Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raziya Alimamadbhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virbai Abharambhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenatbai Kasambhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memunabai Alibhai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624464662},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-19T11:21:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636638954},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649620359},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100418},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398499},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608665},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532419},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046963},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135708}],"funded_date":"2015-01-06T11:08:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":818515,"name":"Sakhi Mahila Mandal Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Purbai, the group leader (first from right in the picture), lives in Gandhidham, in the Kutch district of Gujarat.

Her microenterprise brings home an income of 4,000 Indian rupees (INR) a month, contributing to 25% of her family\u2019s income. She uses this income to cover expenses for her family of five, including education costs for her two teenaged children. \n\nPurbai\u2019s lack of education is her driving force in ensuring that her children have access to what she could not. Her family manages to save 2,000 INR a month, but this is not sufficient to ensure that her two children get a better life than her own. \n\nPurbai now seeks a loan to grow her small cloth and garments business by buying extra stock. Bulk buying will allow her to negotiate better purchase rates with her suppliers and make a profit. Having more stock, she will also be able to cater to the additional demand she sees each month. This will especially help boost her income during the festive and auspicious wedding season in India. She stands to net an additional 10,000 INR a month, which makes a huge difference to Purbai. She will be able to more than double her income with the potential to save 8,000 INR a month. It will also leave a substantial sum each month to reinvest in her business, making her business a sustainably growing income source. \n\nPurbai comes together with a group of women like herself to seek a loan of 40,000 INR towards growing their microenterprises. Sonidevi, like Purbai, has her own cloth business; Muniben runs a petty shop; and Sita tailors clothes.

microenterprise in the small town of Adipur in the Kutch district of Gujarat in western India. She is a part of the local construction industry and mostly makes centering structures, which she can then rent out to building masons. These structures are used when building arches, vaults, etc., during construction. Sherbanu makes these by fixing a few plane wooden blocks supported by bamboo poles. The rent is decided based upon the square feet area of the structure. One structure can be used three or four times to build the roof in construction. After this, the old structure cannot be used anymore. So, after renting a structure out three to four times, Sherbanu cannot make any more money off it and has to build a new structure. If Sherbanu could increase the number of structures she makes and rents out at a time, she could almost double the money her small business brings in. \n\nSherbanu\u2019s family could certainly use the extra income and savings as she has two teenagers and one primary school-aged child to raise and educate. With a family of six, their current savings of 5,000 Indian rupees (INR) a month will not be able to provide for the children\u2019s education. To put this plan to earn more into action, Sherbanu needs capital to buy bamboos, ropes, wooden blocks, and some accessories to build more centering structures. She will also buy other materials to support her construction business. \n\nSo, Sherbanu formed the Bukhari Mahila Mandal Group with three other confident and diligent local women microentrepreneurs. This is a joint liability group through which they hope to access financial assistance and develop their respective microenterprises: Aaisa runs a petty shop, Roshan runs an embroidery business, and Sakina operates an auto repair service. Collectively, they seek to crowdfund microfinance of 60,000 INR as a loan.\n\nSherbanu, like her group members, could not attend school due to difficult circumstances back then but dreams of providing education and a better future for her children. Your loan will help change their lives to a huge extent. With your support, Sherbanu will be able to increase her monthly income by 50% and double her family\u2019s savings. Not only will your loan help to improve the family\u2019s standard of living and guarantee education for her children, but it will also build Sherbanu\u2019s self-confidence as she reinvests part of her increased profits towards further growth. \n\nSherbanu is grateful for this opportunity to improve her life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":712.52,"image":{"id":1757906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":["Underfunded

important transport hub in eastern Gujarat near the state\u2019s borders with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. She runs a petty shop, selling small quantities of groceries and products for daily use, such as vaseline, sugar, oil, ghee, incense, and rice, to customers in her neighborhood. The Rs. 5,000 she earns contributes to a third of her family\u2019s income, and she saves this entire amount. Her shop sees a steady stream of business, though stocks are often low and there is little variety. This means she has to, sometimes, turn away customers and the opportunity to earn more. \n\nChelaben and her family could certainly use the extra money to build a financially stable future and improve their living conditions. If she invests in additional quantities of stock, Chelaben\u2019s shop can net an increased profit of Rs. 8,000 each month. Diligent with her finances despite receiving only a primary education, she plans to reinvest some of this to make her business self-sustaining, and will use the rest to grow her own savings by almost 40%. Seeking to finance these plans, she has formed a group with four other local women micro entrepreneurs, Anitaben, Gitaben, and Senaben, who also run their own petty shops, and Sumiben, who sells vegetables. All of them are married with children, and want to grow their businesses to earn more and fund their children\u2019s education. \n\nThe main challenge all of them face is the lack of funds to invest in and scale up their businesses. Despite the businesses running successfully, they are unable to purchase stocks in higher quantities since this requires additional investment which they do not possess. Prayas (Milaap\u2019s partner) works with women-entrepreneurs like Chelaben and her group to help them realize the full potential of their businesses by helping them crowdfund loans to scale-up operations. A loan of Rs. 75,000 will help them purchase the stock necessary to grow their microenterprises. Your loan will help them realize their goals of financial independence, stability, and education for their children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1758460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

By purchasing them in bulk, she can negotiate better rates from her suppliers and save on making multiple trips to the market for buying these items. She will also be able to serve more customers, as currently, she has to turn them away when she runs out of stock. Overall, she stands to earn an extra Rs. 8,000, of which she will save Rs. 3,000 and invest the rest in further developing her tea stall.\n\nBelonging to a socio-economically backward family, Rupaben she is not able to avail any loan from the local banks to carry out her business plans.

In addition to this goal, Kamuben also needs to start building up savings for her and her husband\u2019s retirement. Given that she contributes up to 60% of their collective earnings and has the potential to increase this contribution, she has taken on the onus for this. She wants to grow her business into a self-sustaining source of income that will help them weather the increases in costs of living and medical expenses as the years pass. She does not want to be a burden on her child in her old age. \n\nMotivated by these goals, she plans to increase her stock of sarees, buying them in bulk and greater variety. She will negotiate better rates from her suppliers, save on trips to the market, and cater to more demand from her customers. She stands to net an additional Rs. 10,000 each month as an immediate consequence of making these investments. During the ongoing festive and auspicious wedding season, this amount could go up. It will triple her current savings, and still leave enough to reinvest in sustaining the business. Lack of access to capital, however, stops Kamuben from putting her plan into action. \n\nIn the last few years, Milaap and its field partner, Prayas, have been advancing the cause of underserved families like Kamuben. Prayas helped her identify four other local women who could benefit from access to microcredit. A loan of Rs. 100,000 will help Kamuben, Hanshaben, and Jasuben to expand their saree business, Sonalben to invest in her glass show piece business, and Sitaben to diversify her fruit-selling enterprise."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1312.5,"image":{"id":1758216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

two young children in Chandkheda, a neighborhood in the thriving city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, in western India. The leader of this group, she sells ready-made garments as part of her clothes business. She makes trips to the larger wholesale markets to procure these garments at lower rates, and sells them to local customers at a profit. \n\nSince she lives in a residential area that is also near a developing business zone, there is enough demand to justify expanding her business. In particular, her customers seek urban wear like t-shirts, jeans, leggings, tops, and even kurtis or Indian tunics. By growing her inventory of these garments in size and variety, Somiben stands to enjoy a monthly increase of Rs. 8000 in her revenue and profits. Of this, she will take Rs. 2000 home as income and invest the rest back into the further development of her business. \n\nSomiben has a long term goal of converting her small scale business into a sustainable source of income. She wants to ensure that she and her husband are financially independent in their old age. Her greatest wish, however, is to provide both her children a full college education. She had to drop out after primary school due to economic constraints, so this wish is the strongest motivating factor for her. \n\nCurrently, Somiben earns Rs. 6000 a month, almost matching what her husband brings in. She saves her husband\u2019s entire income towards her children\u2019s future and to cushion them during any emergencies. Their savings do not leave room to finance her business expansion plans. So she and four other women in her group, Shantaben and Nanduben, who have their clothing business, Bhavnaben, who sells vegetables, and Madhuben, who owns a toran business, seek to crowdfund the capital for their business expansion plans. They seek a loan of Rs. 65,000.\n\nYour loan will not only help boost their business, but will also empower them to uplift their socio-economic condition, providing a secure future for their children. Somiben is particularly grateful for your support in making her goals and wishes a

the Kutch district of Gujarat, in western India. To supplement her family income, Maniben has been running a masonry microenterprise, a part of the local construction industry, where she mostly makes centering structures \u2013 temporary structures that builders use as a frame to build arches and vaults of a housing structure. Hardworking Maniben builds these centering structures using wood blocks, bamboo, ropes, etc., and rents them out to local builders. Through her efforts and diligence, she has grown her small business over the years, keeping her family financially afloat and her children in school. \n\nAt the late age of 46, Maniben shoulders the responsibility of a large family. She has seven children: two in primary school, and 5 teenagers. With so many children to feed and educate, she cannot expect her expenses to dwindle. Like women in many parts of rural India, she had little say in the number of children she would have; many factors govern this private decision. Maniben wants things to be different for her sons and daughters. She believes education will bring them the right to make choices and access opportunities for progress, and she wants to guarantee that her children receive a good education. The costs of ensuring this are high, and will soon be beyond the reach of her current savings of Rs. 4500 a month. \n\nSo, she has decided to further grow her small scale business of renting and selling centering structures. For this, Maniben needs to purchase raw materials such as bamboos, ropes, wood blocks, etc. to build more centering structures. The ability to build and rent multiple centering structures at a time will let her cater to more customers. She will be able to almost double her monthly savings, and invest an equal amount in the further growth of her business. \n\nSeeking to fund these plans, she has formed a group with other local women entrepreneurs who fight the same adversary of socio-economic backwardness: Bauben, Puniben, Laxmiben, and Paruben also want to expand their own centering structure businesses. They collectively request a loan of Rs. 75,000.

She wants a different future for her child, with hopes of ensuring a public college education. As she and her husband age, they also need to build a corpus and sustainable livelihood that will leave them self-sufficient and cared for. With these goals to fulfill, Gitaben has set out to grow her tiffin service micro enterprise. Given the factories, railway traffic, and archaeological sites in Dhrangadhra, there is no shortage of potential new customers. \n\nWith adequate and timely capital to invest in her tiffin business, Gitaben can pay deposits and opt for serving large orders. She can invest in bulk produce and ingredients, catering to more individual customers and negotiating better rates with suppliers. There is potential to immediately start earning an extra Rs. 3,000 each month from her enterprise, which she can either take home as savings or reinvest in further growth. To access the capital she needs to carry out her plans, Gitaben has formed a group with two more local entrepreneurs who share the same goals. One of them runs a petty shop and the other a tiffin service. Together, they seek a loan of Rs. 60,000 to expand their respective micro enterprises. \n\nThe loan will help Gitaben and the women in her group take the measures necessary to increase their incomes and provide better for their families and children. They will be able to grow their small businesses into self-sustaining income generators for their later years.

Rukshana and her group seek to crowdfund Rs. 65,000 as an enterprise development loan. \n\nThe loan will help these women to expand their businesses, increase their income and provide a better quality of life for their children. This will provide them and their family with financial security and stability. Rukshana, in particular, is grateful and determined to make the best of this opportunity to provide her child with the education she believes will present a chance to uplift themselves out of poverty."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":854.18,"image":{"id":1758029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

years old. They live in a small village that is very poor and has a strong tradition of agricultural work as the main source of their economy. As with others, she keeps sheep, goats and lambs, currently having almost 30 animals that she cares for and tends to. She and her husband are able to sell the milk and the milk products in the market. Sometimes she even sells the sheep for more income once they are ready. She also has a greenhouse, where she plants different vegetables primarily for her family\u2019s consumption and to cut expenses but to sell if necessary as well. She is a very hardworking woman, doing everything she can to offer and provide her children with anything that they need. \n\nShefkije is very satisfied with this work being the main source of her family\u2019s income. She has been in business for more than 12 years now. For the first time, she is requesting a loan in order to renovate her stable and purchase more lambs to further expand her farm. Her goal is to be able to continue with this type of business and generate more income and profit. She is very grateful for the support and thanks all of the Kiva lenders.
