Kutch district in the state of Gujarat, in western India. She has been running her business of agriculture for years now. She grows and sells produce like grains and vegetables at the local market. Her efforts bring in Rs. 3,500 a month, contributing to almost 30 percent of her family\u2019s monthly income. She sets aside this entire amount to put toward the education and future of her three children: two teenagers and a preschooler. She wants to save more, because this amount cannot guarantee that her three children will be able to access a complete education. \r\n\r\nShe plans to increase her agricultural yield by investing in better fertilizers and quality seeds. She will grow wheat, millet, vegetables, and lemons. The returns would be huge, almost tripling her monthly income, leaving enough for her to fund her small-scale business. But a lack of access to funds stands in the way of her implementing these plans. \r\n\r\nUnwilling to let this dampen her spirits, she formed the Chamunda Mahila Mandal, a joint liability group, with three other fiercely independent women who, like many other local mothers, sustain their families by running their own successful microenterprises. Nishaben seeks to grow her animal husbandry microenterprise, and Champaben and Keshareben want to expand their vegetable selling businesses. Forming a group gives these women a chance to crowdfund the microfinance they need to grow the earning potential of their small-scale businesses. They collectively are seeking a microfinance loan of Rs. 50,000.\r\n\r\nPaluben could not go to school. But she understands the importance of education and the role it plays in empowering people to uplift themselves out of poverty. So she is ready to work hard and provide the best of education to her children. Your loan will contribute toward her achieving this goal."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600.02,"image":{"id":1757901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers to grow her agricultural business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhachau","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-01-05T22:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T22:50:20Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paluben ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nishaben ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Champaben ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kesharben","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624464675},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-20T11:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636638967},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T14:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649620372},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-17T14:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665100431},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T15:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681398512},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T15:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":696608678},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T16:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711532432},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731046976},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135721}],"funded_date":"2015-01-06T15:24:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":815086,"name":"Maria Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Maria tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, muy humilde, luchadora, din\u00e1mica la cual a pesar de su edad ella piensa siempre en el presente para superarse no dejando las cosas para el ma\u00f1ana.

This is why she is asking for a loan to buy agricultural supplies that will help her to grow coffee and basic grains. She will also use the funds to buy certified corn seeds that she can plant.

This will have a two-fold effect on her business: attracting more customers, and improving profit margins by letting her negotiate better rates with her suppliers. She forecasts a growth of Rs. 13,000 in her enterprise income, of which she will add Rs. 5,000 to double her personal savings, and will use the rest to further grow her microenterprise. <br \/><br \/>Shantaben needs capital, though, to carry out these plans for expansion. Since banks do not provide microfinance to borrowers like her, she formed a joint liability group, the Mahesh P Mahila Mandal 006, with four other industrious local women, to seek a loan of Rs. 100,000. With this loan, Shantaben will be able to realize her goals of earning more through her clothes-selling business. The other women, Rajuben, Nanbai, Ranbai, and Sarasvati, will use their share of the loan to similarly develop their respective snack selling, cloth selling, and furniture manufacturing small businesses. <br \/><br \/>Having married young, and hailing from a poor family, Shantaben did not have an opportunity to go to school. She understands very well how that can limit one\u2019s ability to progress in life. So, educating her child is a goal very close to her heart. Your loan will help her execute the crucial plans she has to ensure this goal."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1757955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

the heart of the copperbelt province of Zambia lies Mufulira district. A small town located 16 km from the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is where Theresa owns her mobile money transfer business. She is 26 years old and comes from a family of six. \r\n\r\nShe has a diploma in Production & Operations Management. Once her business starts to make more profit, she plans to pursue a degree in her course, because she believes that a good education is important in life. Theresa has been running her business for 3 months now. She loves her business because it is able to provide money to customers who urgently need the money and it puts a smile on their faces. When asked what challenges she faces in her business, Theresa says that transportation of cash to and from the bank is very difficult because her location is not very secure. She says once she gets the Kiva loan, she will not have to move cash with her because she will have a good enough working capital and it will be much easier to go about her day-to-day business. \r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan will help Theresa to hire one person to help in her shop. She says it will also help her to add to her working capital so that she does not have to constantly carry cash to and from the bank. Theresa asks Kiva lenders to help her increase her working capital, serve more customers, and earn more profits. She plans to save her profits so that she can open a second Zoona mobile money transfer shop soon.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1757840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to employ one person and add on the funds that she uses to serve her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Mufulira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2014-12-21T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Theresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":11400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":11400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-27T03:13:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Narindra-Dastoor","image":153719}},{"id":814374,"name":"Maria Auxiliadora Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Maria Auxiliadora est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 3\u00b0 Del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante.

She says the loan was very helpful in growing her business as she is now able to serve more customers who come to send and receive money and she no longer has to turn them away. She then got a second loan to help open a new outlet by purchasing a Zoona branded trading booth. Her earnings have improved and she is excited about the growth of her business. She has even employed two more people to help her run the two outlets.<br \/><br \/>Tamara is taking out a subsequent loan for her new shop in Kafue. The loan will be used as working capital float for her new outlet. Right now, the new Kafue shop is working on a minimal working capital float of $1,000.

Here, hundreds turn up to get trained in the hope that they will replicate her model on their own farmland. However the biggest challenge she faces is satisfying the demand for milk in her village. The demand is overwhelming. She is seeking a loan to buy another dairy cow. She believes that through the loan, she will be able to improve her living conditions and be able to secure the future of her children. Having gone through training with Juhudi Kilimo, she is confident that the skills she acquired will help her increase her business and she will be able to pay back the loan. Ruth is confident that if you invest in her dream you will be impacting the life of her family and children.<br \/><br \/>Please consider lending to Ruth."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":571.25,"image":{"id":1759301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyenya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-21T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-04T23:50:04Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.48,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4416.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4678.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4814.85},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4955.56},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5100.39},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5249.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5402.86},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5560.76},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5723.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5890.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6062.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.95,"local_amount":4720.3,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4788.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824652},{"amount":52.98,"local_amount":4722.88,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4790.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262681},{"amount":52.64,"local_amount":4692.34,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4759.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264859},{"amount":52.07,"local_amount":4641.4,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4708.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601033},{"amount":56.65,"local_amount":5050.1,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5122.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459499},{"amount":57.39,"local_amount":5225.44,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5300.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.23,"payment_id":681377911},{"amount":55.66,"local_amount":5102.99,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.59,"payment_id":696587586},{"amount":57.92,"local_amount":5469.58,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5548.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.44,"payment_id":711505889},{"amount":60.97,"local_amount":5640.96,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5721.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.31,"payment_id":731022711},{"amount":61.54,"local_amount":5655.8,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5737.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.91,"payment_id":752110907}],"funded_date":"2014-12-22T05:10:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":816259,"name":"Tina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tina is an ambitious 27-year-old woman.

He lives in a rented house with his wife Yvonne and their two young children, Luwi, 5, and Holenu, 2.  Sunday works very hard to support his family. He works full time as a driver and equipment loader for one of the mining companies in Luanshya, Zambia. He recently started running a Zoona mobile money transfer business so that he would be able to provide for his family as his salary was not enough to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nSunday describes his business as a safe way for people in his community to move their monies from one place to the other, without having to go to the banks, which most of his customers find intimidating. He likes running the business because it is a decent way to earn a living and he is able to work full time while running it. Sunday has employed one person to work as a teller at his shop. \r\n\r\nSunday has requested his first loan so that he can purchase the trading booth that he is currently using. The trading booth costs ZMK 6,400. He will use the other ZMK 5,000 to serve customers by adding to his float. Right now, Sunday operates with a minimum working capital of ZMK 1,000, as he did not have a lot of money to invest in the business. This money is barely enough to serve customers. His teller constantly has to make trips to the bank to convert the electronic into cash and vise versa. This makes Sunday lose a lot of business as he is forced to leave the booth unattended while they look for cash.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help Sunday to have money to serve his customers more efficiently.

As a single mother, she struggles day to day to get her business and her young son ahead. With a lot of effort, she is finishing her university studies in the weekend program, to be able to work Monday through Friday and provide her son with what he needs. \r\n\r\nThanks to her desires to get ahead, she works selling cosmetics by catalog such as perfumes, blush, eye shadow, eyeliner, eye pencils, eye creams, highlighting concealer, lip pencils, lip gloss, anti-wrinkle creams, moisturizers, etc. This young mother's work routine is some ten hours each day offering her products to regular and occasional customers so that in the not-too-distant future she can get more income.

She is originally from Managua and is hardworking, responsible and driven to improve her personal situation. She started working from a very young age to earn her daily bread as her family had a low income. She currently works hard to maintain her business and her independent life. \r\n\r\nShe started off selling vegetables and as she liked the business she decided to start selling products such as clothing, shoes, and perfumes and had good results. She runs this business to the present day due to her motivation to better herself.\r\n\r\nAs a result of her perseverance and her love for her work her business activities include selling clothing, perfumes and shoes. She has been putting her efforts into the business for twenty three years and it is located in one of the markets in her local area. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the loan is to invest in working capital and take advantage of the season when children and young people are going back to school. Therefore, she needs stock such as shirts, pants, skirts, blouses, backpacks, socks, camisoles, belts, black school shoes, etc so that in the not too distant future she can improve her income. Ofelia acknowledges the support that Kiva lenders offer to people with scarce resources in poor countries such as Nicaragua. This enables these individuals to have work that is dignified. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1307143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to invest in merchandise such as shorts, pants, skirts, blouses, backpacks, socks, camisoles, belts, black school shoes, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2015-01-06T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ofelia Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jemma Ives","image":1373786}},{"id":816273,"name":"Pov's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pov\u2019s group lives in a rural village in Prey Veng province in Cambodia.

The profits from the business will be used to renovate his house.\n\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Since he was in university, this man, who is currently 36 years old, has helped his mother with her stall, where they sell fruits and vegetables in their house. When he graduated with a degree in business administration, he got a part-time job in city hall, which he used to help his mother to sustain their home, while still helping her with her business, until the day she gave it to him when she went to Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nNow, Julio has been the owner of this store for four years, which little by little has been thriving. He started selling baho (a meat and yucca dish), with chairs and tables, to satisfy his customers. \r\n\r\nAlthough it's certain that he counts on the support of two of his sisters, he wants to continue to invest, which is why he asks for a loan to buy pineapples, bananas, lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, and other products that his clients ask for. This will allow him to expand his business capital and to pursue his goals.

For the past many days, his rickshaw is not working properly because of regular use. He feels that most of its parts are out of order. So he is unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to buy a new auto rickshaw. However, due to lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Sumaira has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him continue with his business.

Meet Martha, a very hardworking mother who is 52 years of age. She is a small holder farmer from Sigowet, a remote village in the fertile Kericho area of Kenya. This charming mother has been engaged in mixed farming for the past 10 years. She commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers in her village. Her main source of income has been eggs, milk, tea, and a variety of food crops that she plants. Taking care of her poultry is an activity she finds very enjoyable. Feeding her poultry is her hobby. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kericho. Martha has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market. However, the demand is so high. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she has always wanted to increase her poultry business. She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Martha will achieve their dreams and goals. Martha believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding of poultry and taking good care of them. By ensuring that the poultry are fed well, she is guaranteed to reap the benefits. In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan. Martha needs your support urgently as she only has this business with which to generate major income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":556.96,"image":{"id":1759361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase poultry for her farming business.

Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 30 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad de manera independiente. \nEs por esos motivos que Dionicia solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ganado cam\u00e9lido para su engorde debido a la temporada de lluvias.\n","en":"Dionicia is a forty-seven-year-old woman. She is married and has five children who are 18, 16, 14, 12, and 3 years old. Her business is the sale of camelidae (llamas). <br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, entrepreneurial, joyful, optimistic, happy, and has a good attitude. She is responsible and is a hard worker. She carries out her business in the community of Hichocota located near the sacred Lake Titicaca. It has a cold, dry climate with a temperature that varies between 2 and 12 degrees centigrade and the rays of the sun are extremely strong there.<br \/><br \/>Dionicia is dark skinned with long, black, braided hair. Her clothing is traditional (hat, shawl, and pollera [Andean skirt]). Her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks in her area. She also speaks Spanish as a result of the general society and to conduct business in the city. She spends her life with her husband, who makes a living in agriculture, and her children who study at the school and help with the businesses. They live in their own home made of adobe with a straw roof. The house has electricity and well water. <br \/><br \/>Her business is the sale of camelidae livestock like llamas and alpacas. She buys the livestock to fatten them up and once they have grown in size, weight, and their fur has grown, she sells them at different livestock markets in the are and neighboring communities. \"The llamas, vicunas, and alpacas are used for the fur, their meat, and for their guarding instincts that is reflected in their care for flocks...\" she says. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to improve her stable to have more space to raise cattle. She wants to invest in the business through the purchase of llamas to fatten them up since the rainy season is coming and with it the growth of the scrubland and feed for the livestock. This is her first loan with the institution after 30 years carrying out this business independently.<br \/><br \/>It is for these reasons that Dionicia is requesting a loan to buy camelidae livestock to fatten them up since it is the rainy season."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":677,"image":{"id":1757588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

For the past many days his rickshaw has not been working properly so he has been unable to generate any amount of income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However, due to the lack of money he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Mukhtar has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business.

She would not have otherwise been able to buy the supplies she needed. Thanks to the communal bank's confidence in her, she was able to buy manure, foliar fertiliser, and normal fertiliser.

He is originally from Manuaga.  He is a responsible, hard-working person, with desire to improve himself. Unfortunately he couldn't go to school due to lack of economic resources, and he worked to learn the trade of tailoring and sewing things. Currently it has given very good results and it is his way of life and that for his family.\r\n\r\nThanks to his desire to get ahead, he has a tailoring shop as his work, located in his house; he has had this business for fifteen years and it includes making articles such as pillows, towels, sheets, bedspreads, and he works primarily to order. This man's work routine is some ten hours each day, offering his services in his tailoring shop. The purpose of the loan is to invest in working capital and stock his business with the purchase of raw material such as fabric, thread, lace, buttons, fasteners, zippers, and ribbon, so that in the not-so-distant future he can get more income and make some of his dreams come true such as making repairs to his house and giving more stability to his family. Pedro is grateful for the help that the Kiva investors offer to people of limited economic resources and in poor countries such as Nicaragua to have a dignified means of work.
