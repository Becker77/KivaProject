S. is a 33 year old man living in a rural community of Costa Rica called San Crist\u00f3bal Norte, 45 kilometers south of San Jos\u00e9.  San Crist\u00f3bal is a hilly area where people work in areas such as trade, agriculture (vegetables, coffee, and other crops), handicrafts, livestock farming, and many other areas. Eddy lives with his wife Xinia, who is the homemaker, and with their two daughters Maricruz and Yirlany. \r\n\r\nEddy works mainly in agriculture specializing in vegetables.  He says he has been doing this almost all his life.  He has a farm where he has planted different vegetables and tubers.  At the moment, the products he has at his farm are tomatoes and potatoes. \r\n\r\nRight now, he wants to request a loan for \u00a2650,000 (six hundred fifty thousand col\u00f3nes) to buy different foods and fertilizers, and to hire a farmhand, since it is very difficult to get everything done himself.  With this he hopes that the harvest will be big and of good quality; he also wishes that his business will grow and help him to succeed in generating income to improve his standard of living. \r\n\r\nEddy belongs to Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal San Crist\u00f3bal Norte (SACRIN), one of the 100 organizations partnered with EDESA in Costa Rica.  He has received 5 small loans and has repayed them responsibly.  He says that, thanks to these loans, he has been able to better develop himself and grow as a person.  He also feels very happy that he has been able to provide his young daughters with the opportunity to study.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hannah Lily, Kiva

He lives in a polygamous family in the Kabo\u00efla I- K\u00e9l\u00e9tiguila district, the downtown of the city of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After having run several businesses unsuccessfully, he decided to settle on commerce in clothing six years ago. \r\n\r\nGiven the increase in customers and the fact his own resources are not able to meet their expectations, he thought it useful to come to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso to request this first individual loan, so as to augment his own funds.  \r\n\r\nHe intends to use his first loan to purchase 5 pairs of \u201cFerardine\u201d shoes, 3 \u201cAbacos\u201d suits with jackets, 4 pairs of basic shoes, a dozen belts, 6 pants of different grades, 8 different shirts, etc.   He supplies himself in Bamako (from wholesalers), and he makes his sales essentially door-to-door among various professional organizations both governmental and private, in Sikasso City.  \r\n\r\nThe current loan will enable him to realize a profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used to augment his working capital, to honor his commitments with regard to Soro Yiriwaso, and to cover additional family expenses.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

In addition, the bookstore also offers photocopying services, which gives her an edge over her competitors.  She rises very early every day to tend to her shop because she knows that, the more hours she's open, the higher her earnings will be.

She has been in this line of work for 3 years and she considers the most difficult part of it to be having to stay open until very late at night.  In time, she would like to improve her shop's infrastructure so that she can offer better customer service.

This bank is in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador\u2019s third most important.  Cuenca is located in the south-central part of the country and its climate is cold, which permits its inhabitants to farm various fruits and vegetables both for the local market and for the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nTo be part of the communal bank was a great help to our member, Dellys V., because of the loans received that helped her to stabilize economically.  This was thanks to her friend who, as another member of the bank, invited her to become a member.  She is a member that enchants other with her charisma and kindness.  She lives in Cuenca\u2019s outskirts, along V\u00eda a Nulti, with her life partner and their only, 14-year-old daughter.  Her husband has his own machine shop that is located in their home, thus saving on rental costs.\r\n\r\nDellys is a clothing and footwear merchant; she has been in this line of work for several years.  She goes to all the city\u2019s neighborhoods from Monday through Friday but especially on holidays.  Thanks to her work, she has many acquaintances and regular customers to whom she sells her merchandise on credit.\r\n\r\nShe relates to us that she has worked with communal bank loans for two years now.  She will use the funds requested on this occasion to buy pants, shirts, coats, blouses, sports and casual shoes for women, men and children so that she can have a varied stock available for her demanding customers, thereby increasing her business.\r\n\r\n Her goal is to finish building her house because it\u2019s still lacking a few finishing touches.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":493778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy pants, shirts, coats, blouses, sports and casual shoes for the entire family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-24T00:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Dellys Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946453},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946454},{"amount":158.32,"local_amount":158.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":158.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674737},{"amount":208.36,"local_amount":208.36,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":208.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708897},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892194},{"amount":183.3,"local_amount":183.3,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":183.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632604}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T10:23:11Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":183757,"name":"Diotilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora DIOTILIA A.

She lives in Sitio Mahayahay, Brgy. Daanlungsod, Bogo, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions through her own efforts and with the help of her loans from NWTF. By working hard in her fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12000. Maria is now borrowing PHP 12000 so that she can purchase fishing materials. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

From the time he was a young, he learned the honorable work of raising livestock, activities which were passed down from his parents and which today bring him satisfaction. Thanks to his valuable knowledge of the livestock trade, he has been able to obtain good results from his sales. \r\n\r\nThis enterprising gentleman\u2019s wish is to invest more capital in young animals. Abdujabor hopes to continue his dedication to his work, believing that by improving his stock and feed, his livestock will bring better prices. For this reason, he is requesting the support that would permit him to continue developing his business.  \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gari is a type of flour made from cassava and is a starchy food that is mostly enjoyed by students and large families in Ghana. Students eat gari a lot because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They soak gari mix with condensed milk and water, and sometimes add peanuts. Some students also prepare gari in the form of dough and eat it with pepper sauce and sardines. Families also eat gari for lunch or supper, usually served with soup or pepper sauce. The soups that are mostly accompanied with gari are okra soup, groundnut (peanut) soup, palm nut soup, and vegetable soup. Various sauces can also be used to accompany gari, such as pepper sauce, curry sauce, or tomato sauce. The variety of the sauce served with gari depends on the family\u2019s preferences. Any kind of meat or fish can be eaten with these soups and sauces.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the gari, Adjoa obtains raw, fresh cassavas from the market. She washes and peels the cassavas, then sends them to the mill to be milled into dough. She puts the dough in a sack and places heavy stones on it. The stones are placed to drain the starch out of the dough. She leaves the dough for a day or two depending on the weight of the stones. After this process is completed, she stir-fries the gari in a pan on fire. The gari is then left to cool and finally bagged into small bags that are then offered for sale.

housewife. From DINARI's first loan, Made Gelis bought one mother pig, that after 6 months bore 6 piglets. From sales of those 10 piglets, Made Gelis profits Rp 1,100,000 (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp8,000-9,500.00) after subtracting feed and medical expenses. After learning of that good result,  Made Gelis is requesting a second perod loan from DINARI to increase her capital to buy a second mother pig. So that in the next 6 months she could obtain more result than from her first loan. Of course Made Gelis' hope that this second period loan could be useful for her family in the niddle of ever increasing prices of all major daily needs items.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNi Made Gelis sangat menikmati pekerjaannya sebagai peternak babi karena disamping menghasilkan pendapatan bagi keluarga beternak babi juga sebagai hiburan disela-sela kegiatannya sebagai ibu rumah tangga. Dari pinjaman pertama ke DINARI Made Gelis membeli 1 ekor induk babi yang setelah 6 bulan melahirkan 10 ekor anak babi.\r\nDari hasil penjualan 10 ekor anak babi tersebut Made Gelis memperoleh keuntungan bersih sebesar Rp. 1.100.000 dan itu sudah dipotong biaya pakan dan obat. Setelah mengetahui hasil yang demikian bagus itu, Made Gelis kembali melakukan pinjaman periode kedua ke DINARI untuk menambah modalnya untuk membeli induk babi menjadi 2 ekor. Sehingga kedepannya selama 6 bulan akan diperoleh hasil yang melebihi dari pinjaman pertama.\r\nTentunya besar harapan dari Made Gelis pada periode kedua ini hasil yang akan diperoleh akan sangat bermafaat bagi keluarganya ditengah semakin tingginya semua harga bahan pokok keperluan sehari-hari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":169146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy mother pig (Membeli induk babi)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-06-14T21:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made Gelis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-28T22:12:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-07-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":276879.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":280439},{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-09-04T06:09:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:15:46Z","rounded_local_amount":276879.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315404},{"amount":85.83,"local_amount":686666.65,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":792183.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308483},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":233333.35,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":269188.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925431}],"funded_date":"2008-06-14T22:12:00Z","paid_date":"2009-01-22T08:56:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":55904,"name":"Tuulima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuulima T. is a 49-year-old married woman with 10 children.

His occupation is running a cyber cafe located in his home. With three years' experience he has seen great success until now. Only when there are blackouts is when he sees problems because he cannot run his services without the generator, which is very taxing on their energy reserves. He started out with some savings he put away from when he worked in Panama in a columbian coffee processing plant. With the loan he requests he will invest into his business through the purchase of computers. He will then be able to provide more to his clients and obtain a greater income.

Since she was single, she has been devoted to agriculture in her eagerness to progress and turn herself into a prosperous farmer and businesswoman. But when she became pregnant, her work in the field suffered and she had to turn to caring for her son and working as a housewife. Now that her son is older, Clarisa is returning to her agricultural work, planting corn, peas, and other vegetables in the fields she inherited from her parents. This season, she and her son primarily planted corn, but it was not profitable due to low market prices. Now she wants to expand production of higher quality peas, resistant to bad weather and more valued in the market. To this end, Clarisa is happy with her agricultural work. She hopes to have a more profitable crop so that she can afford to educate her son. Clarisa is a client who is very responsible with her payments. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and she gives them much gratitude and affection for allowing her to work.

Most of the members are involved in sales of such items as:  prepared meals, food, groceries, catalog cosmetic sales, American clothing sales, food, party supplies and decorations.  The work of the past two cycles is now beginning to show benefits which creates the need for a new loan so that their businesses can grow and they can increase their inventory in order to offer the marketplace a higher quality product that is more competitive.

de su madre de 80 a\u00f1os y de su hermano menor para qui\u00e9n es como un padre. Los 3 viven armoniosamente bajo un techo humilde pero propio. Gabino desde peque\u00f1o vive rodeado de vecinos y familiares que se dedican a la agricultura, por esa raz\u00f3n aprendi\u00f3 sobre las labores del campo, las que hasta ahora aplica para la producci\u00f3n de verduras y hortalizas. \nA sus 20 a\u00f1os, \u00e9l tuvo que tomar las riendas como cabeza de familia haci\u00e9ndose cargo de sus hermanos menores, ya que su padre falleci\u00f3. De esa manera se consagr\u00f3 a la agricultura, y como las cosechas producen en temporadas, Gabino tambi\u00e9n trabaja como operario en otros terrenos agr\u00edcolas y como alba\u00f1il, as\u00ed \u00e9l puede continuar brind\u00e1ndole educaci\u00f3n a su hermano menor. Considera que la venta de arvejas es m\u00e1s rentable ya que, si no las vende frescas, puede ofrecerlas secas como semillas, cuyo precio se acerca a los 500 soles por bolsa. A parte de la cosecha de papas, que a pesar de dar frutos cada 6 meses, significa un ingreso considerable para la familia. Mas adelante, \u00e9l quisiera ver a sus hermanos realizarse, para dejar a su madre en buenas y seguras manos, ya que con el tiempo su edad no le permitir\u00e1 continuar con las mismas fuerzas. Gabino es muy constante, con \u00e9ste ser\u00e1 su pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 13 de MFP, tiempo suficiente para calificar de bueno y satisfactorio su trabajo con su banco comunal, del que recibe buen apoyo. Con el dinero, Gabino podr\u00e1 comprar abonos, para enriquecer sus sembr\u00edos de papa, las que cosechar\u00e1 para el mes de mayo. Adem\u00e1s para pagar  a los operarios que colaborar\u00e1n en la siembra, cultivo y cosecha. Estima que invertir\u00e1 m\u00e1s de 2500 soles en el proceso.\n\n","en":"Gabino is a hard-working man. At 53 years old, he is still single but he takes care of his 80 year old mother, and his little brother, to whom he is more like a father. The three live happily under their own humble roof. Ever since he was very young, Gabino has lived surrounded by neighbours and friends who dedicate themselves to agriculture, so he grew up accustomed to the labours of the field and he still grows vegetables and herbs. When he was 20 years old, Gabino had to take the reins as head of the family, and look after his little brothers, when his father died. This was how he came to dedicate his life to farming, and while the crops were growing Gabino would also work as a labourer in other people's farms and as a bricklayer, so that he could ensure his little brother's education could continue. \r\n\r\nHe says that the pea harvest is his most profitable crop, because if he doesn't sell them fresh he can still sell them dried as seeds, at a price of nearly 500 Soles a bag. The potato harvest, even although it only comes round every 6 months, represents a considerable income for the family. In future, he would like to see his brothers fulfil their potential,and for his mother to stay in good hands, because her age no longer permits her to live with the same vigour. Gabino is very reliable. This is his 13th loan with MFP, and he has shown himself to be a good worker and part of his communal bank, from which he recieves good support. With the money, Gabino will be able to buy fertilizers to enrich the soil for the potatoes he plans to harvest in May. He will also pay hired labourers for their help in sowing, cultivating and harvesting the crop. He expects to invest around 2500 Soles in the process.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":905200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer and to hire labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T07:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097873}],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T23:39:23Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":355911,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 49 years old and a single mother of a 20-year-old  child.

still a preschooler. Her husband works for the railroad as a railroad switch operator. In order to supplement family income, Suyunbubu has been selling groceries from a rented store starting May 2011. She used a starting capital of 30,000 som (KGS) to start her business and has been successful, as she now has 50,000 som (KGS) invested in her inventory. In order to further grow her business, Suyunbubu has turned to \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) in order to expand her inventory and attract additional clients. Suyunbubu is planning to use the profits from her loan to invest in a livestock business, as it is very profitable out in the countryside.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":931609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

R. is a 21-year-old pepper producer who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in northern Costa Rica. Jos\u00e9 is a dedicated producer and father. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of Cayenne peppers. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. In general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking and cleaning and caring for younger siblings. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting \u2013 working the land as needed. The land they work is their own.\n\nIn addition to his agricultural activity, Jos\u00e9 spends some days working as a labourer in the nearby orange producing factory in order to supplement the family income, but this work is sporadic. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and buys food. The rural zone where Jos\u00e9 and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Jos\u00e9 is working hard for the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \n\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Jos\u00e9 and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\n\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labour and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Jos\u00e9 with the help of his family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Jos\u00e9 will need roughly one year before his peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest. \n\nIn the past, it has been difficult for Jos\u00e9 to gain access to financial services and technical advice regarding farming practices. This has been a factor that has hindered his ability to be as productive as possible. \n\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \n\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA, represents a unique opportunity for Jos\u00e9, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Jos\u00e9 wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighbourhood. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":555663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of seeds and nutrients necessary for the production of peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coquital, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-06-22T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":47957.43},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":48756.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":49569.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50395.49},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":51235.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":52085.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.59},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.92,"local_amount":47957.43,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":48597.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148760},{"amount":277.31,"local_amount":144682.57,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":146612.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428374},{"amount":205.77,"local_amount":107360,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-03T08:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":108792.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289960}],"funded_date":"2010-06-23T07:20:18Z","paid_date":"2011-05-03T08:07:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":212465,"name":"Chepkwony","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chepkwony is a mixed farmer from Litein town in Rift Valley, Kenya.

Nelly was afraid of failing, so she was surprised when she ran out of food because she had gotten off to a great start.  She is determined to move her business forward now that she has many customers, most of whom are drivers and fare collectors who buy the food she prepares.  Nelly prepares meals and soups, which she sells more of now that the weather is colder.  She is very happy that she can help her husband with paying for their children\u2019s education and making improvements to their home.  Nelly wants to have her own restaurant in the near future even though the thought makes her apprehensive.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy ingredients and supplies in bulk, which will help her save more and generate better earnings.  The Communal Bank \u201cMadres Ladere\u00f1as\u201d is a new group and Nelly was recently named its President.  The group consists of ten members who plan to work together.  They all live in the district of Puente Piedra in Lima, Peru.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra.

several years. He is married and the father of 5 children. Abdujabor learned farming business from a young age and now has a lot of experience. His business requires a lot of effort, which is why he dedicates himself to growing potatoes, onions, carrots, etc. This requires a lot of exposure to the sun as well as moving the product long distances. Abdujabor is requesting a loan from IMON International to invest in technological assistance in cultivation. With this loan he will be able to succeed and have better opportunities for the sale of his products after the harvest.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is located at a geographical location where most of the people work as a farmer, especially for Clove. usually the men will go out and work, and the female will stay at home and take care of the family, and only follow them when there is a harvest. However, Ni Putu Sukadani is not like the rest. She does not want to wait for her husband to put food on the table, therefore she started farming pigs. To increase her the quality of her yield, she has obtained financial assistance and training from Dinari. Recently, her sow had just given birth to 10 piglet. She intends to buy high quality pig feedings to fatten her pigs. And she will also used it to renovate her pig sty. Ni Putu Sukadani is optimistic that this will work out, therefor she works hard to ensure that this will increase their living standard. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa by Bernard, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Putu Sukadani tinggal di desa Manistutu, sebuah desa yang ada di Bali barat. Desa Manistutu adalah salah satu desa di Bali barat yang kondisi geografisnya berada di ketinggian sehingga banyak penduduknya yang berprofesi sebagi petani, khususnya petani cengkeh. Kaum lelaki pergi ke kebun untuk mengolah tanah perkebunan dan kaum wanita tinggal dirumah untuk merawat anak dan keluarga. Biasanya kaum wanita di desa ini akan ikut ke kebun kalau pohon cengkeh sudah berbuah dan siap di panen. Ni Putu Sukadani adalah sosok wanita yang gigih dalam mengarungi hidupnya. Ia tidak ingin hanya tinggal dirumah berdiam diri dan menunggu suami datang dari kebun. Untuk membantu menambah pendapatan keluarganya, Ni Putu Sukadani memelihara babi dirumahnya, khususnya babi jenis lokal.\r\nUntuk meningkatkan kwalitas dari usahanya, Ni Putu Sukadani mendapat pelatihan dan pinjaman modal dari Dinari. Saat ini Ni Putu Sukadani memiliki seekor induk babi yang baru saja melahirkan 10 ekor anak. Pinjaman yang didapatnya akan digunakan untuk membelikan pakan yang lebih baik dan bergizi, karena selama ini masih memberikan pakan tradisional sehingga pertumbuhan babinya tidak optimal.

He lives in a neighborhood in the capital of Managua called Altamira in an apartment.  Since he was very small he has helped his family get ahead and through an inheritance from his parents has a driving school, which has successfully obtained numerous clients over the years.

This is 34-year-old Christina M. from Mbeya. She is single. Christina has been running a used clothes store since 2002. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Christina currently earns about US$90 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of clothes for her business. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of her business. Christina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

They have two children who are both in grade school.\r\n\r\nCarmelita owns a general store, which has been around for fifteen years. In addition, she buys and sells fresh pork meat and dressed chicken. Her neighbors order from her. She buys items from the slaughterhouse in large amounts and delivers to her customers. She makes it a point to ensure that the orders be served as promised, although she sometimes finds it difficult to recover unpaid debts from some customers. She also sells RTW (ready-to-wear) clothing.  Her most recent business venture is bicycle rental. From all these activities, she earns more than PHP 32, 000 in monthly profits. She banks most of her income for future use, especially for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nHer membership with the (CCT) Credit Cooperative has brought her a lot of blessings in life and in business. In anticipation of the upcoming holiday season, she has been receiving a lot of new orders for hog meat and chicken. To answer for her commitments, she will need additional capital. She has applied for a new loan with the cooperative in the amount of PHP 31, 000.  This will be her sixth loan cycle with CCT. \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

P. is a merchant in the municipality of Condega. She makes a living tending to her rotisserie business, also located in Condega. She is requesting the loan form Kiva partner Ceprodel with the goal of purchasing construction materials such as cement and iron so she can expand her rotisserie since her demand is very high thanks to her good customer service and the quality of her products. Geysell started the business four years ago after leaving the university. She started with a small site that she has been expanding all on her own. She starts her work every day at 9 in the morning and goes until 9 at night and is almost always helped by her mother. Geysell hopes the purchase of the cement and iron completes all the materials she needs to do the construction and make a much bigger business so she can better serve and expand her customer base. Geysell is single and has a school-age daughter, and she provides for her daughter's education. Geysell's mother also lives with her. This is the first loan she has requested, and with it she hopes to have good results since she depends on the success of her business and improving the conditions will help her work better as well as improve the living conditions for her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Gonz\u00e1lez lives with her husband and three children, 12, 14 and 15, in Costa Hermosa.  She is an exemplary woman and very good in business.  She has been selling merchandise for the last 10 years when her mother inspired her and showed her the business.  She likes to work independently and doesn\u2019t picture herself as an employee in a company.  \r\nCurrently she is requesting a loan of $1,500.00 to put together with some savings that she has and buy items that were requested, like a washing machine, irons, air-conditioning units, and supplies, that she will sell according to the requests by her main customers, housewives.  \r\n\r\n10 years ago she worked with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and was an excellent client. But she had gone to live in Bogota and only two years ago returned to this organization to be able to help her business continue growing.  \r\nWith the working capital she has received,  she has been able to increase the services she offers to her customers, and put the money into the business.  She could take out enough to educate her children and even buy them a computer.  She purchased this so that they would be knowledgeable about technological advances.\r\nCurrently she is very happy because her husband has a good job in Cesar department and she knows that now, with more support, she can fulfill her dream of setting up a big store because he is ready to help her.  She feels proud to be a businesswoman, because she has grown personally and has been able to help her family get ahead, especially in the periods when her husband wasn\u2019t working.  She is also grateful to the Foundation and says that she plans to build a house in the San Pablo development, along with her big store.  Also she will send her son to the university.  These are her three goals.\r\n\r\nOne of her first needs is to buy a new refrigerator because she sells soft drinks and shellfish that she needs to store in the refrigeration.  The one that she has is too small for the demands of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

Her business is located at Juja, a busy market in Thika. Thika is the region in Kenya known for production of pineapples. She has been selling vegetables such as kales, potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, onions and cabbages for the last ten years to the local people, including shop owners, passers-by and students. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is that there are so many other people in the area doing the same business as hers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Do\u00f1a Nico, as she is affectionately known, is 35 years old. She is married and has two children. The oldest is in middle school and the youngest is in primary school. She is from a community where the main source of income is growing corn, avocados and guayaba. She remarks that she sells fruits and vegetables in season. She stocks her fruit every day from the distribution center at 4 a.m., since the freshest fruit is there. She goes to sell it in the market. She is asking for  loan to invest in her produce. Sometimes she grows corn, chayote squash, pumpkins, and radishes to make a little more income.

The community is a little isolated, but it does business in the Districts of Cayara, Huancapi, and Ayacucho. \r\n<p>\r\nRosa B. buys cereals and tubers, and transports them to Ayacucho to sell. Rosa\u2019s husband and children help her with her business. Rosa also brings groceries from Ayacucho and sells them in the local markets of nearby communities. Rosa wants to improve and grow her business, so that she can earn enough to keep her children in school and they can become professionals. They study in the city of Ayacucho and Rosa would be proud to see them become better than her. Rosa says that the community bank meetings have taught her to save, to love herself, and to value herself as a person. She also established a better understanding with her husband and children, and she doesn\u2019t want her children to work on the farm.\r\n<p>\r\nBronita is a nurse, but because of the economic conditions in the country she doesn\u2019t practice this traD.. Instead, Bronita started a business selling cereals and vegetables in Huancapi and Alcamenca. She also promotes good health by selling OMNILIFE products in nearby communities. Bronita would like to have a pharmacy so that her children can study and become professionals. She\u2019d like her children to have better opportunities than she had. Bronita would like to earn enough to buy a house in Ayacucho, and her husband is happy because he also wants to save. Bronita says that her experiences with the communal bank have taught her that people learn to be more responsible and punctual when they work in groups. Bronita also learned to share her family problems, and found the support to overcome them, and to not fear the future.\r\n<p>\r\nElyana buys and sells young livestock., traveling to the remote areas of the local communities to buy the animals. Elyana also buys and sells shoes and clothes that are in style, and she sometimes trades these for animals. Elyana would like to buy a car, which she would use to transport her livestock more efficiently from Ayacucho, thereby improving her business. Before Elyana joined the community bank, she didn\u2019t know how to save, but now she has the opportunity to think about her future. At Bancomunal Elyana has learned to respect herself, and she now earns more than her spouse, and contributes more to cover household expenses. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa comunidad  D.

She now faces an obstacle because she does not have enough money to buy water melon seeds and fertilizer to support the field to make her crop more productive. In order to solve this problem, she decided to ask for a loan for her purpose. Her husband, Mr. Kam Mom, is a construction worker who can make a small income to support the family. Mrs. S.

But, she is a hard-working, responsible woman.  She is dedicated to two businesses: clothing sales and the sale of Esika beauty products.  She has sold clothing for 7 years.  She buys the clothes in Guayaquil from wholesalers twice a month.  She has sold Esika for just 4 months.  She intends to use the funds to invest in her businesses.\r\n\r\nThanks to her good disposition toward work, her businesses are quite profitable and she assures us that they produce good profits.  She has regular customers in Montecristi and in Manta.  She is 25 years old and has been involved in three loan cycles with the foundation.  She is grateful to the foundation because she has had good profits during these three cycles.  She sells women, men and children clothing on one-month credit.  At the end of the month, she collects from her customers, recovers her capital, and acquires products again.\r\n\r\nMaryuri will use these new funds to travel to buy more merchandise; she has several pending orders because the new school term is approaching and May is another good month for high sales volume.\r\n\r\nMaryuri\u2019s dream is to have her own clothing store.  In general, she invests 500 dollars in the business and does quite well.  She also dreams with owning her own home.  Thanks to her work and effort she already owns a lot; now she just has to build the house.

The community is distinguished for being full of ponds, there are ponds everywhere. The members of the group comment that the community is very big in territory and people, and for this reason it was divided into 3 localities a few years ago. Boreje 1st neighbourhood to which this group belongs, 2nd neighbourhood of Boreje, and Barrio el salto are the localities which were previously one. The members of the group are 7 women who work at home and at their businesses. Some of them raise chickens or sheep, and others have a grocery store. The people of this community of Boreje are very simple, respectful, and never refuse to greet anyone even if they don't know each other. The names of the 7 members are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.-Anatalia M. L., Mrs. Anatalia is 53 years old, raises chickens and has a grocery store.\r\n2.-Angelica S. M., is 35 years old and has a grocery store\r\n3.-Teresa F. Gonzalez, is 41 years old and raises chickens\r\n4.-Ma Julia S. S., is 40 years old and raises sheep\r\n5.-Maria Catalina A. Marquuez, is 65 years old and raises sheep\r\n6.-Florentina C. C., is 31 years old and has a mobile phone business\r\n7.-Maribel S. C., is 25 years old and raises sheep\r\n\r\nThe 7 women have known each other for a long time. Some of them are next-door neighbours, and others live a little farther away but they see each other daily. The members decided to call themselves by this name because they had chosen other names but they were all taken by other groups. They therefore chose the name of their community, and that's how this name was settled on. Mrs. Anatalia became the representative of this group and she tells us her story.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anatalia is married, currently raises chickens, and in her house she has opened a curtain to be able to sell soft drinks, snacks, and canned goods - a general store, in fact. Her children no longer live with her. She had 5 children; 2 have already married, 1 daughter is in a relationship, and two more work in Mexico city. They visit her every 8 or 15 days, depending. In her house are only herself and her husband, and what she earns is for the two of them. About her business she says that the chickens are no difficulty for her since she has experience taking care of animals. What worries her is the store, there are times when she gets discouraged because there are no sales, there are things that don't sell, and other days sell more or less. As the sales are low, there are no earnings and no more money to invest. What you sell is what you invest.

The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \r\n\r\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \r\n\r\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\r\n\r\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\r\n\r\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\r\n\r\nSince customers cannot afford to pay for the lamps up front, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the solar saleswomen to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit and then extend credit to their customers.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1449284,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2890,"youtubeId":"fPWuc5-0E1s","title":"Kiva Borrower AVEC-Mali from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1449284},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to buy solar lamp inventory that they will sell in their communities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mopti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":28825,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avec-Mali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":28825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":14000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janessa Karawan","image":1204200}},{"id":672086,"name":"Igimbi Agahikaine Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matia is a Ugandan aged 64 years married with twelve children and living with four of his grandchildren that he is taking care of in Kagadi.\r\n\r\nMatia deals in cattle and goat trade as his stable source of income and also from sale of produce.

Salim was born in 1968 in Khujand, Tajikistan. He is married and responsible for three people including his wife and two children.\r\n\r\nVery dynamic, serious, and entrepreneurial, he is proposing to expand his flock and repair his enclosure. This will enable him to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and its neighborhood, some of whom buy animals from more than 20 km from his village.\r\n\r\nWith this goal in mind, Salim is requesting a loan that will serve him as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also make some investments. \r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
