He is married with 5 children, aged between 1 and 14 years, of whom 4 of them go to school. He is a farmer and has been farming for 10 years now. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy fertilizers for his maize crop. The profits from this business will be used to buy food for home consumption and to pay the school fees for his children.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Meet Naomi, 29 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Koibatek, a remote village in Kapsowar. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last seven years, and she has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and to make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Koibatek area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi, via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry business to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions.

the tender age of 20, Ruth's passion for farming and education drove her to start practicing mixed farming. She is a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandihills area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley escarpments. \r\n\r\nRuth has been farming for the past 15 years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, tea, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. \r\n\r\nRuth is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nandihills area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Ruth could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \r\n\r\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Ruth, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Ruth believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Ruth to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":912.53,"image":{"id":1759452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T15:30:08Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.78,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7077.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7284.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7497},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7716.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7941.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8173.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8412.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8658.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8911.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9171.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9439.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9715.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.95},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":8149.08,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8301.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824660},{"amount":124.36,"local_amount":11054.18,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":11260.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262684},{"amount":40.94,"local_amount":3638.71,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3706.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264863},{"amount":83.75,"local_amount":7444.4,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7583.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601036},{"amount":173.93,"local_amount":15771.87,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":16066.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.5,"payment_id":681377915},{"amount":89.97,"local_amount":8213.36,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8366.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.43,"payment_id":696587589},{"amount":92.61,"local_amount":8708.14,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8870.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.36,"payment_id":711505892},{"amount":97.2,"local_amount":8954.15,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9121.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.53,"payment_id":731022715},{"amount":100.31,"local_amount":9179.76,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9351.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.96,"payment_id":752110910}],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T15:17:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":816407,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty is 37 years old.

With the loan from Kiva, she would like to buy fertilizers of maize. The profits from the business will be used to reinvest in the same business.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Meet Gladys, a farmer from Koibatek, a remote village in Kapsowar, Kenya who has defied the common thinking among most Kenyans that agriculture is only for the older generation. Gladys\u2019s primary source of income is milk, but she also raises tomatoes on her farm which she's named \u201cever blazing farm\u201d. Gladys also engages in other personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. \r\n\r\nGladys practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm, and knowledge from all the agricultural training she has been attending to broaden her skills. She sells her vegetables, eggs, and milk at the nearby market. Milking and feeding her own cow is the most enjoyable part about farming. She is very thankful that dairy farming has been able to sustain farmers in her village. Profits from milk sales have enabled her to take care of her family, and she has always yearned to have more dairy cows. \r\n\r\nGladys is seeking a loan to buy a good breed of dairy cow. She has already identified the breed of cow that she will buy. The cow will produce between 15-20 liters of milk per day. This breed produces milk referred to as \u201cthe ideal drinking milk\u201d because it has all the required quantities of fat and protein. This cow will certainly boost milk production on Gladys' farm which will translate into more sales and better income for her and her family. Because of the potential for high milk production, Gladys will save more money to fully repay the loan.

They are from Maplaisillo, and are characterized as responsible and hardworking, with desires to better themselves. They all know each other and have different work, with which they struggle day by day to get earnings since it is the means of subsistence for their families.  \r\n\r\nThanks to her desires to get ahead, the coordinator is Mercedes and she works selling natural drinks as a street vendor and in her house. She works in her business for some twelve hours every day, from the preparation of the fruit, making the natural drinks, and her sales, work that she does with pleasure since it is the sustenance for her family. The purpose of the loan is to purchase fruit and other materials for making these such as papayas, pineapples, oranges, watermelon, melon, milk, vanilla, cocoa, sugar, bags, glasses, etc. so that in a not-so-distant future she can get more income and maintain and increase her customer base. Dios con Nosotros is grateful for the help that the Kiva investors offer to people of limited economic resources and in poor countries such as Nicaragua to have a dignified means of work.

Meet Beatrice. She lives in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills, carpeted in manicured mango plantations. Beatrice is the mother of three lovely children and she has been in the agriculture business for five years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and maize. \r\n\r\nBeatrice has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, the rising costs of farming inputs (such as fertilizers) and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Beatrice remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Beatrice will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her will be timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of her work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will harvest better quality produce and more yields.

producci\u00f3n y venta de Queso.\nElla es una persona trabajadora, sencilla, humilde, honesta, perseverante, madrugadora, puntual, emprendedora y muy luchadora. Su negocio lo realiza en la localidad de Batallas a una altura de 3735 metros sobre el nivel del mar, distante a 65 kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de la paz.\nYhovana es de tez morena, cabello negro largo trenzado, estatura peque\u00f1a,  ojos obscuros, su forma de vestir es tradicional (manta y pollera), su lengua natal es el aymara y utiliza el espa\u00f1ol para el comercio. Su rutina comienza desde muy tempranas horas de la madrugada, incluso antes de que los gallos anuncien la alborada, en esta localidad de la zona del municipio de \u2018Batallas\u2019, trabajar el insumo l\u00e1cteo hasta darle esa consistencia caracter\u00edstica, es una tradici\u00f3n que es compartida por gran parte de los habitantes. Con pocas ganancias y bastante esfuerzo, diariamente lucha para sacar sus productos frescos a la calle, son muchos los gastos que tiene que hacer para llegar al producto final. El proceso comienza con la leche reci\u00e9n orde\u00f1ada, los envases para almacenar el queso se elaboran con materiales de Totora, propia del lugar. \u201cEste trabajo nos da para vivir honradamente y sin lujos. Con lo que ganamos pagamos las cuentas, compramos comida y seguimos trabajando con el queso para comercializarlo..\u201d, comenta Yhovana.\nEl principal problema de Yhovana es la poca producci\u00f3n de leche, la \u00e9poca lluviosa fue muy corta y no ayud\u00f3 a que aumentara el pasto para alimentar a las vacas. Esto repercuti\u00f3 de manera directa en la obtenci\u00f3n de la leche, la provisi\u00f3n diaria es insuficiente para aumentar la producci\u00f3n de queso, dependiendo de la \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o, el pasto desmejora y esto merma la producci\u00f3n de leche.\nEs por esos motivos que Yhovana solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de vacas lecheras, aumentar la producci\u00f3n de queso y mejorar su calidad de vida.\n","en":"Yhovana is a young woman, 22 years old, single, without children, who works making and selling cheese.\r\n\r\nShe is hardworking, simple, humble, honest, determined, an early riser, punctual, enterprising, and very persistent.  Her business is located in Batallas, at an altitude of 3735 meters above sea level, 65 kilometers from the city of La Paz.\r\n\r\nYhovana has olive skin, long braided black hair, is short, has dark eyes, and dresses traditionally (blanket and pollera [traditional Andean skirt]). Her native language is Aymara and she uses Spanish for business. Her routine starts very early in the morning, even before the roosters announce the dawn in this location in the municipal zone of Batallas. She works the dairy product until giving it this characteristic consistency. It is a tradition that is shared by many of the inhabitants. With little income and a lot of effort, she struggles daily to bring her fresh products to the street. The expenses to arrive at the final product are many. The process begins with the milk recently milked, the containers to store the cheese are made from totora reeds, typical of the region.  \r\n\r\n\"This work allows us to live honorably and without luxury. With what we earn, we pay the bills, purchase food, and continue working with the cheese to sell it...\" says Yhovana. \r\n\r\nYhovana's primary problem is low milk production. The rainy season was very short and didn't help to grow the grass to feed the cows. This had direct impact on the milk she gets. The dairy production is insufficient to increase the production of cheese. Depending on the season, the grass spoils and this reduces the milk production.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Yhovana is asking for a loan to purchase dairy cows, increase the production of cheese, and improve her quality of life.

They average 37 years of age and five children each. They all live in Kalaban-coura, and they know one another as neighbors and through the income-generating activities they conduct in the village. They practice small trade involving bed sheets, condiments and coco.  \r\n\r\nTo bolster their working capital, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance organization. This is their second group loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMrs. Bintou (standing at the far right in the group photo) is a major reseller of second-hand bed sheets in various styles. She plans to use her loan to buy 2 bales of used bed sheets in M\u00e9dine. She retails her stock as an itinerant vendor in Kalaban-coura to a clientele composed mainly of women.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Bintou expects to earn an average monthly profit of 90,000FCFA, which she will use to provide for her household and to reinvest in her activity.

Meet Emmy, a 26-year-old farmer from a remote village in the Koibatek, Kapsowar area. She resides with her husband with whom she has been blessed with one lovely angelic-looking child. She has been actively involved in farming for the last five years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells maize, milk, eggs and various varieties of food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs.\r\n\r\nEmmy is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be useful in feeding the poultry; sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy, and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. \r\n\r\nApart from an increase in egg output, Emmy will get increased output of poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that would have been spent in buying fertilizer. Your loan will bring joy to her family because she will be able to support her family and improve her living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425.37,"image":{"id":1786938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay for poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-06T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T16:30:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.08,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.74,"local_amount":7716.62,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8053.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262716},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":6281.07,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6555.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601074},{"amount":57.71,"local_amount":5017.97,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5236.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459537},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":4703.08,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4908.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":696587622},{"amount":51.02,"local_amount":4682.18,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4886.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.83,"payment_id":711505926},{"amount":47.88,"local_amount":4305.64,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4493.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.63,"payment_id":731022749},{"amount":47.93,"local_amount":4281.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4468.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.31,"payment_id":752110941}],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T11:47:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":824291,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta is 58 years old and married with five children, one of whom is in school.

She has always been enterprising in business and has, from her home, come up with innumerable ways to make money. Eight years ago she started selling beer because she and her partner had two fridges. Later they would buy groceries and a display case to display stationery and other items. They sell food typical of the region (flour or corn or yucca products filled with meat, chicken, egg, and cheese fried in oil). On top of these activities she also sells jeans, shoes, shirts, and children's outfits to her neighbours. She offers easy payment options. She is currently applying for a loan which will be put on Kiva. It is her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

All of her children are grown-up and self-sufficient. Shaiyrbyubyu has a secondary education. She is honest and punctual by nature. Her husband helps her with her business. As the main source of income for her family, she has been practicing livestock breeding since 2004. She started this business with the purchase of one horse. Thanks to Shaiybyubyu's hard work, she currently has 5 cows, 2 horses and 5 sheep on her farm.

Four years ago, along with her common-law husband, she began selling blouses, jeans, and bermuda shorts to their neighbors, friends, and relatives offering the merchandise in exchange for comfortable installment payments. It was such a success that in 2012, they decided to open a clothing store. They rented the location where they currently operate their business, invested in inventory for the store, which is now diversified. They now offer different brands and styles of jeans, shirts, sweaters, footwear, hats, and other clothing items. This has increased their client base and improved their cash flow, since their purchases are now on a cash basis. Their daily schedule is from Monday to Sunday, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. She works with great commitment and dedication, to achieve her goal of expanding her business and open a new location. She is now applying for the first time to a creditkiva loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, by which she will be able to supply her business with new models of jeans, t-shirts, and sweaters, to take advantage of the upcoming Christmas holidays.

children. She dreamed of becoming a painter, going to a university and obtaining a higher education, but at that time her parents did not have an ability to pay for her education, and this is why she got married and became involved in household work. Now Umida works on a field, growing fruits and vegetables that she then sells at a market. Her husband works in Russia and sends money to his family.

Meet Judith from Kapsowar Kenya, a woman from a community not known for farming, but one who is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married, and together with her husband she is blessed with four lovely children. For the past 10 years, Judith has been practicing mixed farming and, due to the experience she has, commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers who regard her as a mentor. Selling milk, eggs and vegetable has allowed her to earn a decent income. To make extra money, Judith also engages in a small personal business. \r\n\r\nJudith passionately loves dairy farming, and one of the animals on her farm has been given a nickname. Milking and feeding her cow makes her very proud. Through her milk sales, she has had quite good returns, and the demand for milk has been expanding. Through extensive use of her mobile phone, she has been receiving orders from customers. Because demand has been overwhelming, Judith is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow, a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce 10-20 litres of rich, creamy milk daily. The increased milk production will result in more income, and Judith will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going children. \r\n\r\nWhen people listen to Judith speak, they can be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming because of her passion and determination. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Judith, and there is no doubt that rewarding employment can be found in dairy farming."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":312.77,"image":{"id":1787034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-06T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T16:40:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.95,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2334.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2402.79},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2473.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2545.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2619.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.23},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2856.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2939.6},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3025.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3113.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.42},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.16,"local_amount":3175.56,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3371.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824707},{"amount":32.07,"local_amount":2740.53,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2909.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262719},{"amount":32.02,"local_amount":2736.24,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2905.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264902},{"amount":31.88,"local_amount":2725.03,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2893.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601077},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":2936.11,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3117.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459539},{"amount":33.48,"local_amount":2912.54,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3092.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.6,"payment_id":681377948},{"amount":35.34,"local_amount":3095.65,"processed_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-08-17T14:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3287.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.88,"payment_id":696587624},{"amount":72.52,"local_amount":6408.76,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6804.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.47,"payment_id":731022752}],"funded_date":"2015-01-16T21:50:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Keaton","image":892591}},{"id":824304,"name":"Elsie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsie is 63 years old and widowed, with three children.

Currently they struggle with their businesses to get ahead and maintain their customer bases and their economic stability. \r\n\r\nThanks to her desire to get ahead, the coordinator has as her job making and selling tortillas. The business is located in her house. She has been working in this trade for twenty years, with the help of her older daughters. This woman's work routine is some twelve hours daily offering her products. She gets up at four in the morning to sift, mill and prepare the tortillas for sale very early. The goal of this loan is to purchase raw materials such as a quintal of corn, bags, lime powder, firewood, a griddle, etc. El Se\u00f1or es Mi Rey is grateful for the help that the Kiva investors offer to people of limited resources and in poor countries such as Nicaragua to have a dignified means of work.

widow, and a mother to three elementary-school-age children. Ladina has a higher education. She works in a school as a teacher of Kyrgyz language and literature. As an additional source of income for her family, she practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 9 years ago. Thanks to Ladina's hard work, she currently has 2 cows, 2 horses and 25 sheep on her farm. On her 1.60 hectare plot of land, she grows beans for sale. Her average cumulative monthly income is 20,000 som (KGS), however this amount is catastrophically not enough for a good standard of living for her family. For the further development of her business, Ladina turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum.\" She is requesting a loan for 25,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep to increase the size of her herd. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock, which will allow her to improve her family's living conditions and provide a good future for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1758275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Aral village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T16:50:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T16:50:32Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ladina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25920,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":681291119}],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T00:42:16Z","paid_date":"2015-07-17T12:51:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hemmings","image":1320491}},{"id":816442,"name":"Daniel Magaji","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel Magaji is a maize farmer from Ranau Danmantai village in Kaduna state.

Daniel Magaji, like other members of Babban Gona, intends to use the extra income to provide food and clothing for his family, and hopes to ensure his children are educated and have professional jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1666175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing for his family thereby eliminating pressure to sell corn at low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T16:50:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T16:50:32Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel Magaji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":50587,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50587}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-01-18T21:44:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":815133,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies to help her coffee crop.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T16:50:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T16:50:32Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-12-23T10:01:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cara Goman","image":1345692}},{"id":816449,"name":"Elina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elina is 42 years old.

Friends Handicraft provides employment, skills-training and support services including financial literacy, emergency funds and scholarships that cover school fees, uniforms and supplies for employee children. This loan will allow Friends Handicraft to create a larger work space so that they can hire more women and fulfill purchase orders more efficiently.\n\nFriends Handicraft works closely with Global Goods Partners who is dedicated to alleviating poverty and promoting social justice.

Kaiyrgul has a specialized secondary education. She is involved in selling bread - she buys bread from bakeries and resells it at a market. Her monthly profit amounts to about 30,000 som (KGS).

The community of Nyamotambe C Taragai village collects their drinking water from a local well because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases often making Nyamotambe C Taragai\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser program offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans and then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from re-contamination. Nyamotambe C Taragai community will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe drinking water. Rael has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are 4 other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Paul, Mogesi, Rael, and Esther.\n\nNyamotambe C Taragai community needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

He is an enterprising man who works every day to bring in the necessary daily sustenance for his home as a producer of sweets at the department level.\r\n\r\nLuis has always had the dream of having his own home to live in and for some time, he has been constructing his own home, but for lack of economic liquidity, he hasn't managed to complete work. For that reason, he is requesting a loan through FUSAI to invest in sand, blocks, cement, iron, laminated sheets, and rafters to terminate construction of his house as soon as possible and to be able to offer his family an appropriate place to live."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1757636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"invest in sand, blocks, cement, iron, laminated sheets, and rafters to finish construction of his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Yohalmo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":26.39},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":31.73},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":32.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35.43},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":39.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.39},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":815166,"name":"Lidia Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Lidia comerciante de venta de ropa y zapatos usados, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n perfumes en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n a quien le gustar\u00eda en un futuro tener su establecimiento en uno de los mercados de la capital, su cr\u00e9dito anterior lo invirti\u00f3 en realizar divisiones en su hogar lo cual ha venido a mejorar las condiciones de vida, ahora Lidia solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar materiales de construcci\u00f3n para continuar mejorando la parte posterior de su vivienda en la cual necesita levantar un muro perimetral para garantizar la seguridad a su familia y la de sus pocos bienes que le han costado mucho esfuerzo adquirirlos, do\u00f1a Lidia va mejorando su casita gradualmente ya que el costo de los materiales est\u00e1n muy caros por lo que va por etapas, esperando culminar del todo la obra muy pronto.

two children and lives in the village of Sisiya in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. As a girl, she watched women in her village mobilize to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Ogilgei self-help group. \r\n\r\nFor the past year, Monica has been actively involved in mixed farming. Because she is from rural Kenya, gender roles still adhere and women do the heavy work of fetching and carrying water and wood, in addition to household chores, childcare and tending crops. Many are left to run farms alone while their husbands migrate in search of paid employment. \r\n\r\nThis has not been a setback because Monica has been making great profits in farming. Kapsowar is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Monica has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. Through the Ogilgei self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Monica joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. \r\n\r\nWith your loan Monica intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money.

She became involved in animal husbandry after getting married. She started to raise livestock and grow potatoes for sale on a land inherited from her father. She bought livestock with the money from livestock sales and now has a herd of fifteen sheep. She likes to work on the field, take care of, feed and raise livestock and sell her harvest. Her daughters help her with all of her activities. Dilorombuvi understands that education is necessary in the present day and this is why she works hard to provide for her children and give them an opportunity to get a college education. Dilorombuvi requested a loan from MDO Arvand to buy livestock feed because she does not have enough of her own money. She hopes for a positive result from MDO Arvand and is grateful for the support and trust."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1755957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Mastchoh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T17:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T17:20:15Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilorombuvi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":767.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":788.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":814.9},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":839.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":875.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":914.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":816491,"name":"I's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I\u2019s group live in a rural village in Prey Veng province in Cambodia.

The group members have small-scale businesses involving Wax 'pagnes' (the colorful cloth of western Africa) and light-weight fabrics, peanuts, charcoal, and condiments.\r\n\r\nConcerned about building their inventory, the group members decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their 3rd solidarity loan cycle.\r\n\r\nMs. Kancoumba (the woman standing at the far left in the photo) is a major vendor of cloth (Wax and light \u2018pagne\u2019) of good qualities.

Accepting cash or credit, she makes her sales retail to a customer base composed mostly of women by going door to door, and sometimes by special order, in Kanadjiguila. With this loan, she plans on making an average monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used for ensuring the children\u2019s healthcare.

It consists of four women from the city of Sana'a, Yemen. They applied for a loan of 180,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nRawda is the leader of the group. She is 33 years old and has five children. Her husband works as a bus driver with a daily wage that is not enough to provide the family with their needs. Rawda decided to help him through working as a tailor. She works inside her house with some small equipment and sewing materials.

Although her responsibilities are critical to her family\u2019s well-being, running the household is considered a mere duty in Kenya, a job with little appreciation. \r\n\r\nHello, lenders! The above picture presents Clementine, a mother who has been practicing agriculture for the last 10 years. She also keeps a dairy cow. Because of her immense knowledge of farming, she commands a lot of respect among other farmers and she is viewed as a mentor in her village. She lives together with her children in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is known for maize plantations and producing milk for export. Her primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Generating an income by selling the harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. \r\n\r\nAvailability of labor is a major challenge for Clementine. Before joining Juhudi, Clementine could not access loans from banks because they considered her a high-risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the Riverside self-help group. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learned about loan management and agribusiness. She also got to learn about Kiva. Clementine is seeking a loan in order to construct a cow shed and to purchase farm implements. With your loan, Clementine will introduce zero grazing (an environmentally sound method of cattle care) and purchase more effective modern tools that will make her farm activities much easier. This will boost her income and enable her to pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nYou can help this woman to improve her farming in order to provide for and educate her four children.

Es el primer  pr\u00e9stamo que  recibido de FUDECOSUR. \u00c9l no hab\u00eda tenido antes otros pr\u00e9stamos en bancos estatales, pero FUDECOSUR le ha brindado el pr\u00e9stamo con mayores facilidades y la tasa de intereses mucho m\u00e1s baja.\n\t\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio, 81 years old, is married and lives with his wife, who is his first priority. With his loan, he means to buy some calves to fatten that have the good characteristics of rapid development and weight gain. The idea is to take advantage of the grazing space he has and the good land and climate conditions in order to be able to have these animals and raise calves in order to sell them for meat in the future. With this purchase, he will be able to develop another activity, and at the same time have some savings that will allow him to go on having more animals and to invest more in the property. This is the first loan he has received from FUDECOSUR. He has not had other loans at state banks, but FUDECOSUR has provided him the loan with easier terms and a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1758640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy beef calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Cedral, Caj\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2014-12-22T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-23T09:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":507283.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624231357}],"funded_date":"2014-12-26T20:51:04Z","paid_date":"2015-03-23T09:33:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":816475,"name":"Noonkida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noonkida is 37 years old, widowed and a mother of five children.

Meet Alice, a very hard-working, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past five years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents. \r\nAlice lives near Kapsaiya in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. \r\nThe Kapsaiya area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Alice intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully, breakdowns will be few and far between. \r\nTo accomplish this, Alice is applying for a 50,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Alice sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. She patiently waits for your kind support. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":532.69,"image":{"id":1787144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a posho mill for processing maize flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-01-06T18:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-02-05T18:10:10Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.31,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.99},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4857.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.05,"local_amount":4525.83,"processed_date":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-02-20T12:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4715.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":611824711},{"amount":49.5,"local_amount":4303.92,"processed_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-03-17T12:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4484.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":624262722},{"amount":49.41,"local_amount":4296.8,"processed_date":"2015-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-04-17T13:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4476.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":636264904},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":4278.69,"processed_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-05-17T13:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4457.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":649601080},{"amount":53.03,"local_amount":4610.92,"processed_date":"2015-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-06-18T13:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4804.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":665459541},{"amount":57.22,"local_amount":5073.13,"processed_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-07-17T14:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5285.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.12,"payment_id":681377951},{"amount":107.69,"local_amount":9900.69,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T15:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":10315.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.17,"payment_id":711505931},{"amount":104.28,"local_amount":9330.62,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9721.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.02,"payment_id":752110946}],"funded_date":"2015-01-19T16:31:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":824211,"name":"Nai's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A mother of six children living in Kampong Speu province, Nai is 51 years old.

For 10 years Grace has been a mixed-farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows maize, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. Grace, however, is taking this a little step further. Grace is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes. The demand for vegetables and other greens are always high. Income from this venture will cover the high farming expenses she has to deal with currently. In the long run, with increased income, she will finally be able to satisfy her family\u2019s basic

She deals in the business of selling animals. She buys animals (baby goats and calves) at low prices, brings them up, and then sells them out in the market at higher prices.

The residents of the town hold large celebrations, the most recent was for the Virgin of Guadalupe, which is celebrated all over the Republic of Mexico.  Silvia is a member of this group.  She is a person who is always smiling and in a good mood, and she is also pleasant and hardworking. She is 24 years old, and is married to Adrian, who works building homes.  Together, they formed a family with 3 children, 2 of whom attend school, as the youngest is just a baby.  \r\n\r\nFour years ago, Silvia started up a business selling sweets outside her home from a small table.  But she listened to a talk at the VisionFund, and requested a loan to expand her business.  Ever since, she has invested in more sweets and snacks that she now also sells outside some schools. With her earnings, she was also able to start up a business buying and selling used clothing and shoes, products that she buys in the capital and then re-sells only on Wednesdays in a small market in her community.  In addition to selling sweets, snacks, clothing, and shoes, Silvia also participates in a business selling seasonal foods.  For example, she sells greens and Mexican black cherries that she makes into a dessert, and she also makes tamales.  Recently, she decided to also sell gelatins that she makes in her house.  \"Fortunately, the business selling gelatins is helping me a lot, as I am getting orders for special events in the community and for schools,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty that Silvia faces is the lack of money to buy all of the materials she needs.  But she is very grateful to VisionFund and Kiva because the loans have enabled her to grow her businesses.  She wants to continue to grow, her goal is to build a shop where she could display all of her products.  At this time, she needs to invest in all of her businesses.  She will buy sweets, ingredients for her dishes, and more clothing and shoes.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are:  Leonarda, Mar\u00eda de la Luz R., Beatriz, Alicia, Juana, Mar\u00eda de la Luz M. and Oralia.

Today, she has 3 cows on her farm. She sells ecologically-clean and delicious milk on a daily basis. The profit from the business allows Sozulkan to raise livestock and prepare livestock feed for the winter. In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum\" Bank to buy a dairy cow in order to get livestock offspring and increase milk sales.

Meet Ruth, a 38-year-old mother of three children, who resides in the Nandihills area in Kenya. She is very humble and a go-getter. Ruth has been practicing farming for the last 3 years on her small plot, where she does mixed farming. Ruth enjoys farming very much, and every day she wakes up to go to the farm and improve her life. Through farming, she has been able to take care of her large family and provide them with their basic needs. \r\n\r\nHaving the traits of a go-getter, Ruth has always dreamed big. She has a vision of owning a large cereal-selling shop. She is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to start the shop and make her dream come true. With your loan, Ruth will be able to improve her income level and to comfortably take care of her family. Ruth\u2019s projections are that, by the end of the first year, she would be able to start another cereal-selling shop, which means more income and improved living conditions.

Now she has a herd of ten sheep. She fattens up and sells them. Her husband works as a supervisor at construction site. They work day and night to feed their family and put their children on their feet. Muhdosa is planning to increase her herd headcount, but does not have a sufficient amount to do this.
